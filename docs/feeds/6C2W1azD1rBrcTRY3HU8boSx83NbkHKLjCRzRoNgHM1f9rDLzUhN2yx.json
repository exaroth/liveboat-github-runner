Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.\n\n// Bio\nJineet Doshi is an award winning AI Lead and Engineer with over 7 years of experience. He has a proven track record of leading successful AI projects and building machine learning models from design to production across various domains, which have impacted millions of customers and have significantly improved business metrics, leading to millions of dollars of impact. He is currently an AI Lead at Intuit where he is one of the architects and developers of their Generative AI platform, which is serving Generative AI experiences for more than 100 million customers around the world.\n\nJineet is also a guest lecturer at Stanford University as part of their building LLM Applications class. He is on the Advisory Board of University of San Francisco’s AI Program. He holds multiple patents in the field, is on the steering committee of MLOps World Conference and has also co chaired workshops at top AI conferences like KDD. He holds a Masters degree from Carnegie Mellon university.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\n\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/@mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">@mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Jineet on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jineetdoshi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jineetdoshi/</a></p>","contentLength":2933,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/96202259/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-23%2F392025719-44100-2-6aba9ca4c13cf.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}]}
