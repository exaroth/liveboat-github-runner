It effortlessly enables us to write simple text and have it transform to rich media.\nIt feels that it has all the right features without in-your-way bells and whistles.</p><p>This is the editor I wanted to have since forever 🙌</p><p>Today, we are proud to present to you <a href=\"https://github.com/avo-hq/marksmith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marksmith</a>. The GitHub-style markdown editor for Ruby on Rails. It supports ActiveStorage and has a few powerhouse features like preview-panel and helper, toolbar, and list-continuation.</p><h2>Seamless markdown editing</h2><p>I feel that the best way to write markdown is in plain-text. I've used those \"markdown wysiwyg\" editors like EasyMDE but they just don't feel natural. I think in text, so I want to write text. Let me just write it like that.</p><p>That's why Marksmith's interface is a plain  where you write plain text. No distractions or any fancy post processing. </p><p>Once I finish writing the markdown I usually click the preview button to see what it would look like and if the body is valid. Marksmith has a built-in preview pane which will render the markdown as HTML.</p><p>Marksmith comes with a  helper which will render that content on your show page or other places with the same HTML that you see in your Preview pane.</p><p>This renderer is easily customizable and extendable in your own app.</p><h2>ActiveStorage integration</h2><p>One of the things I do in editors is to embed media and more often images. Marksmith comes integrated with Rails' amazing ActiveStorage framework for storing files.</p><p>Drag-and-drop files or click the dedicated button to attach files. Images will automatically be formatted as a markdown image and other files will be attached as a link.</p><p>One nice thing I love about GitHub's editor is the list continuation feature. When writing lists, after I click return, I expect that the editor will go on the next line and add a new list item. 🙌 Marksmith does that!</p><p>One request we get very often is the ability to inject images that have previously been uploaded by users, thus not duplicating that content.\nMarksmith seamlessly integrates with Avo and will feature an \"<a href=\"https://docs.avohq.io/3.0/media-library\" target=\"_blank\">Add from gallery</a>\" button to enable that.</p><p>I'd like to thank <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jeremysmith.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jeremy Smith</a> for pointing me toward GitHub's toolbar element and other packages and for providing the <a href=\"https://hybrd.co/posts/stimulus-autocomplete-with-combobox-navigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">code</a> for the ActiveStorage integration ❤️</p><p>Marksmith is available on GitHub as an MIT gem. It's an engine that hooks up in any Rails app quickly and integrates beautifully with Avo.</p>","contentLength":2431,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42917712"},{"title":"Show HN: Lume – OS lightweight CLI for MacOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon","url":"https://github.com/trycua/lume","date":1738496782,"author":"sandropuppo","guid":160,"unread":true,"content":"<p>We just open-sourced Lume - a tool we built after hitting walls with existing virtualization options on Apple Silicon.

It's a library that provides methods for working with musical harmony ‒ intervals, notes, chords. For example, it can parse almost any chord symbol (Fmaj7, CminMaj9, etc) and turn it into notes, or it can identify a chord from a given set of notes.</p><p>I started this project with the idea of using formal grammar to parse chord symbols. I wanted to use it instead of a hand-written parser, which is the common approach among similar libraries. Lua caught my attention because of Lpeg, a Parsing Expression Grammar library that is both fast and easy to use. An additional motivation for using Lua was the lack of comparable libraries for it, even though the language is commonly used in audio programming.</p><p>However, despite being a Lua library, the project itself is written in Fennel — a \"lispy\" language that transpiles to Lua. Fennel has features that make writing code for the Lua platform much more pleasant: a concise syntax, macros, and destructuring — a feature Lua sorely lacks!</p><p>In the process, I definitely learned a lot about music theory, although my new knowledge is quite one-sided. By working on this library, I know a thing or two about types and structure of chords, but I learned almost nothing about their composition and transformation. Perhaps these will be the directions I explore next in the project.</p>","contentLength":1402,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42907765"},{"title":"Show HN: ESP32 RC Cars","url":"https://github.com/mattsroufe/esp32_rc_cars","date":1738435891,"author":"mattsroufe","guid":158,"unread":true,"content":"<p>This is a projected I started that blends both the fun of playing a split screen multiplayer driving game and controlling real rc cars.</p><p>The cars can also be controlled via bluetooth gamepads and is meant to be easily hackable.</p>","contentLength":225,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42901007"}],"tags":["dev","hn"]}
