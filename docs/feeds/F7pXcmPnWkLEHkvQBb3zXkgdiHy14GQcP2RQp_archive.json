I’ve been working on a new visualization for <a href=\"https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen\">Jepsen</a>, a distributed systems testing library. This is something I’ve had in the back of my head for years but never quite got around to.</p><p>A Jepsen test records a history of operations. Those operations often come in a few different flavors. For instance, if we’re testing a queue, we might send messages into the queue, and try to read them back at the end. It would be bad if some messages didn’t come back; that could mean data loss. It would also be bad if messages came out that were  enqueued; that could signify data corruption. A Jepsen checker for a queue might build up some data structures with statistics and examples of these different flavors: which records were lost, unexpected, and so on. Here’s an example from the <a href=\"https://github.com/jepsen-io/nats\">NATS test</a> I’ve been working on this month:</p><pre><code>,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n </code></pre><p>You can tell just by eyeballing the numbers that most attempted writes were acknowledged, and about half of them were later read back. There were just three “recovered” writes where we didn’t know if they succeeded or not, and they later appeared. About half were lost: acknowledged but never read. About half of those were “holes”—writes which were missing even though some later write was read. And there’s a few examples, in case you want to go digging into the history and see what might have happened to specific writes.</p><p>At the same time, there are lots of  questions that are hard to answer statistically. For instance, were the lost writes clustered together in time, or were they spread out? What faults might have happened to trigger write loss? Is data loss universal on short timescales, or do, say, 40% of writes survive? Is the rate of writes uniform over time, or do lost writes happen faster or slower? Did the data loss event destroy all records prior to some time, or did some survive? Could apparent data loss be attributed to slow delivery of messages, or is it likely that the data is truly missing?</p><p>This plot helps answer some of those questions. Time flows left to right. Each operation (measured by its invocation time) becomes a single point. Colors indicate the flavor of that operation: OK, lost, unknown, or so on. Operations are splayed out vertically, in such a way that the aggregate “shape” of the plot traces out the rough throughput of the system over time. Operations from the fault-injection system are shown as vertical lines and (for process kills) horizontal bars spanning them.</p><p>From this, we can see that data loss occurred in two large chunks, starting near a file-corruption operation at roughly 65 seconds and running until the end of the test. They were not evenly mixed: writes were lost in blocks. A few records survived around 87 seconds in, then everything later was lost as well. These OK records in the middle hint that this is “real” data loss, as opposed to readers lagging behind. The rate of OK and lost operations was essentially constant at ~6,800 records/sec. Unknown operations happened  slower–likely due to timeouts. Some, but not all, process kills caused throughput to tank. You can guess that some of them took down a majority of nodes, halting the cluster until nodes were restarted; others were recoverable after a few seconds.</p><p>Jepsen tests can range from a handful of operations to hundreds of millions, and our plots need to work for both extremes. In this case, the plot used single-pixel dots for frequent operations like  and , but for the handful of  operations, switched to a larger cross style. These infrequent operations are often of the most interest, and could easily get lost in the noise, so it makes sense to visually emphasize them.</p><p>This isn’t a  plot yet. I am, for instance, running out of colors to represent all the kinds of faults, and that leads to awkward color-blind issues like the red/green pairing here. There’s a sort of aliasing/moire pattern caused by the point layout algorithm, which divides the history into 512 time windows, computes a height for each window based on throughput, and then spreads the window’s points along the y axis uniformly. I feel like I may be able to use some sort of adaptively-determined transparency and overlapping dots to get something a little closer to a density field, and that might read more clearly, but I’m wary of what might happen when some windows have lots of plots and others have only a few.</p><p>Despite these shortcomings, this plot has been remarkably useful! I’m using them to get an at-a-glance feel for how bad a given test run is, to figure out where in the history I should look, and to refine the checker itself.</p><p>Because there’s lots of ways you could interpret these plots—showing lost elements of a set, highlighting transaction anomalies in an SQL test, showing how read-only and read-write queries are affected by faults—I don’t really know what to name them yet. For now I’m calling them “op color plots”.

It was, quite literally, all over the news.</p><p>Or maybe the articles are sort of true. Each summary disclaims that its findings are based on “the available materials supplied for review”, or “the provided materials”. This is splitting hairs. Source selection is an essential part of the fact-checking process, and Factually <a href=\"https://factually.co/faq\">selects its own sources</a> in response to user questions. Instead of finding authoritative sources, Factually selected irrelevant ones and spun them into a narrative which is the opposite of true. Many readers will not catch this distinction.

It takes a question typed by a user and hands it to a Large Language Model, or LLM, to generate some query strings. It performs up to three Internet search queries, then feeds the top nine web pages it found to a pair of LLMs, and asks them to spit out some text shaped like a fact check. This text may resemble the truth, or—as in these cases—utterly misrepresent it.</p><p><b>Calling Factually’s articles “fact checks” is a category error.</b> A fact checker diligently investigates a claim, reasons about it, and ascertains some form of ground truth.

ICE\nand CBP have flouted these court orders. On October 12th, federal agents\n<a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/12/ice-chicago-albany-park-tear-gas\">shoved an attorney to the\nground</a>\nwho tried to help a man being detained in Albany Park.

Her car was left behind, coffee still in the cup holder, keys still in the car.

HERE’S THE PROOF.</p><p>Welcome to Prothean EGI.\n──────────<p>\nAfter years of research and months of physical development, I’ve been building something that shouldn’t exist yet.</p></p><p>After months of solo development, I put together a small strike force team—the Prothean Systems team—to bring this vision to life.</p><p>Prothean Systems — Emergent General Intelligence (EGI) that lives on your device, remembers everything, and never leaves your hands.</p><p>No servers. No uploads. No corporate AI deciding what you can know.</p></blockquote><p>The demo on <a href=\"https://www.beprothean.org/\">beprothean.org</a> also advertises “no servers” and “zero uploads”. This is obviously false. Typing almost anything into this box, such as “what are the five pillars”, triggers two queries to Wikipedia and ten messages, including a mix of reads and writes, to the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> hosted database service:</p><p>Prothean’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/2528744020845660\">launch video</a> explains that Prothean uses a multi-tier compression system called “Memory DNA”. This system “actually looks at the data, understands its characteristics, and then applies the absolute best compression technique for it”. The white paper lists nine compression tiers:</p><blockquote><p>\n1.  (40% reduction) - Core meaning preservation\n2.  (25% reduction) - Recurring structure identification\n3.  (15% reduction) - φ-ratio temporal organization\n4.  (10% reduction) - Frequency-domain optimization\n5.  (8% reduction) - Relevance-based filtering\n6.  (6% reduction) - Meta-pattern extraction\n7.  (4% reduction) - φ-importance scaling\n8.  (3% reduction) - Age-based compression\n9.  (2% reduction) - Final integration</p></blockquote><pre><code></code></pre><p>Prothean advertises a system called “Guardian”: an “integrity firewall that validates every operation” and “detects sensitive data, prevents drift, enforces alignment at runtime”. The demo does not appear to address drift or alignment in any way. Instead, it matches strings against <a href=\"https://github.com/CaptainFuzzyFTW/beprothean-site/blob/b4ee6a4b6e12a624718c63c6bea615a0b32efeea/index.html#L1247\">three regular expressions</a>, looking for things like e-mail addresses, credit cards, and API keys.</p><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code></code></pre><p>The white paper describes a “Radiant Data Tree” structure, which uses a \"Fibonacci-branching tree structure with φ-ratio organization. The depth of this tree is given as:</p><blockquote><p>Depth(n) = φ^n / √5  (rounded to nearest Fibonacci number)</p></blockquote><p>Depth is <a href=\"https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/15-121/lectures/Trees/trees.html\">a property of a specific node</a>, not a tree as a whole—I assume they mean . In either case this is impossible. The height and maximum depth of a tree are bounded by the number of edges between the deepest node and the root. Trees cannot have a height which grows as φ, because this implies that the depth increases  than the number of nodes. Per this equation, a “Radiant Data Tree” containing just six nodes must have a height of eight—and must therefore contain at least nine nodes, not six.</p><p>The white paper also introduces a transcendence score  which measures “mathematical beauty and emergent capability”:</p><blockquote><pre><code>T = (0.25×C + 0.25×(1-M) + 0.3×N + 0.2×P) × φ mod 1.0\n</code></pre><ul><li>C = Complexity handling (0 to 1)</li><li>M = Memory compression ratio (0 to 1)</li><li>N = Neural emergence score (0 to 1)</li><li>P = Pattern recognition quality (0 to 1)</li><li>φ = golden ratio (1.618…)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Speaking broadly, a quality metric should increase as its inputs improve. This score does not. As each metric improves, the transcendence score rises—until roughly halfway through it reaches one, and immediately wraps around to zero again. Consequently, small improvements in (e.g.) “pattern recognition quality” can cause  to fall dramatically. The white paper goes on to claim specific values from their work which are subject to this modular wrapping.</p><p>There’s a lot more here, but I don’t want to burn too much time on this.</p><p>Based on the commit history and prose style, I believe Prothean is largely the the product of Large Language Models (LLMS).
