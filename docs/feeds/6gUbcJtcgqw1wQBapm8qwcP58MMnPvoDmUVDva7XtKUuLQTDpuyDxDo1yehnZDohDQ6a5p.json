BleepingComputer reports: After a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, the DOJ says that Lu retaliated by embedding malicious code throughout the company's Windows production environment. The malicious code included an infinite Java thread loop designed to overwhelm servers and crash production systems. Lu also created a kill switch named \"IsDLEnabledinAD\" (\"Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory\") that would automatically lock all users out of their accounts if his account was disabled in Active Directory. When his employment was terminated on September 9, 2019, and his account disabled, the kill switch activated, causing thousands of users to be locked out of their systems.\n \n\"The defendant breached his employer's trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S. company,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti. When he was instructed to return his laptop, Lu reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes, and quickly delete files. Lu was found guilty earlier this year of intentionally causing damage to protected computers. After his four-year sentence, Lu will also serve three years of supervised release following his prison term.","contentLength":1854,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Python Surges in Popularity.

And he's just published a new 11-page white paper about open source's \"phantom dependencies\" problem — suggesting a way to solve it. \n\n\"Phantom\" dependencies aren't tracked with packaging metadata, manifests, or lock files, which makes them \"not discoverable\" by tools like vulnerability scanners or compliance and policy tools. So Python security developer-in-residence Seth Larson authored a recently-accepted Python Enhancement Proposal offering an easy way for packages to provide metadata through Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs). From the whitepaper:\n\n\n Python Enhancement Proposal 770 is backwards compatible and can be enabled by default by tools, meaning most projects won't need to manually opt in to begin generating valid PEP 770 SBOM metadata. Python is not the only software package ecosystem affected by the \"Phantom Dependency\" problem. The approach using SBOMs for metadata can be remixed and adopted by other packaging ecosystems looking to record ecosystem-agnostic software metadata... \n\nWithin Endor Labs' [2023 dependencies] report, Python is named as one of the most affected packaging ecosystems by the \"Phantom Dependency\" problem. There are multiple reasons that Python is particularly affected: \n\n- There are many methods for interfacing Python with non-Python software, such\nas through the C-API or FFI. Python can \"wrap\" and expose an easy-to-use\nPython API for software written in other languages like C, C++, Rust, Fortran,\nWeb Assembly, and more. \n- Python is the premier language for scientific computing and artificial\nintelligence, meaning many high-performance libraries written in system\nlanguages need to be accessed from Python code. \n\n- Finally, Python packages have a distribution type called a \"wheel\", which is\nessentially a zip file that is \"installed\" by being unzipped into a directory,\nmeaning there is no compilation step allowed during installation. This is great\nfor being able to inspect a package before installation, but it means that all\ncompiled languages need to be pre-compiled into binaries before installation... \n\nWhen designing a new package metadata standard, one of the top concerns is reducing the amount of effort required from the mostly volunteer maintainers of packaging tools and the thousands of projects being published to the Python Package Index... By defining PEP 770 SBOM metadata as using a directory of files, rather than a new metadata field, we were able to side-step all the implementation pain... \n We'll be working to submit issues on popular open source SBOM and vulnerability scanning tools, and gradually, Phantom Dependencies will become less of an issue for the Python package ecosystem. \n\nThe white paper \"details the approach, challenges, and insights into the creation and acceptance of PEP 770 and adopting Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) to improve the measurability of Python packages,\" explains an announcement from the Python Software Foundation. And the white paper ends with a helpful note. \n\n\"Having spoken to other open source packaging ecosystem maintainers, we have come to learn that other ecosystems have similar issues with Phantom Dependencies. We welcome other packaging ecosystems to adopt Python's approach with PEP 770 and are willing to provide guidance on the implementation.\"","contentLength":3476,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rust's Annual Tech Report: Trusted Publishing for Packages and a C++/Rust Interop Strategy","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/08/10/0449256/rusts-annual-tech-report-trusted-publishing-for-packages-and-a-crust-interop-strategy?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1754836440,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":283,"unread":true,"content":"Thursday saw the release of Rust 1.89.0\n\n\nBut this week the Rust Foundation also released its second comprehensive annual technology report. \n\nA Rust Foundation announcement shares some highlights:\n\n- Trusted Publishing [GitHub Actions authentication using cryptographically signed tokens] fully launched on crates.io, enhancing supply chain security and streamlining workflows for maintainers. \n- Major progress on crate signing infrastructure using The Update Framework (TUF), including three full repository implementations and stakeholder consensus. \n- Integration of the Ferrocene Language Specification (FLS) into the Rust Project, marking a critical step toward a formal Rust language specification [and \"laying the groundwork for broader safety certification and formal tooling.\"] \n- 75% reduction in CI infrastructure costs while maintaining contributor workflow stability. [\"All Rust repositories are now managed through Infrastructure-as-Code, improving maintainability and security.\"] \n- Expansion of the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium, with multiple international meetings and advances on coding guidelines aligned with safety standards like MISRA. [\"The consortium is developing practical coding guidelines, aligned tooling, and reference materials to support regulated industries — including automotive, aerospace, and medical devices — adopting Rust.\"] \n- Direct engagement with ISO C++ standards bodies and collaborative Rust-C++ exploration... The Foundation finalized its strategic roadmap, participated in ISO WG21 meetings, and initiated cross-language tooling and documentation planning. These efforts aim to unlock Rust adoption across legacy C++ environments without sacrificing safety. \nThe Rust Foundation also acknowledges continued funding from OpenSSF's Alpha-Omega Project and \"generous infrastructure donations from organizations like AWS, GitHub, and Mullvad VPN\" to the Foundation's Security Initiative, which enabled advances like including GitHub Secret Scanning and automated incident response to \"Trusted Publishing\" and the integration of vulnerability-surfacing capabilities into crates.io. \n\nThere was another announcement this week.

The collaboration has since expanded. In addition to verifying the Rust standard library, the team is exploring the use of formal methods to validate automated C-to-Rust translations, with support from AWS.
