The goal is to help organizations\nprioritize which vulnerabilities actually matter and use AI to fix\nthem faster. \"Throughout my career, I've seen vulnerability\ntrends going up into the right. It didn't matter how good of a\ndetection\nengine and how accurate our detection engine was, people just\ncouldn't fix things fast enough,\" said Marcelo\nOliveira, VP of product management at GitHub, who has spent\nnearly a decade in application security. \"That basically resulted\nin decades of accumulation of security debt into enterprise code\nbases.\" According to industry data, critical and high-severity\nvulnerabilities constitute 17.4% of security backlogs, with a mean\ntime to remediation of 116 days, said Andrew\nFlick, senior director of developer services, languages and tools\nat Microsoft, in a blog\npost. Meanwhile, applications face attacks as frequently as once\nevery three minutes, Oliveira said. \n\n\nThe integration represents the first native link between runtime\nintelligence and developer workflows, said Elif\nAlgedik, director of product marketing for cloud and AI security\nat Microsoft, in a blog\npost... The problem, according to Flick, comes down to three\nchallenges: security teams drowning in alert fatigue while AI rapidly\nintroduces new threat\nvectors that they have little time to understand; developers\nlacking clear prioritization while remediation takes too long; and\nboth teams relying on separate, nonintegrated tools that make\ncollaboration slow and frustrating... The new integration works\nbidirectionally. When Defender for Cloud detects a vulnerability in a\nrunning workload, that runtime context flows into GitHub, showing\ndevelopers whether the vulnerability is internet-facing, handling\nsensitive data or actually exposed in production. This is powered by\nwhat GitHub calls the Virtual Registry, which creates code-to-runtime\nmapping, Flick said... \n\nIn the past, this alert would age in a dashboard while developers\nworked on unrelated fixes because they didn't know this was the\ncritical one, he said. Now, a security campaign can be created in\nGitHub, filtering for runtime risk like internet exposure or\nsensitive data, notifying the developer to prioritize this issue. \n\n\nGitHub Copilot \"now automatically checks dependencies, scans\nfor first-party code vulnerabilities and catches hardcoded secrets\nbefore code reaches developers,\" the article points out — but\nGitHub's VP of product management says this takes things even\nfurther. \n\n\"We're not only helping you fix existing vulnerabilities,\nwe're also reducing the number of vulnerabilities that come into\nthe system when the level of throughput of new code being created is\nincreasing dramatically with all these agentic coding agent platforms.\"","contentLength":3339,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Amazon's AI-Powered IDE Kiro Helps Vibe Coders with 'Spec Mode'","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/0450211/amazons-ai-powered-ide-kiro-helps-vibe-coders-with-spec-mode?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1763876040,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":232,"unread":true,"content":"A promotional video for Amazon's Kiro software development system took a unique approach, writes GeekWire. \"Instead of product diagrams or keynote slides, a crew from Seattle's Packrat creative studio used action figures on a miniature set to create a stop-motion sequence...\" \n\n\n\"Can the software development hero conquer the 'AI Slop Monster' to uncover the gleaming, fully functional robot buried beneath the coding chaos?\"\n\n\nKiro (pronounced KEE-ro) is Amazon's effort to rethink how developers use AI.

Posted to the kernel mailing list, these guidelines aim to standardize how AI-assisted patches are handled. According to Phoronix, the v3 iteration of the proposal [posted by Intel engineer Dave Hansen] emphasizes transparency and accountability, requiring developers to disclose AI involvement in their contributions. This move reflects broader industry concerns about the quality and copyright implications of machine-generated code. \n\nLinus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, has weighed in on the debate, advocating for treating AI tools no differently than traditional coding aids. As reported by heise online, Torvalds sees no need for special copyright treatment for AI contributions, stating that they should be viewed as extensions of the developer's work. This perspective aligns with the kernel's pragmatic approach to innovation. The proposal, initially put forward by Levin in July 2025, includes a 'Co-developed-by' tag for AI-assisted patches, ensuring credit and traceability.

Its title? \"Move fast and fix things.\"\n\n\n\nLast year, we wrote about why a memory safety strategy that focuses on vulnerability prevention in new code quickly yields durable and compounding gains. This year we look at how this approach isn't just fixing things, but helping us move faster. \n\nThe 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time. We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android's C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one... Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts... In a self-reported survey from 2022, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions. \n\nHistorically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security and key development efficiency and product stability metrics. \n\nWith Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. Android's 6.12 Linux kernel is our first kernel with Rust support enabled and our first production Rust driver. More exciting projects are underway, such as our ongoing collaboration with Arm and Collabora on a Rust-based kernel-mode GPU driver.

Instead of injecting credential-stealing code or ransomware into the packages, this one is a token farming campaign. \n\nAmazon Inspector security researchers, using a new detection rule and AI assistance, originally spotted the suspicious npm packages in late October, and, by November 7, the team had flagged thousands. By November 12, they had uncovered more than 150,000 malicious packages across \"multiple\" developer accounts. These were all linked to a coordinated tea.xyz token farming campaign, we're told. This is a decentralized protocol designed to reward open-source developers for their contributions using the TEA token, a utility asset used within the tea ecosystem for incentives, staking, and governance. \n\nUnlike the spate of package poisoning incidents over recent months, this one didn't inject traditional malware into the open source code. Instead, the miscreants created a self-replicating attack, infecting the packages with code to automatically generate and publish, thus earning cryptocurrency rewards on the backs of legitimate open source developers. The code also included tea.yaml files that linked these packages to attacker-controlled blockchain wallet addresses. \n\n\nAt the moment, Tea tokens have no value, points out CSO Online. \"But it is suspected that the threat actors are positioning themselves to receive real cryptocurrency tokens when the Tea Protocol launches its Mainnet, where Tea tokens will have actual monetary value and can be traded...\"\n\n\nIn an interview on Friday, an executive at software supply chain management provider Sonatype, which wrote about the campaign in April 2024, told CSO that number has now grown to 153,000. \"It's unfortunate that the worm isn't under control yet,\" said Sonatype CTO Brian Fox. And while this payload merely steals tokens, other threat actors are paying attention, he predicted. \"I'm sure somebody out there in the world is looking at this massively replicating worm and wondering if they can ride that, not just to get the Tea tokens but to put some actual malware in there, because if it's replicating that fast, why wouldn't you?\" \n\nWhen Sonatype wrote about the campaign just over a year ago, it found a mere 15,000 packages that appeared to come from a single person. With the swollen numbers reported this week, Amazon researchers wrote that it's \"one of the largest package flooding incidents in open source registry history, and represents a defining moment in supply chain security....\" For now, says Sonatype's Fox, the scheme wastes the time of npm administrators, who are trying to expel over 100,000 packages.

By Friday they'd raised over $157,000, including 295 new Supporting Members paying an annual $99 membership fee, says PSF executive director Deb Nicholson. \n\n \"It doesn't quite bridge the gap of $1.5 million, but it's incredibly impactful for us, both financially and in terms of feeling this strong groundswell of support from the community.\"\n\n\nCould that same security project still happen if new funding materializes? The PSF hasn't entirely given up. \"The PSF is always looking for new opportunities to fund work benefiting the Python community,\" Nicholson told me in an email last week, adding pointedly that \"we have received some helpful suggestions in response to our announcement that we will be pursuing.\" And even as things stand, the PSF sees itself as \"always developing or implementing the latest technologies for protecting PyPI project maintainers and users from current threats,\" and it plans to continue with that commitment.\n \n\n\nThe Python Software Foundation was \"astounded and deeply appreciative at the outpouring of solidarity in both words and actions,\" their executive director wrote in a new blog post this week, saying the show of support \"reminds us of the community's strength.\" \n\nBut that post also acknowledges the reality that the Python Software Foundation's yearly revenue and assets (including contributions from major donors) \"have declined, and costs have increased,...\"\n\n\nHistorically, PyCon US has been a source of revenue for the PSF, enabling us to fund programs like our currently paused Grants Program... Unfortunately, PyCon US has run at a loss for three years — and not from a lack of effort from our staff and volunteers! Everyone has been working very hard to find areas where we can trim costs, but even with those efforts, inflation continues to surge, and changing U.S. and economic conditions have reduced our attendance...\nBecause we have so few expense categories (the vast majority of our spending goes to running PyCon US, the Grants Program, and our small 13-member staff), we have limited \"levers to pull\" when it comes to budgeting and long-term sustainability... \n\nWhile Python usage continues to surge, \"corporate investment back into the language and the community has declined overall. The PSF has longstanding sponsors and partners that we are ever grateful for, but signing on new corporate sponsors has slowed.\" (They're asking employees at Python-using companies to encourage sponsorships.)\n\n\n\nWe have been seeking out alternate revenue channels to diversify our income, with some success and some challenges. PyPI Organizations offers paid features to companies (PyPI features are always free to community groups) and has begun bringing in monthly income. We've also been seeking out grant opportunities where we find good fits with our mission.... We currently have more than six months of runway (as opposed to our preferred 12 months+ of runway), so the PSF is not at immediate risk of having to make more dramatic changes, but we are on track to face difficult decisions if the situation doesn't shift in the next year. \n\n\nBased on all of this, the PSF has been making changes and working on multiple fronts to combat losses and work to ensure financial sustainability, in order to continue protecting and serving the community in the long term. Some of these changes and efforts include: \n\n — Pursuing new sponsors, specifically in the AI industry and the security sector\n — Increasing sponsorship package pricing to match inflation\n — Making adjustments to reduce PyCon US expenses\n — Pursuing funding opportunities in the US and Europe\n — Working with other organizations to raise awareness\n — Strategic planning, to ensure we are maximizing our impact for the community while cultivating mission-aligned revenue channels \n\nThe PSF's end-of-year fundraiser effort is usually run by staff based on their capacity, but this year we have assembled a fundraising team that includes Board members to put some more \"oomph\" behind the campaign. We'll be doing our regular fundraising activities; we'll also be creating a unique webpage, piloting temporary and VERY visible pop-ups to python.org and PyPI.org, and telling more stories from our Grants Program recipients... \n\nKeep your eyes on the PSF Blog, the PSF category on Discuss, and our social media accounts for updates and information as we kick off the fundraiser this month. Your boosts of our posts and your personal shares of \"why I support the PSF\" stories will make all the difference in our end-of-year fundraiser. If this post has you all fired up to personally support the future of Python and the PSF right now, we always welcome new PSF Supporting Members and donations.\n","contentLength":4889,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","slashdot"]}
