In a post on X, the Carter Center said that Jimmy Carter died peacefully, surrounded by his family. The former US president governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women's rights and America's global role. \n\nHis achievements in office included brokering a landmark peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1978 known as the Camp David Accords. For that he would later win the Nobel Peace Prize. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy, largely shaped by his work after leaving the presidency in 1981. \n\nHe was the first US president to live to be a 100 years old. \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#JimmyCarter #USA #CampDavid","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/yfO5mGADqx0?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Former US President Jimmy Carter, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, has died at 100 | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvPIH9g7C94","date":1735516029,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"content":"The American flag was lowered at the White House following the announcement of the death of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\n#News #jimmycarter #uspresident #unitedstatesofamerica #Reuters #Newsfeed #politics #obituary \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/40fYqj3\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ZvPIH9g7C94?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Poland to close the border with Belarus.
