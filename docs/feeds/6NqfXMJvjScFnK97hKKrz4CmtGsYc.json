personal choice or nature.\"&nbsp;</p><h2 data-component=\"Heading\">Comments dismissed as bid to 'rebrand' Taliban</h2><p>Mr Stanikzai was once the head of the Taliban team in talks that led to the

Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Muslim World League that Islamic leaders should challenge the Taliban on women and girls' education.</p><p>Ms Akbar highlighted the broader repression under the Taliban including banning women from work, singing or being heard in public.</p><p>\"Access to education is not meaningful progress if women cannot freely move, speak, or participate in public life,\" Ms Akbar said.</p><p>She called on the international community to remain vigilant against attempts to use partial reforms to win legitimacy.&nbsp;</p><div
