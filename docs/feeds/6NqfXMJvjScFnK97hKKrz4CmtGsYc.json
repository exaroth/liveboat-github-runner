In this edition of Berlin Briefing, DW’s Richard Walker and Michaela Küfner break it all down with writer John Kampfner. Who is Friedrich Merz? Why did he have a feud with Angela Merkel?

The calculated overcharge was $1.23 — six per cent on the $21.29 bill.</p><p><a href=\"https://inspection.canada.ca/en/food-labels/labelling/industry/general-principles#a21\">Under federal regulations</a>, posted net weights for packaged food — and prices based on that weight —&nbsp;can't include the packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>\"It makes me angry,\" said Eakins, who sent an online complaint to the store. \"I really don't like to think that I'm paying for packaging. Grocery prices have gotten horrendous over the last couple of years.\"</p><p>CBC's investigation has sparked anger among shoppers who are grappling&nbsp;with high food prices.</p><p>It also prompted NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to ask the Competition Bureau to \"hold these giant corporations accountable\" and provide better protections for shoppers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the big grocers are making efforts to convince customers there's no need for concern.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In November 2024,&nbsp;CBC&nbsp;News found underweighted meat at a Sobeys-owned FreshCo store in Toronto. At the time, Sobeys said it was addressing the matter.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to the Halifax&nbsp;case, Sobeys spokesperson Karen White-Boswell thanked CBC&nbsp;News for alerting the grocer.</p><p>\"On the rare occasions when an error occurs, we respond immediately… so that it can be corrected,\" she said in an email.&nbsp;</p><p>Eakins said a Pete's Frootique representative offered her compensation for being \"mischarged.\" &nbsp;</p><p>\"I said, 'I actually don't want to be compensated. What I want is the assurance that every package of meat I buy from now on, I won't be paying for the packaging.'\"</p><p>White-Boswell says Sobeys has followed up with the store and reinforced its meat-weighing procedures and policies.</p><p>Loblaw customer&nbsp;Iris Griffin also wants assurance the meat she's buying has been weighed properly.&nbsp;</p><p>In late 2023, Griffin complained to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) about underweighted meat she bought at a Loblaw-owned Superstore. The grocer said it sold \"a small number\" of underweighted meat products across 80 stores due to an error involving a change in packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>The CFIA says it issued no penalties because Loblaw said it&nbsp;fixed the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Close to one year later, CBC News found underweighted meat in two Loblaw stores.&nbsp;In response, Loblaw apologized to customers, and said it fixed the error and refreshed in-store training.&nbsp;</p><p>Following her experience, Griffin says she was \"pleasantly surprised\" to learn that a proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed in Federal Court.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit alleges Loblaw, Sobeys and Walmart misrepresented the weight of meat products by including the weight of the packaging, or by \"other similarly deceptive means.\"</p><p>The suit has yet to be certified. Nevertheless, Griffin hopes it sends a message.&nbsp;</p><p>\"It gives people a sense that something is being done and that the retailer is being held accountable for the money that they've taken from consumers,\" she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Loblaw and Sobeys did not comment on the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart also did not respond directly to the suit. But the retailer, in response to CBC News's earlier&nbsp;investigation&nbsp;— which found a Richmond, B.C., location sold underweighted meat&nbsp;— said&nbsp;that the third party responsible&nbsp;had immediately corrected the problem.</p><p>That third party confirmed&nbsp;that the issue had been \"limited to select products\" and only happened \"during a two-week period in December 2024,\" said Walmart spokesperson&nbsp;Stephanie Fusco.</p><p>But CBC News spoke with a customer who complained on social media back in October — two months earlier — that the beef steak she bought at the store had been weighed with the packaging. A photo she took of her weighing the meat showed that it&nbsp;was packaged on Oct. 8, 2024.</p><p>In response, Fusco said that Walmart is looking into the matter. She added that while this issue \"has been limited to third-party packaging,\" Walmart is reviewing its weighing systems to ensure it remains compliant.&nbsp;</p><h2>Investigation by phone and email</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Griffin says she was surprised to learn that when the CFIA investigated her complaint about underweighted beef sold by Loblaw,&nbsp;the agency&nbsp;didn't inspect any stores&nbsp;but, instead, conducted the&nbsp;investigation by phone and email.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Jay Jackson inspected consumer products, including food&nbsp;— for a predecessor&nbsp;of the CFIA&nbsp;— from 1983 to 1987. He says, during this period, a complaint like Griffin's would automatically prompt onsite inspections.&nbsp;</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>WATCH | Proposed class-action lawsuit filed:</strong></em></div><p dir=\"ltr\">\"We would pick up our scales and go to the place and check not only the product in question, but the entire meat counter to see if this is a systemic problem,\" he said. Jackson added that inspectors would also immediately remove any meats that violated the regulations.</p><p>The CFIA&nbsp;says it didn't need to visit any Loblaw stores because the grocer reported it had fixed the error.</p><p><a href=\"https://inspection.canada.ca/en/inspect-and-protect/food-safety/under-weight-and-under-filled-food-products\"></a> about food weight accuracy, launched by the CFIA&nbsp;this week, the agency says its inspectors \"regularly go on site\" for investigations.</p><p>Jackson also says that when he was on the job, inspectors frequently did routine inspections in grocery stores to ensure food was weighed accurately. He and several other former CFIA inspectors told CBC News the agency now does too few of these types of inspections.</p><p>\"It's not a great time for rigorous oversight of consumer fraud protection,\" said Jackson, who is now director of policy and strategy with the Consumers Council of Canada.</p><p>CFIA spokesperson Patrick Girard said in an email that the agency \"works every day to protect consumers\" from mislabelled food by doing inspections, surveillance, responding to complaints and raising awareness.</p><p>The CFIA said that it did 125 planned inspections in the past year for weight accuracy. When asked how many of them were done in grocery&nbsp;stores, the agency replied that such data isn't available.</p>","contentLength":6055,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1i92ps7/more_underweighted_meat_uncovered_as_big_grocers/"},{"title":"Donald Trump in fiery call with Denmark’s prime minister over Greenland","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/ace02a6f-3307-43f8-aac3-16b6646b60f6","date":1737742134,"author":"/u/Affectionate_Cat293","guid":608,"unread":true,"content":"<div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-offer-type=\"print\"><ul></ul></div>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1i91tt7/donald_trump_in_fiery_call_with_denmarks_prime/"},{"title":"Massive protests in Slovakia against the current government","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1i91ovz/massive_protests_in_slovakia_against_the_current/","date":1737741794,"author":"/u/g46152","guid":609,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"LIVE: Newark Mayor Baraka discusses ICE raids in New Jersey","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJuytYognr4","date":1737740977,"author":"Reuters","guid":464,"unread":true,"content":"<article>New Jersey's Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, elected officials and community organizations hold a news conference a day after U.S. immigration agents rounded up undocumented migrants as well as American citizens in a raid of a Newark worksite that the mayor said involved detaining a military veteran and violations of the people's rights.\n \n#Live #Newark #ICE #ICEraids #NewJersey #immigration #RasBaraka #MayorRasBaraka #politics #DonaldTrump #Trump #news #Reuters\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/</article>","contentLength":537,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/iJuytYognr4?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Yo-Yo Ma gives glacier-inspired Davos performance","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjckBMzGJJY","date":1737740760,"author":"Reuters","guid":463,"unread":true,"content":"<article>🏔️ Cellist Yo-Yo Ma gave an outdoor performance dedicated to glaciers as political and business leaders were gathered for the World Economic Forum.

a message from Vladimir Putin. “They told me I should step down, that they would replace me with the pro-Russian Medvedchuk, and I’d no longer be president,” he continued.</p><p>Russia also demanded that Kyiv relinquish control over Donbas, reduce its troop numbers to 50,000, enshrine its neutrality in a re-written constitution, give up most of its long-range weapons, and make a commitment not to join NATO, Zelensky said.</p><p>The same demands had also been made by Russia at the unsuccessful peace talks held in Istanbul between February and April 2022, Zelensky continued, while stressing that “there were no talks” in Istanbul, only “an ultimatum from a murderer”.</p><p>A key Kremlin ally who claims to be close to Vladimir Putin, Viktor Medvedchuk headed the pro-Kremlin party Opposition

Musk played a major role in financially backing Trump and also promoting him on X.</p><p>Additionally, Musk stirred controversy this week when he made a gesture that <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/musk-germany-salute-nazi-2019503\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many have interpreted as a Nazi salute</a>, which Musk has denied and wholesale rejected as an attack by \"radical leftists.\" Those who have denied the gesture as a Nazi salute instead argued that Musk was trying to \"send my heart\" to the crowd or was making a Roman salute.</p><p>However, some different Reddit sub-pages have taken the decision to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-reddit-ban-subreddit-list-2018763\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ban users from posting X links</a> as a form of protest against Musk: The Formula 1 subreddit is the highest-profile group to adopt the ban, followed by the PC gaming subreddit and the pro-Ukraine subreddit NAFO.</p><p>As a \"very large platform\" with over 45 million users <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-vlops\">per the DSA classification</a>, X is required (among other things) to \"identify, analyze, and assess systemic risks that are linked to their services,\" particularly illegal context, risks to fundamental rights (including freedom of expression), risks to public security and electoral processes, and gender-based violence, public health and well being of minors.</p><p>Some officials in Europe believe that X has failed to adhere to these commitments, but whether they can take action against the platform, and what action they can take, remains a complicated question.</p><p>Jean Cattan, general secretary of France's National Digital Council (Cnum) has warned that trying to ban X is \"not at all a simple path\" while insisting that it remains \"realistic but extreme,\" according to the AFP.</p><p>In order to pursue any such ban, the E.U. would rely on either the Digital Services Act (DSA) or the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into effect in 2024. Former European Commissioner Thierry Breton argued that these two acts would allow the 27-member bloc to enforce a ban across all member states.</p><p>Through the powers of the DSA, the <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/european-union\" data-sys=\"1\">European Union</a> opened an investigation into X in 2023 over allegations the platform failed to address \"illicit content and disinformation\" following a significant decrease in X content moderation, according to .</p><figure data-gtm-category=\"Related In-Text A\" data-gtm-action=\"Click\"></figure><p>The AFP noted, however, that the DSA has \"no provision ... for a platform to be banned for good,\" with a \"maximum penalty\" that can be ordered by a judge. A suspension would be a last resort after a fine of up to 6 percent of the platform's worldwide annual revenue.</p><p>X is forecast to record around $2 billion in global ad revenue in 2024—a significant drop from its $4.5 billion revenue in 2022, according to British business magazine 's Asia branch.</p><p>Cattan complained about the mechanism, telling the AFP that the recent troubles involving an alleged <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tiktok\" data-sys=\"1\">TikTok</a> campaign backed by Russia to boost a far-right candidate proved \"the DSA does not allow us to react swiftly enough.\"</p><p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot earlier this month urged the European Commission to either apply \"as strictly as possible the laws we've passed to protect our public space\" or \"agree to return the capacity to do this to the member states.\"</p><p>Any action might have to happen through regulators in Ireland, where X has its European headquarters.</p><p><strong>Jordan Bardella, President of the French far-right party National Rally, </strong></p><p>In the video, Bardella suggested that French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wanted a ban on X.  determined that leaders have not called for a ban but have alluded to \"action\" against the platform if it has been deemed to have violated the DSA.</p><p><strong>Florian Philippot, leader of French nationalist and Eurosceptic party The Patriots</strong>, on X criticized Bardella for not voting against the DSA and accused the E.U. of \"killing freedom of expression a little more every day.\"</p><p>However, <strong>Chloe Ridel, European Member of Parliament for the Socialist Party, </strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ChloeRidel/status/1879114020122173440\">wrote on X</a>: \"Freedom of expression applies within the limits of the law, but it is not respected on X who: - rigs the algorithm to boost certain posts over others. - ⁠ allows hate speech to flourish. What is at stake is our sovereignty: would you therefore accept that an American billionaire puts up millions of election posters without control in France?\"</p><p>The investigation into X will continue, especially in light of Musk's repeated attacks against European officials over perceived violations of free speech. The European Commission just last week announced new steps to the investigation, with pressure increasing on investigators after Musk's chat with AfD leader Alice Weidel.</p><p>There will also be increased scrutiny on X as the upcoming German election draws near, which is set to occur on February 23, 2025.</p><p><em>Correction on 01/24/2025 at 9:20 a.m. ET.
