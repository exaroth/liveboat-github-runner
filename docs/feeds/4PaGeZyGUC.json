And the trend is rising. The German harvest can‚Äòt meet this demand and that‚Äôs why many berries are imported. From places where their cultivation is bad news for both people and for nature itself.\n\nSouthern Portugal is a booming region for berry production in Europe. The country‚Äôs cultivation zone has increased fivefold in recent years - to almost 5,000 hectares. One of the producers: Logofruits. The Portuguese company grows blueberries on its plantation in Odemira on 75 hectares of land. For the owner, Louren√ßo de Botton, the biggest challenge is finding enough workers for the harvest season. Blueberries have to be picked by hand, a labor-intensive process that requires Logofruits to employ around 600 workers per day. Many of those toiling in the orchards in the Alentejo region come from Nepal, India or Bangladesh.\n\nOdemira‚Äôs mayor H√©lder Guerreiro explains that almost 11,000 migrant workers from over 80 countries now live here. This corresponds to around 40 per cent of the municipality's population. Although on the one hand it‚Äôs a great opportunity for the region, which has struggled with emigration in the past, it also presents a huge social challenge. Another problem, according to Guerreiro, is intensive farming‚Äôs huge demand for water.\n\nOne thing‚Äôs for sure: a growing appetite for berries in Germany has consequences for the countries where they are grown. Blueberries and raspberries also grow in Germany, but not all year round. In summer, supermarkets should be full of regional fruit. But they‚Äôre not. Even during the domestic season, more and more produce from abroad can be found on the fresh produce shelves. What does this mean for German berry producers?\n\nErik Appel from Darmstadt grows raspberries, among other things. However, berries cultivated in Germany are completely different to those that have been shipped over long distances. These varieties have been bred to be particularly robust and long-lasting. When it comes to raspberries from the region for the local market, flavor is paramount. And in that respect, says Erik Appel, nothing beats local berries. In terms of labor costs however, it‚Äôs almost impossible to compete with imported goods. After all, Germany has one of the highest minimum wages in Europe. This is reflected in the price - imported goods are often cheaper than regional berries.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, creative coding has a high barrier to entry due to the breadth of knowledge and coding skills required. This talk aims to lower that barrier for you to take home and practice creative coding.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about #algorithms and techniques for generative art using a pure #FunctionalParadigm. First, shepherding random numbers to simulate the universality of nature patterns that appear in plants, rocks, sand, and smoke. Next, using L-system formal grammar to create a seemingly infinite, but well-structured, series of graphics. Lastly, interfacing with printers to bring your drawing to life.\n\nFor you to get the most out of this talk, you should be comfortable working in a functional language of your choice. Although I will introduce some theory, background in mathematics and formal theory is not required to attend.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Matthew ‚Ä¢ Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DVZEaw\nAmir Husain ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4ak3BBJ\nMatt Pearson ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/40cm0vS\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#FunctionalProgramming #FunctionalGenerativeArt #XavierHo #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

The ultra-right has managed to gain a foothold at the very heart of US politics. As part of a strategy to win the 2024 election, it was ready to create a social divide similar to that of the secessionist wars, plunge the country into chaos and cause democracy to totter.\nThe triumph of the radical right is the outcome of a well-thought-out strategy set in motion more than 40 years ago by a conservative minority thirsty for power. And this group has pushed through its agenda under the nose of the world. Today, we can see how successful its strategy was: The ultra-right has gained control of the key centers of power, a process accelerated on all levels by Donald Trump. With his help, the ultra-right now has control of the Supreme Court. Its advance continues unabated, with Trump‚Äôs election victory marking an interim high point. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This film shows how this commitment became a pillar of society. What measures are needed today to defend humanist values and preserve democratic achievements?\n\nThe film provides an insight into the challenges and hopes of remembrance culture work and examines how the motto ‚Äònever again‚Äô is evolving into an educational policy obligation in Germany.\n\nWith the end of the Second World War, two words became an integral part of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany: ‚ÄòNever again‚Äô. Never again fascism, never again war, never again a dictatorship like National Socialism, in which minorities are persecuted, disenfranchised and murdered. This endeavor gave rise to a culture of remembrance, which manifested itself in the form of education in schools, memorials and days of remembrance.\n\nBut sometimes, it seems like the more frequently these words appear in official speeches, the more they lose their clarity and meaning. The discourse on a meaningful culture of remembrance is mainly conducted in academia, and often doesn‚Äôt consider the realities of life in society at large.\n \nThe documentary is an incisive and confrontational look at practical remembrance work. It shows what measures need to be taken to protect democracy and human rights in Germany. It focuses on the everyday lives of those who put the culture of remembrance into practice, and those who benefit from it.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But this film documents a bleak scenario -- in which microcredits have destroyed entire families. Over-indebtedness has driven some recipients to suicide.\n\nExpectations were high. When Muhammad Yunus, the \"banker to the poor‚Äù and founder of the Grameen Bank for microfinance in Bangladesh, received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2006, it was clear to many that the principle of helping people to help themselves would lift many out of poverty. \n\nFrom the 1980s to the early 2000s, microcredits were seen as one of the best tools for combating poverty. However, the loans, which were initially seen as a positive inflow of liquidity, quickly led to further financial obligations for many families. After all, interest had to be paid on these loans. Illegal lenders stepped in. The pressure on families became unbearable, leading to the sale of land, migration, the break-up of families and ultimately even suicide.\n\nThe film tells the stories of three Cambodian families. Along the way, it debunks the myth of microfinance as a tool that truly helps the poor. Told through the eyes of the protagonists and through their personal experiences, this film highlights the hardships faced by so many Cambodians because of debt. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cambodia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place ‚Äì soldiers sharing their diaries.\n\nOur speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!\n\nThis lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more videos about arms and armour  \n\nHelp us bring history to life by supporting us here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nSign up to our museum membership scheme here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/ \n\n‚öîWebsite: https://royalarmouries.org/home\n‚öîBlog: https://royalarmouries.org/stories/\n‚öîFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyalArmouriesMuseum/\n‚öîTwitter: https://twitter.com/Royal_Armouries\n‚öî Instagram: http://instagram.com/royalarmouriesmuseum\n\nWe are the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national collection of arms and armour.

Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with actor Laurence Fishburne to explore the science of The Matrix, simulation theory, and who has the better deep voice. Would you take the red pill? \n\nWould you rather have truth or normalcy? We explore the choice Morpheus presents Neo and how it pertains to science. Laurence shares the experience of bringing Morpheus to life. He and Neil unpack the film‚Äôs profound symbolism as well as discuss the blending of ancient mythology with the emerging digital age.\n\nWe analyze the plausibility of the movie‚Äôs central premise. Can humans really serve as batteries for machines? We explore simulation theory, pondering whether our universe could be one of many nested simulations, as posed by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom. From the optical science behind the iconic spoon-bending scene to the film‚Äôs intricate religion and philosophy, we explore the storytelling elements that make The Matrix timeless.\n\nNeil connects its themes to questions about reality, truth, and human potential. Plus, a few surprises‚Äîincluding the ‚Äúdeep voice-off‚Äù and musings on why gods always have baritone voices‚Äîmake this episode a must-listen for movie buffs and science enthusiasts alike.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Laurence Fishburne\n1:45 - Laurence‚Äôs Scientific Filmography\n10:00 - The Deepest Voice\n14:21 - THE MATRIX (Spoiler Alert)\n19:00 - Religion &amp; Mythology in The Matrix\n32:05 - The Spoon &amp; Optics\n33:29 - Smart People in Movies\n35:50 - Would You Take the Red Pill?\n37:00 - Using Humans As Batteries\n41:55 - Simulation Theory\n46:40 - Living in the Matrix\n49:20 - Talking Shakespeare\n55:12 - How Neil and Laurence Met\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

But this knowledge is in danger of disappearing. Leticia Yawanawa has an ambitious plan: she wants to preserve herbal medicine for posterity.\n\nThe deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest is having a devastating impact on the global climate. But it is also displacing indigenous tribes and eradicating their unique knowledge of the healing powers of nature. \nScientists agree that only a third of the total biodiversity of the rainforest has been researched. Much of the knowledge is in the heads of indigenous scholars. This understanding is passed on orally, from generation to generation. Many tribes are being driven out of their habitats. The knowledge of the shamans - who in addition to their spiritual duties treat their people medicinally using plants and herbs from the jungle - is in danger of being lost forever. \nIn the documentary, Leticia brings together shamans from different tribes and asks them to share their knowledge. They set off on journeys through the rainforest, often lasting days. Here, they share their knowledge of medicinal plants, along with traditional rites and ceremonies. We learn about the healing powers of plants and herbs. Some may be familiar to us, while others are known only to local indigenous populations. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #brazil #amazonrainforest \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
