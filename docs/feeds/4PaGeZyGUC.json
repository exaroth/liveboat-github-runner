She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family’s fate played no role in her life.\n\nBut when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. \n\nEva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. \n\nHer mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva’s young life.\n\nDuring her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.\n\nBut a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. \n\nLater in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #holocaustsurvivor \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.\n\nLooking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nTod Golding • Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures\n (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) Adam Tornhill • Software Design X-Rays\n (https://amzn.to/3DEeEnI) Adam Tornhill • Your Code as a Crime Scene\n (https://amzn.to/3FI5E2V) Matthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais • Team Topologies\n (http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ) Monica Beckwith • JVM Performance Engineering\n (https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO) Dave Thomas &amp; Andy Hunt • The Pragmatic Programmer\n (https://amzn.to/3azvUy3) Diana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking (https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

For years, \"Caesar” worked as a photographer for the Syrian military, taking pictures of civilians tortured to death and documenting their cases.

Throughout Europe, the families of the victims, supported by international lawyers, activists and Caesar himself, are searching for truth and justice.

In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”\n\n“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice sit down with science writer Dava Sobel, author of a new book on Skłodowska-Curie, to explore the enduring impact of her work on radioactivity.\n\nDiscover how Skłodowska-Curie’s meticulous research led to the isolation of radium and polonium—elements that unlocked the mysteries of radioactivity and laid the foundation for modern physics and chemistry. Learn how her insights paved the way for radioactive dating, which determined the Earth’s age, and her revolutionary contributions to medical science, including the use of radium to treat cancer and the development of mobile X-ray units during World War I.\n\nWe dive into the science behind her two Nobel Prizes—one in physics and one in chemistry—and her perseverance in refining tiny quantities of radioactive material from tons of ore. We also discuss the risks she and her collaborators faced as the dangers of radiation exposure became clear, as well as the scientific advances inspired by her work, including the creation of artificial radioelements for medical applications.\n\nFrom her early experiments to her lab notes—still radioactive today—Skłodowska-Curie’s story is one of unrelenting curiosity and dedication.

Elaine is from Brazil, Yassin is from Tunisia. Camera teams accompany the two for nine months in their new working environments.\n\nGermany’s labor market desperately needs skilled workers - particularly in the medical sector. There’s also a high demand for professional drivers. That’s why many companies are recruiting internationally.\n\nElaine from Brazil worked as head of nursing at the emergency department and intensive care unit of a clinic in São Paulo. She’s married and has an eight-year-old son. She’s long dreamed of living in Europe; São Paulo’s high crime rate is one of the reasons why she’s keen to leave her homeland. \"I can’t travel alone to early or late shifts. I’ll either be raped or robbed,\" she says. In Germany, she’s hoping for security and a better quality of life - something she’d like for her son in particular. Elaine initially goes to Düsseldorf alone; the family plans to join her later. But it won’t be easy for the Brazilian woman. Despite the language barrier, bureaucracy, and the loneliness that comes with being separated from her loved ones, can Elaine start to feel at home in Germany?\nYassin originates from Sousse, a Tunisian coastal city. After leaving fininshing his schooling, he worked there as a truck driver. In Tunisia, the only requirements for this job are a driving license and initial training. Things are different in Germany: Yassin is training as a professional driver for three-and-a-half years at a haulage company in Hesse. Tunisian driver’s licenses aren’t recognized in European countries, so he needs to pass the tests again. Yassin’s trainers describe him as ‘highly motivated and very good’. His final exam is coming up soon. Will the young man, who’s also learning German, make it as a skilled worker on the German labor market? If so, he’d like a small flat where he can invite friends round. His current room, which doesn’t have a kitchen, isn’t suitable - and hospitality is very important in his home country.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.\n\nTogether, they envision a world where better tools and AI lower the barrier to entry for developers, driving innovation and enabling more people to bring their ideas to life.
