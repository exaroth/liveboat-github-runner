Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan‚Äôs national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.\n\nIn response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîthat Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. \n\nIn War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy‚Äôs primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.\n\nUnder Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy‚Äôs long-range scouting capabilities. As \"scout cruisers of the air,\" airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy‚Äôs first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.\n\nIn 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>","contentLength":3348,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/w6vgVTJK_rg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From India to Germany - Creating a new world with good food | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4z76ynr98","date":1737910842,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":15,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Running a restaurant as an Indian woman?

The current solutions to problems such as navigation, traffic/terrain collision avoidance and weight/balance calculations will be demonstrated to the audience, mostly for amusement. More seriously, we will have a look at the legacy that has led to the way things are, and how to improve by applying our programming skills.\n\nWe will look at:\n‚Ä¢ how aviation safety is regulated.\n‚Ä¢ how aeronautical services are provided to flight operators.\n‚Ä¢ how aeronautical navigation is conducted and regulated.\n‚Ä¢ how the weight and balance for a flight is conducted.\n‚Ä¢ the methods by which aircraft and ground coordinate between each other.\n\nWe will see:\n‚Ä¢ some real (and basic) data management problems in aviation, that very obviously threaten safety, then solve them, using programming.\n‚Ä¢ we will see a live demonstration of aeronautical navigation methods, investigate incident reports where lives were lost as a result, and consider how our programming skills can yield improvements, possibly even save lives.\n‚Ä¢ we will conduct a real weight&amp;balance calculation for a flight, then once hilarity inevitably ensues, we will look at the problems that arise by this method, then solve them using data structures and functional programming. Some of these practical problems are obvious, even to a non-aviator, and the predictable incident reports are the end result.\n‚Ä¢ finally, we will have a look at a live demonstration of a software defined radio (SDR), receiving ADS-B transmissions from aircraft (live), an #AHRS implementation and #GNSS receiver using off-the-shelf, low-cost parts. We will look at why these instruments are helpful to aircraft pilots and interact with that device using the #Haskell programming language.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Matthew ‚Ä¢ Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DVZEaw\nAmir Husain ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4ak3BBJ\nMatt Pearson ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/40cm0vS\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#FunctionalProgramming #Aviation #TonyMorris #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.\n\nIs consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it‚Äôs so hard to pin down what makes you ‚Äúyou.‚Äù From Descartes‚Äô ‚Äúbeast machines‚Äù to Darwin‚Äôs revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. \n\nWill AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness‚Äîor even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids‚Äîtiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us‚Äîand why it matters.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Anil Seth\n3:25 - Does Consciousness Even Exist? \n4:55 - Is AI Conscious? \n7:37 - Answering the Consciousness Problem\n15:05 - Why Are You You? \n18:48 - Is Pansychism Real? \n23:58 - Consciousness in the Animal Kingdom\n30:15 - Intelligence v.

This is because Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine has highlighted Europe's and especially Germany's dependence on Russian gas. One possible solution is to increase gas imports from Africa, which already account for around a fifth of the gas used in Europe.\n\nMozambique in southern Africa is expected to become the third largest African exporter of liquefied natural gas. Senegal in West Africa is also seen as a major future gas supplier. \n\nWhat does this development mean for the people of Mozambique and Senegal? Will they actually benefit from gas exports as hoped? Can the utilization of gas reserves create new jobs and help to reduce migration from Senegal to Europe? \n\nSo far, the gas sector in Mozambique has led to conflict rather than prosperity.

She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family‚Äôs fate played no role in her life.\n\nBut when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. \n\nEva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. \n\nHer mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva‚Äôs young life.\n\nDuring her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.\n\nBut a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. \n\nLater in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #holocaustsurvivor \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.\n\nLooking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nTod Golding ‚Ä¢ Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures\n (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) Adam Tornhill ‚Ä¢ Software Design X-Rays\n (https://amzn.to/3DEeEnI) Adam Tornhill ‚Ä¢ Your Code as a Crime Scene\n (https://amzn.to/3FI5E2V) Matthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais ‚Ä¢ Team Topologies\n (http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ) Monica Beckwith ‚Ä¢ JVM Performance Engineering\n (https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO) Dave Thomas &amp; Andy Hunt ‚Ä¢ The Pragmatic Programmer\n (https://amzn.to/3azvUy3) Diana Montalion ‚Ä¢ Learning Systems Thinking (https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
