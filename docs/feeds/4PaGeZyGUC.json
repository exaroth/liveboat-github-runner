At the heart of the film is Ariella, a brilliant young Muslim scholar whose life is upended by the tragic loss of her father. Shattered but determined, she embarks on a bold journey to uncover answers to life's most profound questions: What is love? Can it endure across time and adversity? And how do we rebuild after losing it? Along the way, Ariella is captivated by five astonishing tales from the Islamic tradition ‚Äî stories that redefine love's meaning.\n\nShe delves into an epic poem of star-crossed love as tragic as Romeo and Juliet and unravels the mysteries of the Taj Mahal. She discovers a largely unknown story about how family love shaped Malcolm X and finds empowerment in the remarkable partnership of the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija. Woven through these rich narratives is Ariella‚Äôs own quest to rediscover faith, hope, and the courage to love again. With breathtaking storytelling and universal resonance, Islam‚Äôs Greatest Stories of Love invites viewers on a journey as unforgettable as the stories it unveils, reminding us that love is not just an emotion; it is a force.</article>","contentLength":2008,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/QBBjiDKMI6A?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Andrew Goes to Hobo Convention","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ql9CTlGqmLA","date":1755903694,"author":"Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan","guid":433,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ql9CTlGqmLA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gaza‚Äôs hunger crisis is officially a famine #shorts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6DVbgHcklOs","date":1755897287,"author":"Vox","guid":48,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system ‚Äî the world‚Äôs leading authority on hunger crises ‚Äî has officially determined that there is a famine in Gaza.

A shy, reserved child turned rebellious visionary. He scandalised Vienna with raw, often unsettling depictions of the human body. His work is filled with twisted forms and existential angst, reflecting an obsession with mortality, sexuality, and identity - especially his own. \nHis self-portraits are unlike anything that came before them: emaciated, contorted and confrontational. With sunken eyes and twisted limbs - they were not intended to flatter, but to disturb.

He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality‚Äîa method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting \"residues\" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.\n\nUnlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.\n\nO'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ Residues\n (https://leanpub.com/residuality) Barry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ The Architect's Paradox\n (https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox) Jacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patterns\n (https://amzn.to/3E37lvv) Anne Currie &amp; Jamie Dobson ‚Ä¢ The Cloud Native Attitude\n (https://amzn.to/3R0exeT) Gregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ The Software Architect Elevator\n (https://amzn.to/3F6d2ax) Gregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ Enterprise Integration Patterns, Vol 2 (https://amzn.to/3TNedQ3) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Laughter is both contagious and a social behavior: people laugh 30 times more often in company. The documentary shows how neuroscience and psychology have discovered that humor makes us stronger.\n\nIn London, neuroscientist Sophie Scott has dedicated herself to researching laughter. \"Laughter plays an important role in building and maintaining social relationships. It reduces stress and relaxes us. It is an important behavior to understand,\" she says.  This is why laughter is also interesting for psychology. A research team at the Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt is exploring how humor can help in psychotherapy. Humor strengthens the relationship between therapists and patients, which can actually reduce symptoms.\n\nOthers have also discovered the positive interpersonal effect for themselves: the \"Humor hilft heilen\" (\"humor helps to heal‚Äù) foundation, founded by German doctor and TV presenter Eckart von Hirschhausen, conducts workshops in hospitals, among other places. Humor trainers teach nursing staff how to cope better with the everyday demands of their jobs. It's not about constantly cracking jokes. Rather, it‚Äôs about lightening interactions between nursing staff and patients.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #laughter #laughing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The conflict between Rudolph and Ottokar had been building for five years, representing a final showdown between two powerful rulers who could not coexist. Rudolph's victory marked a turning point in European power dynamics, establishing the Habsburgs as a dominant dynasty with lasting political impact, particularly in Central Europe.

Many of them are now discovering that their past is a lie. International adoptions are at the center of an unprecedented scandal.\n\nThis scandal is far-reaching. It involves children stolen from their mothers during the Pinochet dictatorship, as well as people described as Africa's \"fake orphans‚Äù. The film follows investigative journalists, activists and researchers in South Korea, Sweden, France, Chile, Germany and Switzerland. How was this huge, lucrative market able to flourish? And why does it still exist today?\n\nEven today, women are manipulated, threatened or deceived into giving up their babies - often with the blessing of state authorities. The fraudulent practices persist despite the Hague Convention, which has governed international adoption since 1993. That is because the system is flawed and encourages corruption.\n\nIn many cases, these practices come to light mainly due to pressure from adopted children who have grown into adults. After discovering the dubious conditions of their adoptions, they begin to search for their birth parents and demand explanations. These searches are often easier to conduct these days, thanks to social media, the Internet and the availability of genealogy websites.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #adoption #orphans \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Where does matter come from in the Many-Worlds interpretation? Is the entire universe expanding or just the observable part?\n\nWhat happens if the Milky Way stops spinning? What is the Casimir Force, and why does empty space press metal plates together? If you crunched the asteroid belt into one object, would it even be a planet?
