Female calves later become dairy cows themselves, while male calves are surplus to the dairy industry’s requirements. They’re packed into trucks and suffer in transit on their way to fattening facilities.\n\nCows must calve once a year to produce milk. However, male calves are unwanted, considered waste products of the dairy industry. They’re often sent to fattening farms, mostly outside the EU. A farmer, a scientist and a butcher want to change this. Instead of sending the animals to factory farms where they’re fattened with soy or corn, the bull calves are sent to the pastures and alpine meadows of the Alps.\n \nAlong with a small group of farmers, restaurateurs and retailers, dairy farmer Marcel Renz is trying to change the dairy system in southern Germany. He wants to improve animal welfare, shorten transport distances and produce good quality meat that customers are willing to pay a little more for.\n\nFor people who buy their meat from butcher Hannes Hönegger, this is a positive. The butcher works with small, traditional organic farms that rely on what’s known as dual-purpose breeds, animals not bred solely for performance. Here, cows and calves are suitable for both milk and meat production, just as they were in the past. They feed almost exclusively on what grows in the pastures. In this way, they also contribute to the protection of nature in the Alps - from the Allgäu to South Tyrol.\n \nThomas Zanon's bull calves are among the lucky ones. No long journeys, no fattening with soya or maize. Instead, they graze on his mountain pasture - a small herd that he’s rescued from the dairy industry. Thomas Zanon's main job is as an assistant professor of livestock farming at the University of Bolzano in Italy. Taking all factors into account, he says, milk is by no means inferior to milk substitutes made from oats or soya. The rescued bull calves on his alpine pasture are not only happy animals: They also embody a new approach to sustainable milk production.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, &amp; Gary O’Reilly dive into the mechanics of thinking, how AI got its start, and what deep learning really means with cognitive and computer scientist, Nobel Laureate, and one of the architects of AI, Geoffrey Hinton. \n\nHinton explains the fundamental shift from logic-based rule programming to the biological approach: building systems that learn the way a brain does. Learn about the history of computer science that led to the breakthroughs we have today. We break down the structure of artificial neural networks and the meaning of AI buzzwords like “deep learning” really mean. You’ll learn about the layering of data processing and how the first layer of neurons might detect a simple edge, the second a beak, and the third a bird’s head. \n\nHinton explains the light bulb moment of backpropagation, the mathematical breakthrough using calculus to send force backward to strengthen previous connections. Is this a process we share with neural nets? We discuss whether AI thinks like us and explore why AlphaGo succeeded in beating us at our own game by generating its own data and whether LLMs will hit a ceiling as they run out of human-written text. Can AI reason? What does it mean for something or someone to think?\n\nAs the science turns toward the future, we tackle heavy questions regarding the massive energy demands of data centers and whether AI can reinvent solar technology to save itself. Hinton discusses the \"Volkswagen Effect,\" where a model might strategically underperform to avoid being unplugged. We dive into consciousness to ask if subjective experience is just a byproduct of complex perception and if chatbots already possess it. What are the upsides as well as the downsides? The singularity isn’t imminent yet... but the \"yet\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Kylie Jonasson, Bryan Pfeifer, Anton Couzens, Brad Smith, Jeffdrumseitz, Richard Vaughan, sSHEScience©, Ben Mondoux, Julien Ballez, Tom, Matteo Berlanda, Dr. Cool Young Booger Results Murray, Shawndra Hill, Mike Easter, Charles Shields, Xander-Tony Kehr, Chase Busha, Leah, Justin Harris, Stephen Schultz, Jason West, ImaPerson, Argie Weatherington, Ted Barnett, MD, Lizzie O'Grady, Kimja, Paul Baltatescu, Hanna Cantley, Bill Hoffman, FreddieAbdon, Trish, Muath, Timeless Angel, Dxly, Michael Fuery, Tom Hadrava, Guy Eran, Max Murphy, Cristy Nourash, Donita Buchheit, Kel, Screaming Firehawk, Patricia Churchland, Mikael Stenberg, Dale Duncan, Ghostpacho, Nathan Lehenbauer, James Schaedler, Andrew G, Samuel Sladkovský, Punished Leno, Chris L, George Papura, Miguel Basto, Brittney Starkey, David Rouisse, WTFbro Podcast, Marvin, Jason Driscoll, Yasyoc, Donte Jones, Trevor, Andrew, Jared Harrison, Terence Garrod, TheCrassDragon, Daithon Brown, Perkins, Brendan Gost, Daria Shkrabachenko, Tania Cortes Alonso, JD, Jacob Westman, Lacey Rae Castleberry, Isaac Castrillo, Eric Bouliane, Tim The Secular Humanist, João Sampaio, Aegor, Evan Schreier, Amanda Burris, Allen Arthur, Vikas Jain, Jeroen Wilms, Nathan Schepker, Sverre Moe, Ruth Crisp, Legend Omega, B Dubbz, Jay Youmans, Nite Stalker, Adrian Hungate, Marguerite Nesfield, Michael Engelman, Scott Donner, Diamir Elliott, Warsame Giuled, Kansas Dan, Rey Pierantoni, and Rick Servello for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Geoffrey Hinton\n03:00 - Approaches to Make and Intelligent System\n07:19 - How Artificial Neural Nets Work\n14:12 - Making a Neural Net By Hand\n24:41 - Backpropigation Breakthrough\n33:44 - Why AI Seemed to Arrive So Fast\n34:39 - What is Thinking?\n37:50 - Is AI Better at Learning? \n47:41 - Can We Humanize AI?\n50:58 - Setting Up Guardrails\n54:04 - Is AI Lying to Us? \n58:47 - Will AI Be the End of Us All?\n01:00:51 - Does AI Hallucinate? \n01:04:36 - The Upside\n01:08:13 - Will AI Create More AI? \n01:10:17 - AI Nuclear Winter: Will We Unite?\n01:15:10 - 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics\n01:16:44 - The Price of Replacing All the Jobs\n01:22:50 - Achieving Consciousness\n01:28:37 - The Work to Be Done Before the Singularity\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\n#StarTalk #NeildeGrasseTyson</article>","contentLength":4808,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/l6ZcFa8pybE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Africa - Hotspot of the Cold War | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoGhXmDVv0Y","date":1772298038,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":15,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In the collective memory, the Cold War is the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, one thing is often forgotten: the two superpowers also set their sights on the African continent.\n\nTo this day, the Cold War is remembered as an East-West conflict that was fought in the form of proxy and guerrilla wars in Asia and Latin America. However, one aspect of this confrontation is often forgotten: the United States and the Soviet Union also set their sights on Africa, which became a new arena for their power struggle, against the backdrop of decolonization. \nLeft-wing political forces gained strength in African countries in the 1960s. Moscow seized the opportunity and invested heavily in East African Somalia, for example. The situation was similar in Angola. And Moscow triumphed.\nWith Ronald Reagan as the new president, the United States began preparing its return to the African continent in 1981. The timing was favorable, as communism had been devastating in Africa: the collectivization of agriculture in Ethiopia, for example, led to a famine that cost 500,000 people their lives. \nAs more and more African countries turned away from the Soviet model, Moscow could only stand by and watch. Ultimately, Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms could not prevent the collapse of the USSR in 1991.\nThe end of the East-West conflict offered many countries in Africa the opportunity to take control of their own destiny once again. However, to avoid being exploited and manipulated by world powers once more, the continent had to learn the lessons of the Cold War era.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Opioids have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While headlines often blame illegal drug trafficking by Latin American cartels, the crisis actually began 30 years ago, quite legally, in the United States.  \n\nThe Sackler family, former owners of Purdue Pharma, brought the highly addictive painkiller OxyContin onto the market, unleashing one of the greatest health disasters in US history. Using hundreds of sales reps, they pressured doctors in poorer areas to prescribe the drug. This is considered the first wave of the US opioid crisis.\n\nIn 2025, the Sackler family reached a deal to pay $7.4 billion over 15 years and give up all control of the company. They are also barred from selling opioids in the United States.

But maybe the biggest divide in our politics is the insider vs. outsider divide.\n\nThat’s only gotten more noticeable in recent months, as issues like the Epstein files and artificial intelligence have pitted the elites against everyone else. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is at the center of both of those issues. He wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He brought one of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse survivors to this week's State of the Union address. And he’s coined the term “the Epstein class” — the group of wealthy and connected individuals that he wants to bring to accountability. Even if they’re fellow Democrats.\n\nKhanna represents Silicon Valley in his district, so he has worked with companies like Google and Meta for years. That puts him at the forefront of one of the important political and economic questions of the coming year: Is AI about to put us all out of work?

This number is probably just the tip of the iceberg. In most cases, the crimes are not reported - whether out of shame, fear of the perpetrator, or mistrust of the police and the justice system.\n\nIn the west of the country, in the wealthy and conservative state of Gujarat, the story of 17-year-old Kinjal portrays an India in which rape is apparently considered a \"trivial offense.” \nThree years ago, the young girl, who belongs to the Dalit community - a group considered \"untouchables,” who occupy the lowest social status, at the bottom of the caste system -- was raped by the son of a landowner from a higher caste. \nTo cover up the incident, the rapist's family offered Kinjal's parents land and 100,000 euros - a fortune. But Kinjal's father rejected the compromise, preferring to take the case to court. \nThis rare act of courage was considered an affront by the higher castes. As a sign of his struggle, he decided not to cut his hair again until the perpetrator was convicted. \nKinjal and her family were supported by Manjula Pradeep. The activist, who is also a Dalit, has dedicated her life to defending women who have been raped. Her goal, as yet unattained, is that each victim she helps will be the last. \nFor six months, a camera crew accompanied Kinjal and her family in their search for justice. A glimpse behind the scenes in India, where the violence of the caste system and the weight of tradition determine the lives of hundreds of millions of women.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This has already had an impact on the internal and external security of Western countries. How dependent is Germany on China?\n\nFancy some iced tea? It'll be delivered by drone. A tree falls onto the road? The driverless taxi swerves out of the way. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automation in the megacity of Shenzhen shows how high-tech China is integrating innovation into everyday life. Digitalization is everywhere, in a country where administrative procedures are carried out via mobile phone. \nBut the example of Shenzhen also shows that western countries are in danger of being left behind by China in key technologies such as AI, robotics and electric cars. \nBehind all this advancement lies a great deal of state planning - as well as possible attempts to exert influence. \nThis film shows how China is creating economic and technological dependencies, for example when it comes to so-called \"rare earths\" and \"technology metals.” These are not only indispensable for photovoltaics, wind power and robotics: Many armaments also depend on these raw materials, which are supplied almost exclusively by China.\nChinese manufacturers of batteries and electric cars are also focusing on Hungary as a location to conquer the European market. Factories are being built there, partly to circumvent EU customs duties. The country is actively courting Chinese investment. Within the EU, Hungary repeatedly blocks tougher measures against China. This is putting pressure on Germany's automotive industry.\nThe film explores the question of how dependent Germany is on China and what risks this poses for security and cyber security. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this global power? China competes with the US for leadership in the world, and has long been a security policy challenge for the West. The documentary looks at the two countries’ economic ties, political goals and interrelations -- down to the hyper-local level. Experts from Europe, the US and China provide insights and answers.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #china #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
