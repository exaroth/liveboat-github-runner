But why? Is it due to nutrition? The good weather? Or genetics? Scientists around the world are attempting to solve the mystery.\n\n91-year-old Antonangelo leads a busy life. Every morning, he goes to milk his flock of sheep and later, turns that milk into cheese. \"Work is my life, if I stop, I'll die,‚Äù says Antonangelo. Like many Sardinians in the mountain regions, he and his wife eat almost exclusively local produce. Their recipes for a long life are exercise and healthy food.\n\nGiuseppino is already 100 years old and still manages most of the steep paths in his home village of Villagrande on foot. Is the strenuous hillside location the secret of his longevity? Giuseppino's family takes care of him, but he still lives alone in his flat and is bursting with energy. For him, a positive attitude and a sense of humor are key to a long life.\n\nDespite a good deal of research, the secrets of the Blue Zones still haven‚Äôt been fully explained. But one study from the region does concludes that genetics play an important role in the first half of life. For 91-year-old Carolina, it‚Äôs clear that an intact family is a prerequisite for a long life. She has no intention of going into an old people's home. For her, the most important thing is for a mother to grow old with her children. And traditional food preparation is still one of her favorite pastimes.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #eternallife #italy #sardinia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The film accompanies these men of faith and combat, from their recruitment in Switzerland to their military training in the heart of the Vatican.\n\nMade up of 150 men, this elite corps lives in barracks in the heart of Vatican City. All must be Swiss nationals and devout Catholics. All have sworn to fight to the death to protect their faith and the Holy Father.\n\nThey are heirs to a 500-year-old tradition in which the Pope‚Äôs protection and security were assured by mercenaries from Switzerland.\n\nTrained to wield both halberds and semi-automatic assault rifles, the Swiss Guards form a unique army. But who are they really? What motivates these young boys to join this military and religious corps?

Here‚Äôs why.\n\nEvery spring, millions of people are left coughing, sneezing, and itching their way out of winter. It‚Äôs a sign that nature is blooming back to life, dumping a ton of pollen into the air ‚Äî and, subsequently, our respiratory tracts. Seasonal allergies are undeniably miserable, so it‚Äôs unsurprising that people are looking for miracle cures. One popular idea is to try and microdose pollen with honey.\n\nThe theory goes like this: Pollen causes seasonal allergies. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowering plants to produce honey. So‚Ä¶a small amount of pollen is found in honey, therefore if you eat local honey you can introduce small amounts of pollen to your immune system and help your body gradually build an immunity to it. Boom. Seasonal allergies cured. The only problem? It doesn‚Äôt actually work, but honey does have a ton of other benefits. Watch the video above to learn more.\n\nSupport our work.

Concerns about misinformation, bias, data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and accessibility issues, to name just a few of the concerns, seem to appear everywhere in the media. Who is the latest organization to be breached? Which airport is recovering from an \"incident\" - that wonderfully vague word?\n\nDelivering technology in a responsible manner includes considering all the stakeholders to the solution, not just the obvious ones. The various flavors of architects operating across a solution (perhaps just a small number of people wearing different hats) must attempt to bring the perspectives of other stakeholders into the discussion surrounding features, targets, security requirements, and more. Making this work can be a challenge for teams.\n\nIn this talk, I will first discuss some principles of responsible technology and describe the various ways that making tech responsible generates value for organizations. I will then discuss how various aspects of responsible tech intersect with our good friends the -ilities. Finally, I will describe some techniques that can be used to support teams on their way to building responsible technology.

From minimal type annotations to knowing when to use advanced features, Stefan shares insights on efficient project setup, alternatives to enums, and the strategic use of classes.\n\nThe conversation examines the philosophy behind TypeScript's design while emphasizing a pragmatic approach that focuses on understanding what happens behind the scenes to make better coding decisions. Stefan consistently advocates for simplicity and intentionality when working with TypeScript's powerful but sometimes complex type system.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:30 Intro to the TypeScript Cookbook\n13:42 Project setup: Keeping it simple\n20:14 Use type annotations strategically\n25:44 Avoiding enums in favor of simpler alternatives\n36:12 Classes: When to use them &amp; when to avoid them\n42:44 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nStefan Baumgartner ‚Ä¢ TypeScript Cookbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4iefuM7\nStefan Baumgartner ‚Ä¢ TypeScript in 50 Lessons ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4lEBanw\nAlexandre Portela dos Santos ‚Ä¢ Deno Web Development ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3MZBY7g\nFernando Doglio ‚Ä¢ Introducing Deno ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3KOFBKy\nDan Vanderkam ‚Ä¢ Effective TypeScript ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DBmCib\nNathan Rozentals ‚Ä¢ Mastering TypeScript ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2V4LYUt\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#TypeScript #JavaScript #Deno #Deno2 #Denoland #TypeScriptCookbook #enum #Frontend #WebDevelopment #TodayInTech #SoftwareDesign #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #StefanBaumgartner #PeterKroener #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
