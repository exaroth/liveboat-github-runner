Is our perception of reality just an illusion? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Gary O’Reilly explore the neuroscience behind magic with magician Teller (of Penn &amp; Teller) and neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde.\n\nWe dive into the world of sensory perception, illusions, and the tricks magicians use to exploit the brain’s blind spots. How do our brains construct reality rather than simply perceiving it? Susana breaks down the science behind misdirection and cognitive illusions, revealing how our minds take shortcuts that magicians cleverly manipulate. Why haven’t we evolved to see through magic tricks? What role does survival play in shaping how we perceive the world?\n\nWhat happens when you don’t notice changes right in front of you? We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?\n\nWe also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore. \n\nThanks to our Patrons Jon Alvarez, Peter Dyreng, Joseph Dolan, Chesterfield Browne, Vinkey, Raymot Holmes, Kev, Kamila Kaftol, Biko Duncan, Nathan Hill, Alex Mertz, Erik Berglund Photography, Tricia Lynch, Mathaniel Spomer, Micheal Palmer, John Keltonic, Jack Williams, Eric Christensen, Melissa Palladino, Chris Ormonde, Tom Somers, Ivynelsewhere, Rafael Arenas Jr, Maurice Bakker, Flamigo Toes, Cadu Magarinos Torres, Tanner Simon, and Mike Nagavalli for supporting us this week.\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nThe documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\nIn doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.\nThe documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‘start-up nation’ rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #jerusalem \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?\n\nFilmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. \n\nEmilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.\n\nIn this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. \n\nThe film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #holocaustsurvivor #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.\n\nFingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known. \n\nSources and further reading: \n\n“Unveiling intra-person fingerprint similarity via deep contrastive learning,” by Gabe Guo et al. \nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adi0329\n\n“The developmental basis of fingerprint pattern formation and variation,” by James D.

Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. \n\nSuzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII’s inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. \n\nAnd there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein’s genius.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

Using modern genetic techniques, they’re extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?\n\nFindings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. \n\nIn Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator’s genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. \n\nAnd biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. \n\nHowever, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #mammoth \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

[Originally aired in 2019]\n\nAfter four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.\n\nKing Arthur's Lost Kingdom | Secrets of the Dead\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.
