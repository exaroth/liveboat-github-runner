Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.\n\nBack in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.\nThey also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. \nA nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.\nFor four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.\n\nIf you are suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.\n\nIn this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?\n\nIn short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Building Resilient Distributed Systems ‚Ä¢ https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-resilient-distributed/9781098163532\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Monolith to Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Building Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3dMPbOs\nRonnie Mitra &amp; Irakli Nadareishvili ‚Ä¢ Microservices: Up and Running‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL\nMitra, Nadareishvili, McLarty &amp; Amundsen ‚Ä¢ Microservice Architecture ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3fVNAb0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microservices #JamesLewis #Thoughtworks #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.\n\nThis is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. \n\nBecause shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #shame #emotionaljourney \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She was his most important support as he embarked on a difficult journey: Lend had decided to live not as a woman, but as a trans man.

But Lend stays true to his decision and goes on to open a club in Kosovo for the queer community. \nEkaterina Straijewa is also familiar with the challenges of living in a patriarchal society.

Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?\n\nIn April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in ≈Ωilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.\n\nWhile millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler‚Äôs account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?\n\nBombing Auschwitz | Secrets of the Dead\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  \nYet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? \nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. \n\nIn this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.\n\n*Note* On Occasion this video shows archive footage of captured German submarines flying Allied flags/ensigns\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video: \nhttps://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_W90k5g28 \n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nx.com/I_W_M\ninstagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nfacebook.com/iwm.london\n\nAttributions:\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1980-128-63 / CC-BY-SA 3.0\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1976-127-06A / CC-BY-SA 3.0\nBundesarchiv, Bild 101II-MW-3491-06 / Buchheim, Lothar-G√ºnther / CC-BY-SA 3.0\nVector Map of the World: https://freevectormaps.com/world-maps/WRLD-EPS-01-0001?ref=atr\nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d0cc437e92884a98966ab6b235143573\nhttps://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/bell-atlantic-battle/\nhttps://uboat.net/allies/merchants/losses_year.html\nhttps://uboat.net/fates/losses/chart.htm\nhttps://mapsterman.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/fe88b5e18c6443c7afaf6e32f8432687</article>","contentLength":1749,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/sxguMx5Ph5w?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Seychelles uncovered: The heroin crisis in paradise | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouSSXpNftmQ","date":1738170062,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":10,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Beneath the beauty, the Seychelles harbor a shocking secret: It‚Äôs estimated around 10% of the adult population is addicted to heroin.
