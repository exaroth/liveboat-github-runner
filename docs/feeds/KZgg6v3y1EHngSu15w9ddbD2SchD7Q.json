However, if I understand it correctly, in the end everything thrown at a cluster will be manifests, either directly or created by Helm from Charts or kustomize by merging kustomize manifests.</p> <p>I also stumbled upon helmfile which I thought was pretty neat because it allows you to declaratively define helm charts you want to deploy.</p> <p>However, I&#39;m having some trouble understanding how to get all of this integrated in a way so that I can easily automate it and not have to type 20 commands.</p> <p>I think it&#39;s easier if I try to explain what I want to do: I currently have 3 Control Planes and 2 Worker nodes (Talos) running on my Proxmox server in my Homelab. I also have GitLab running on my NAS. So naturally I&#39;m thinking about using GitOps and want to try ArgoCD.</p> <p>Currently, I&#39;m installing most stuff manually with helmfile + additional manifests and I&#39;m currently in the &quot;bootstrapping&quot; part of the project, e.g. Installing Cilium as CNI, SealedSecrets to handle secrets, configuring storage, etc.</p> <p>Currently the directory structure in my project is something like this:</p> <pre><code>base â”œâ”€â”€ 01-cilium â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ manifests â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ bgp-setup.yaml â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ip-pools.yaml â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ helmfile.yaml â”‚ â””â”€â”€ values.yaml â”œâ”€â”€ 02-sealedsecrets â”‚ â””â”€â”€ controller.yaml â”œâ”€â”€ 03-nfs-storage â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ helmfile.yaml â”‚ â””â”€â”€ values.yaml â”œâ”€â”€ 04-cert-manager â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ... â”œâ”€â”€ 05-traefik â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ... â”œâ”€â”€ 06-argocd â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ... â”‚ ... ... </code></pre> <p>You get the idea.</p> <p>As you can see, there&#39;s some things that have a helmfile, some have manifests only, some have both and I just write in my README how to deploy this, e.g. first <code>helmfile apply -f base/cilium/helmfile.yaml</code>, then <code>kubectl apply -f base/cilium/manifests</code> and so on.</p> <p>On top of that, since I am using SealedSecrets, I need to have the controller running on the Cluster to generate secrets needed for e.g. cert-manager (API-Token for Cloudflare). So that&#39;s a manual step in between so I can push the project to git without it having any unencrypted secrets in it.</p> <p>This feels really clunky and I feel like there should be a much simpler solution. I know I could just write a bash script for this but is this really how the tooling is supposed to be used or am I doing something fundamentally wrong?</p> <p>Also, how do you guys structure your projects and handle stuff like bootstrapping? Do you just use manifests when defining stuff in Code without manual intervention or do you use tools like helmfile? And do you split your git repos between infrastructure projects (deploying core resources and tooling) and application projects?</p> <p>Sorry for asking so many questions but I&#39;m nearly done with getting everything to work but I want to make sure to follow best practices when trying to structure my project and I want to do it now before it gets bigger and restructuring would get annoying...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BrocoLeeOnReddit\"> /u/BrocoLeeOnReddit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hpoekl/deployment_tools_and_gitops_project_structure/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hpoekl/deployment_tools_and_gitops_project_structure/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"What are some good open source Golang websites?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hpnpja/what_are_some_good_open_source_golang_websites/","date":1735566937,"author":"/u/GrandAd5084","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m a beginner in web development and first I did some web development with javascript as backend language but now I am switching to go for backend.</p> <p>I want to know some industry standards to follow while writing go code in web development.</p> <p>Can anyone suggest me some good open source Golang websites code, so I can understand how it is used in web development.</p> <p>Any help is appreciatedðŸ™Œ</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GrandAd5084\"> /u/GrandAd5084 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hpnpja/what_are_some_good_open_source_golang_websites/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hpnpja/what_are_some_good_open_source_golang_websites/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"My implementation of Redis in Golang","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1hpnp9p/my_implementation_of_redis_in_golang/","date":1735566914,"author":"/u/KingBig9811","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am made my own Redis server in Golang including my own RESP and RDB parser.

Whenever there&#39;s an outage due to blocking in PostgreSQL, it may give you essential observability.</p> <p>Recently, I experienced a prod outage caused by a blocked migration.</p> <p>The migration itself was almost instantaneous, but it picks up a lock before it actually runs. That may take a while, but that&#39;s no problem, right? The migration runs a bit later, no worries.</p> <p>That&#39;s when I learned that an ALTER TABLE waiting on a lock, itself also blocks benign work that would otherwise run concurrently. So having your blocked ALTER TABLE can spiral into an application-wide outage quite easily.</p> <p>For example, a SELECT WITH UPDATE can run simultaneously with a SELECT, but not if an ALTER TABLE is executed in between. This is to prevent livelocks. A simple solution is to set a lock_timeout in your migrations, which causes the ALTER to fail early and allow all other work to continue. Then, retry the migration later.</p> <p>I figured this out during the post-mortem analysis, but during the outage, this was hard to infer, even from PostgreSQL&#39;s own slow query log. There&#39;s a number of resources on how to discover this during an outage, but afterwards, all that information is gone.</p> <p>Not with pglocklogger. It inspects PostgreSQL&#39;s in-memory state (using in-memory tables intended for this) and logs the output when it crosses particular thresholds. In an outage, or during post-mortem investigations, this may turn out to be an essential observability tool.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sgielen\"> /u/sgielen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/skybitsnl/pglocklogger\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hpni4e/pglocklogger_realtime_log_of_blocked_processes_in/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Introducing rust_arkitect: architectural rule validation for Rust projects","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hpmvur/introducing_rust_arkitect_architectural_rule/","date":1735564167,"author":"/u/Ap3ir0n91","unread":true,"content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Rustaceans! ðŸ¦€</p> <p>I&#39;m happy to share <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rust_arkitect\">rust_arkitect</a>, a lightweight library for defining and validating architectural rules in Rust projects.</p> <p>I started this project as a way to get my hands dirty with Rust and build something concrete. The idea comes from a similar tool I previously developed in PHP, which brought value by enforcing architectural integrity in large-scale projects. I wanted to see if I could replicate that thing in Rust.</p> <p>Here&#39;s an example:</p> <pre><code>let project = Project::from_relative_path(file!(), &quot;./../src&quot;); let rules = ArchitecturalRules::define() .component(&quot;Application&quot;) .located_at(&quot;crate::application&quot;) .may_depend_on(&amp;[&quot;Domain&quot;]) .component(&quot;Domain&quot;) .located_at(&quot;crate::domain&quot;) .allow_external_dependencies(&amp;[&quot;serde&quot;]) .must_not_depend_on_anything() .finalize(); let result = Arkitect::ensure_that(project).complies_with(rules); assert!(result.is_ok()); </code></pre> <p>Iâ€™d love to hear from anyone who tries it out in a real project.

After spening a couple of days solving some easy problems to get used to the go syntax I felt that I needed to build some sort of project to dig deeper into the language and to face the problems that algorithtm related coding exercises were not providing me.</p> <p>Something that I always wanted to do is to build my own version of git (yep, I am aware that this is quite a common project and that there is lots of implementations on the internet that I could check), in a couple of hours I was able to assemble a quite basic version of the project, some of the basic data structures, branches, checkout... Initially I was trying to mimic the architecture that I use in my php projects (something in the lines of src/service, src/entity) so basically I creted a service package and an entity package to start, but giving it a second look I was quite unhappy about my architecture, as every time that i needed an entity i would need to import the whole entity package, which did not feel nice.</p> <p>I dediced to stop coding an to take some time to research what are the architectural standards for git projects and how devs structure their code. I am well aware after my read that there is no standard in golang, but again, the aim of my project is to get a good grasp of how things should work when building a more complex project.</p> <p>My next attempt was to follow the coding standards recommended at <a href=\"https://github.com/golang-standards\">https://github.com/golang-standards</a> -- so i went from trying to do something like this:</p> <p>.<br/> .<br/> â””â”€â”€ gogit/<br/> â”œâ”€â”€ bin<br/> â”œâ”€â”€ cmd<br/> â”œâ”€â”€ internal/<br/> â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ entity/<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ BranchEntity<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ CommitEntity<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ RepositoryEntity<br/> â”‚ â””â”€â”€ factory/<br/> â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ BranchFactory<br/> â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ RepositoryFactory<br/> â”‚ â””â”€â”€ CommitFactory<br/> â””â”€â”€ tests/<br/> â””â”€â”€ whatever_my_tests_are</p> <p>to something in the lines of this:</p> <p>.<br/> â””â”€â”€ gogit/<br/> â”œâ”€â”€ bin<br/> â”œâ”€â”€ cmd<br/> â”œâ”€â”€ internal/<br/> â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ branch/<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ BranchEntity<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ BranchFactory<br/> â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ commit/<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ CommitEntity<br/> â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ CommitFactory<br/> â”‚ â””â”€â”€ repository/<br/> â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ RepositoryEntity<br/> â”‚ â””â”€â”€ RepositoryFactory<br/> â””â”€â”€ tests/<br/> â””â”€â”€ whatever_my_tests_are</p> <p>I think I am kind of missing out on something in the golang paradigm, not sure whether i should be creating factories anymore as this not OOP nor whether i should have separate classes for my &quot;entities&quot; trying to emulate what would happen in OOP in PHP. On top of that, this architecture has some cyclic dependency problems as, for instance, the CommitFactory in the commit package needs to have access to the branch package, while the branchService neeeds to have access to the commit entity to add a commit to the branch.

Started in 1984 (and inspired partly by a bug in the classic Bourne shell), it's \"the Internet's oldest contest,\" acording to their official social media account on Mastodon. \n\nThe contest enters its \"pending\" state today at 2024-12-29 23:58 UTC &mdash; meaning an opening date for submissions has been officially scheduled (for January 31st) as well as a closing date roughly eight weeks later on April 1st, 2025. That's according to the newly-released (proposed and tentative) rules and guidelines, listing contest goals like \"show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way\" and \"stress C compilers with unusual code.\" And the contest's home page adds an additional goal: \"to have fun with C!\" \n\nExcerpts from the official rules:\n\n\nRule 0 \nJust as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) \n\nRule 1 \nYour submission must be a complete program.... \n\nRule 5 \nYour submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... \n\n\nRule 6 \nI am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); \n while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {\n ha_ha_ha();\n } \n\n \nRule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:\n You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. \n\nThere are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... \n\n\nWe suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.\n \n\nAnd this weekend there was also a second announcement:\n\nAfter a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries. A number of fixes and improvements involve the ability of reasonable modern Unix/Linux systems to be able to compile and even run them. \n\nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader &mdash; and C programmer &mdash; achowe for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status='International+Obfuscated+C+Code+Contest'+Will+Relaunch%2C+Celebrating+40th+Anniversary%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F1730224%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F1730224%2Finternational-obfuscated-c-code-contest-will-relaunch-celebrating-40th-anniversary%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/1730224/international-obfuscated-c-code-contest-will-relaunch-celebrating-40th-anniversary?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Python in 2024: Faster, More Powerful, and More Popular Than Ever","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/0534253/python-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735461240,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"content":"\"Over the course of 2024, Python has proven again and again why it's one of the most popular, useful, and promising programming languages out there,\" writes InfoWorld:\n\nThe latest version of the language pushes the envelope further for speed and power, sheds many of Python's most decrepit elements, and broadens its appeal with developers worldwide. Here's a look back at the year in Python. \n\nIn the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or \"GIL,\" a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue &mdash; enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. \n\nThe no-GIL or \"free-threaded\" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. \nAnother forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.\n \nPython is now more widely used than JavaScript on GitHub (thanks partly to its role in AI and data science code).<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Python+in+2024%3A+Faster%2C+More+Powerful%2C+and+More+Popular+Than+Ever%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0534253%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F29%2F0534253%2Fpython-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/0534253/python-in-2024-faster-more-powerful-and-more-popular-than-ever?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Fish 4.0: The Fish of Theseus","url":"https://fishshell.com/blog/rustport/","date":1735423635,"author":"jdxcode","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://fishshell.com/blog/rustport/\">https://fishshell.com/blog/rustport/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535217\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42535217</a></p>\n<p>Points: 844</p>\n<p># Comments: 187</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: Anki AI Utils","url":"https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub/AnkiAIUtils","date":1735421434,"author":"Ey7NFZ3P0nzAe","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Hi hn, I am nearly at the end of medical school so it is time I publish and \"advertise\" my open source scripts/apps for anki!
