What's more, planets tend to wobble along their rotational axes as they spin, like an off-kilter spinning top in the moments before it topples over. Formally called precession, scientists have long thought that Saturn's wobble rate should match Neptune's because they're probably gravitationally linked. However, data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which studied the ringed planet from 2004 to 2017, revealed that Saturn's precession rate is slightly speedier than Neptune's. \n\nIn 2022, some researchers suggested that the destruction of a hypothetical moon, called Chrysalis, around 160 million years ago may have knocked Saturn out of sync and formed the pieces that became the planet's rings. But this work implied that Chrysalis probably would've crashed into Titan, posing a major problem, study co-author Matija Äuk, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, tells New Scientist's Leah Crane. In that case, Chrysalis' debris couldn't have become the rings, he says. \nSo, Äuk and his colleagues used computer simulations to investigate what would happen if Chrysalis did smack into Titan. If that happened around 400 million years ago, they found, the crash would've wiped away Titan's craters and made its orbit more elliptical. The altered path may have slowly pushed the trajectories of other moons, which then scraped against one another and left chunks of ice and rock that now make up Saturn's rings. The timing seems to align with the rings' estimated age of roughly 100 million years. Additionally, one piece of kicked-up debris may have formed the weird moon Hyperion, which may have subsequently tilted the orbit of the moon Iapetus, according to the analysis. The scenario could also resolve Saturn's unexpected wobble, which is currently \"a little bit too fast,\" Äuk tells Jacopo Prisco at CNN. \n\nThe study has been accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal, and is already available on the preprint server arXiv.","contentLength":2146,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AMD Announces Ryzen AI PRO 400 Series Desktop CPUs For AI-Focused Computing","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ryzen-AI-PRO-400-Desktop-CPUs","date":1772438400,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":729,"unread":true,"content":"<article>AMD is using Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona this week to announce new Ryzen AI PRO 400 Series products, including Ryzen AI PRO 400 desktop processors...</article>","contentLength":162,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lenovo Unveils an Attachable AI Agent 'Companion' for Their Laptops","url":"https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/26/03/02/0530232/lenovo-unveils-an-attachable-ai-agent-companion-for-their-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1772429700,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":183,"unread":true,"content":"As the Mobile World Conference begins in Spain, Lenovo brought a new attachable accessory for their laptops — an AI agent.

You can also interact with it by using emoji. Give it a book emoji, for example, and it will pop on its glasses and sit reading with you while you work... The company wants to sell the Magic Bay accessory later this year — although it doesn't know exactly when, or how much it will cost. \nIt even comes with a timer (for working in Pomodoro-style intervals) — but Lenovo has also created another \"concept\" AI companion that CNET describes as \"a kind of stationary tabletop robot, not dissimilar to the Pixar lamp, but with an orb for a head.\"\nWith a combination of cameras, microphones and projectors, the AI Workmate can undertake a variety of tasks, including helping you generate and display presentations or turn your written work or art into a digital asset... It's robotic head swivelled around and projected the slides onto the wall next to me. \nLenovo created a video to show this \"next-generation AI work companion\" — with animated eyes — \"designed to transform how modern professionals interact with their workspace.\"\n\n It bridges the physical and digital worlds — capturing handwritten notes, recognizing gestures, summarizing tasks, and proactively helping you stay ahead of your day. The moment you sit down, Lenovo AI Workmate greets you, surfaces priority tasks, and keeps your work organized without switching apps or losing context.

You can swap that screen onto the keyboard deck (in place of the keyboard, which can then be used wirelessly), or use it alongside the laptop as a portable monitor, attached via an included cable.... While Lenovo is still working on this device, and it's very much in the concept phase, it feels like one of its best-thought-out prototypes, one likely to make it to store shelves at some point. \n\nAnother \"concept\" laptop is Lenovo's Yoga Book Pro 3D Concept, ofering directional backlight and eye-tracking technology for the illusion of 3D (playing slightly different images to each of your eyes). It offers gesture control for 3D models, two OLED displays, and some magical \"snap-on pads\" which, when laid on the display — make the GUI appear on the screen for a new control menu to \"provide quick-access shortcuts for adjusting lighting, viewing angle, and tone\".","contentLength":3283,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Does a Gas-Guzzler Revival Risk Dead-End Futures for US Automakers?","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/03/02/023210/does-a-gas-guzzler-revival-risk-dead-end-futures-for-us-automakers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1772418840,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":182,"unread":true,"content":"If U.S. automakers turn their backs on electric vehicles, \"their sales outside the U.S. will shrivel,\" warns Bloomberg.

Ford's fortunes are also on the rise, as it's predicting operating profits could grow by as much as 47% this year to $10 billion. Ford's stock has risen nearly 50% over the last 12 months. Under the previous environmental rules, automakers effectively had to sell zero-emission vehicles in growing numbers to offset their gas-guzzlers. When they fell short, they had to buy regulatory credits from EV companies such as Tesla Inc. or face penalties. GM spent $3.5 billion on credits from 2022 to the middle of 2025.

The G-Token launch, now imminent, does not create the ecosystem. It is being built on top of one.</p><p>\\\nThat distinction matters more than it might seem. The crypto sector has a long memory for projects where token issuance preceded utility—and where, once the speculative energy dissipated, the underlying product was found to be empty. Playnance is betting its reputation on reversing that sequence entirely.</p><p>\\\n\\\nThe Be The Boss program is where the numbers become tangible. For a symbolic $1 entry fee, any creator or community operator can spin up a fully branded social gaming platform on PlayW3, Playnance's flagship consumer product. The backend, blockchain settlement, player support, game catalogue, liquidity, is handled entirely by Playnance. The partner, or \"Boss,\" focuses on audience-building. Revenue is split 50/50, paid automatically each day directly to the partner's on-chain wallet. There are no lock-up periods, no token vesting schedules, no promises of future value. The $2 million distributed to date is real money.</p><blockquote><p><em>We designed the token to serve a working ecosystem, not the other way around. The foundation is already in place.</em></p><p>Pini Peter, CEO, Playnance</p></blockquote><p>\\\nThe G-Token, referred to in earlier company materials as \"G Coin\", is not an add-on to this structure. It is the plumbing. Every platform interaction on PlayW3, every game played, every payout processed on Up vs Down and other Playnance products, runs through the token as its settlement and utility layer. Daily earnings distribution to the 2,567 Bosses is denominated and settled in G-Token. Demand for the token is therefore not manufactured by marketing campaigns or speculative listings; it is a direct function of how many people are playing and how many Bosses are operating platforms.</p><p>\\\nThis feedback loop—Playnance's own term, though their language describes it as a \"compounding economic loop\", is the central claim of the G-Token thesis. More Boss platforms bring more users. More users generate more on-chain transactions. More transactions create organic, usage-driven demand for G-Token across gameplay, reward mechanics, and settlement flows. The payout track record then attracts the next wave of Boss operators. The company says the Boss count has more than doubled in recent months, a data point that suggests the loop is already turning.</p><p>\\\nThe architecture behind these numbers is deliberately invisible to end-users. Playnance has built what it calls a non-custodial, on-chain system that sits beneath a Web2-style interface. Users onboard without needing to understand wallets, gas fees, or token mechanics. Every transaction is nonetheless recorded on-chain, providing the transparent, verifiable activity data that underpins the G-Token's claimed utility. At 1.5 million daily transactions, Playnance is operating at a throughput that rivals mid-tier centralised exchanges—an unusual credential for a consumer gaming platform entering its public token phase.</p><p>\\\nThe critical question, as with any token-powered ecosystem, is whether the loop holds under scrutiny. The $2 million in fiat payouts is the most defensible number: it is real money that left a bank account or wallet and arrived in someone else's. The $5.3 million in total revenue is a company-reported figure, unaudited at the time of publication. The 1.5 million daily transactions include all platform activity, not merely financially material events, a metric that, in gaming contexts, warrants examination of what proportion represents genuine user engagement versus automated or incentivised activity. Playnance has not yet published a third-party audit of its on-chain data.</p><p>\\\nWhat the company has published is a track record of paying its partners. In a market where token promises have so frequently substituted for product, $2 million in actual cash distributions is an uncommon form of proof. Whether G-Token becomes the connective tissue of a genuinely scaled consumer blockchain ecosystem or whether the loop stalls as distribution broadens and marginal Boss quality declines, will depend on execution through 2026. The infrastructure, for now, appears real. The test is whether it compounds.</p><p>\\\nDon’t forget to like and share the story!</p>","contentLength":4662,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"America Used Anthropic's AI for Its Attack On Iran, One Day After Banning It","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/03/01/1945208/america-used-anthropics-ai-for-its-attack-on-iran-one-day-after-banning-it?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1772394420,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":177,"unread":true,"content":" Engadget reports:\n\nIn a lengthy post on Truth Social on February 27, President Trump ordered all federal agencies to \"immediately cease all use of Anthropic's technology\" following strong disagreements between the Department of Defense and the AI company.

XRP fell to $1.29 in the sell off. But the smartest XRP price prediction strategy is not choosing between large caps and presales. It is holding both, using XRP for recovery and Pepeto for asymmetric upside no large cap can deliver.</p><h2>XRP price prediction and the best coins to hold in 2026</h2><h3>Pepeto: the asymmetric side of any XRP portfolio</h3><p>Any serious portfolio needs more than a single large cap, and the best XRP price prediction strategy accounts for that by pairing Ripple's steady recovery potential with a six zero entry that could deliver 150x before XRP moves 3x. That is exactly where Pepeto fits, and the capital flowing into this presale tells the story before any headline does.&nbsp;</p><p>The project raised above $7.36M while the rest of the market bled, stages are closing faster than any round before, social mentions tripled in February alone, wallet registrations keep climbing daily, and fake tokens impersonating Pepeto flood decentralized exchanges because scammers only clone what is about to explode.

PepetoSwap is approaching launch as a zero tax cross chain trading engine connecting Ethereum, BSC, and Solana so meme coin traders can move between chains without bleeding fees on every swap. Pepeto Bridge is being built to handle cross blockchain transfers in seconds, removing the friction that forces traders through slow third party services.

The XRPL Foundation patched a critical ledger vulnerability before mainnet, but price action remains muted with lower highs and fading buyer conviction. Bullish forecasts cap XRP between $3.50 and $5.00 by late 2026, representing 3x to 5x upside. That makes XRP a reliable portfolio base, not the whole strategy.</p><h3>Solana price prediction after a brutal February</h3><p>Solana enters March after dropping 31% in February. Weekly DEX volume fell 62% and long term holder accumulation dropped 92% according to Glassnode. Support sits at $80, but a head and shoulders breakdown points toward $59. Spot SOL ETFs pulling in $900 million remain the only bright spot.</p><p>The best XRP price prediction approach in 2026 is pairing large cap recovery with presale asymmetry. XRP gives you 3x to 5x.

You’re no longer responsible for yourself or just a small group, but a large number of people count on your leadership.</p><p>\\\nWhether it’s org restructuring, sudden layoffs, budget cuts, or a natural part of your career growth, handling 2x or 3x more people can be a big challenge. As complexity shoots up, more decisions need to be made, meetings fill up your calendar, chat messages pile up, and 1:1s multiply. The sheer volume of things that demand your attention can feel like an avalanche—you may feel overwhelmed and buried with tasks, messages, and unresolved problems.</p><p>\\\nWithout a proper strategy to manage the increased scale, an increase in responsibilities and expectations can feel unmanageable, diminishing your ability to manage and lead effectively. Every day can feel like drinking from a firehose, making it hard to focus and keep up with the demands of the job. Days end not with a sense of accomplishment, but a feeling of relief as you barely manage to survive and get through the day without completely losing your mind.</p><p>\\\nBut you can’t operate like this forever—without scaling yourself, you’ll eventually feel drained, exhausted, and burnt out. To manage a leadership avalanche without feeling buried, you need to be strategic in your approach.</p><blockquote><p>Leadership at scale—and leadership as you scale—means you’re constantly adapting and evolving. You can’t follow a single style or approach. You’re always leading through transitions. Your company is always changing around you. And this means you’re naturally going to have a very resilient kind of leadership, producing a resilient team and company.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nManaging large teams requires a thoughtful approach to how you prioritize, what you communicate, where you spend your time, and which processes need to be eliminated as they’re no longer serving you well. You need to be flexible in your approach—rigidity can make scaling up harder as you refuse to learn and adapt along the way.</p><p>\\\nHere are the 5 strategies you need to adopt to scale your leadership when tasked with the responsibility to handle a large team:</p><p>When working with a small team, you may be quite involved in day-to-day responsibilities, be part of team discussions, and have regular feedback conversations with them. Over a period of time, this builds a certain expectation around your involvement—when to reach out, when to ask for advice, and when to seek your approval. People get used to a certain way of working, as every interaction with you shapes their thinking.</p><p><em>Instant reply to chat messages</em></p><p><em>Getting your inputs without scheduling a meeting</em></p><p>\\\nThese may be the perks when you’re dealing with a small team. However, as your responsibilities multiply and team size increases, you can’t continue operating in the same way. You can no longer hold  with each team member. You may not get the time to reply to their message as you’re held up with back-to-back meetings. Getting your inputs may require blocking a slot on your calendar, as ad hoc meetings may no longer be a possibility.</p><p>\\\nThese changes, unless communicated verbally, can turn into a source of distress in the team—not getting the attention they’re used to can be quite upsetting and demotivating. You’ve to reset your team’s expectations. You’ve to clarify the changes required to function with a large team. You’ve to make them understand that old ways of operating will no longer be effective.</p><p>\\\nProactively reset their expectations so that the team is attuned to them from the beginning:</p><ol><li>Decide the frequency of 1-1 meetings and schedule them on the calendar.</li><li>Discuss when/how they can reach out to you—clearly distinguishing between issues that require immediate attention vs those that can be delayed.</li><li>Address any concerns they have around your availability and approachability. Seek regular feedback to make it better.</li><li>Communicate any other changes that may impact how they do their work.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Effective scaling depends on believing and living a shared mindset throughout your group, division, or organization.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nAny promises you made earlier to your team—directly or indirectly—may no longer be relevant when dealing with a large team. Breaking them without resetting expectations can lead to decreased morale, frustration, and a lack of trust in the team. As soon as your team size multiplies, discuss changes around your involvement and seek their alignment.</p><p>Communication problems are the biggest source of misery in most organizations. They lead to confusion, misalignment of goals, and even friction between people. Long debates, unnecessary meetings, and issues drag on when people in the team aren’t clear on their goals, or they conflict with priorities across other teams and functions. Time and energy are wasted. Deadlines are missed.  and finger-pointing become the norm.</p><p>\\\nWith a small team, communication problems are still manageable as you can give your attention to every issue that crops up and fight your way through it. However, as your team size multiplies, you can no longer rely on a reactive approach. You’ll not have the bandwidth to attend to every issue that shows up or even resolve it in a timely manner. You may not even know about the problems till they have become a big issue. Reacting to communication problems instead of solving them proactively can turn into a nightmare—as you try to keep up and play a catch-up game.</p><p>\\\nYou can’t avoid all communication problems, but you can definitely minimize the gap by adopting practices that can make communication less painful and more productive for everyone. To do this:</p><ol><li>Seek alignment on priorities and agree on a common measure of success. Success is more likely when everyone works on shared goals.</li><li>Speaking up is important to communicate your ideas and opinions, but it shouldn’t refrain you from also listening to others. Communication isn’t a one-way street. Treat it as a two-sided road.</li><li>Expecting others to register key information by saying it once is a big mistake. Unless you repeat it multiple times, it will not get the time and attention it deserves.</li><li>Good questions have the power to unlock creative thinking and surface out hidden problems. Use every opportunity to explore your curiosity by asking questions.</li><li>Assumptions when not validated can lead to gaps in expectations. Avoid frustration, angst, and anxiety by seeking alignment upfront.</li><li>Blaming, shaming, and complaining do not solve problems. Instead of pointing fingers, identify what caused these communication gaps and how you can avoid them in the future.</li><li> or delaying them makes the situation worse. Step out of your comfort zone and embrace the discomfort.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Over-communicating is the glue that holds a high-performing team together and keeps them focused in the same direction. And, it circles back to clarity. Without good, consistent communication, you don’t have clarity.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nCommunication can be less chaotic in a large team when you’re proactive—clarifying goals, seeking alignment, handling conflicts, and repeating important information often to ensure it doesn’t get missed. Stay on top of your communication game—it can keep you afloat even during the most challenging and stressful times.</p><h3>Multiply your impact through coaching, not instructions.</h3><p>When working with a small team, you may be involved in the nitty-gritty of every project and every task, enabling you to delegate work without losing your sense of control. You may keep a close watch over every task, be involved in how each one is done, and step in at the right time to unblock people and help them make progress on their goals.</p><p>\\\nHowever, as your team scales, you can no longer pay attention to every detail. You can no longer be involved in every issue or each decision. You need to shift from a 10-foot view to a 100-foot view—you have to start assigning not just the task, but a larger scope of work. You have to delegate not just what needs to be done, but also how it must be done.</p><p>\\\nYou can achieve this only by empowering your team—helping them build the essential skills to make decisions, solve problems, navigate complexity, and take accountability for their actions. Trying to micromanage will prevent your team from building the essential skills to learn and grow, limit your team's collective outcome, and cause you to feel stress and burnout. This requires  and a mindset shift from doing to leading others.</p><p>\\\nTo delegate responsibly to a large team:</p><ol><li>Break down your goals and map them to different team members based on their skills or the opportunities they need. Be careful to avoid delegating work that shouldn’t be done at all or a task that only you need to fulfill.</li><li>Delegate the “what” of the problem, support it with “why,” and empower your team to work out the “how.” Stating the expected outcome without the method enables your team to achieve better results.</li><li>Don’t abdicate your team. Support and coach them to make the right decisions and continue making forward progress.</li><li>No process can improve without incorporating the feedback loop. Work with your team to determine how you are doing and what you can do to be better.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Delegate responsibilities, not tasks. In Start, you are delegating tasks, since you’re still involved in all the decision-making. But here in Scale, you’ve got to stop delegating tasks and instead move entire responsibilities to members of your team so that you’re not having to think about every item every day.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTrying to keep a tight control over your team by dictating every task, every decision, and their every move will prevent you from scaling and achieving org goals. Instead, invest in building your team’s skills. Trust them to handle bigger and better responsibilities. Coach them to think and act independently.</p><h3>Reduce clutter and eliminate drag.</h3><p>You may establish a set of processes when working with a small team that enables them to be efficient in working together and getting things done. For example: A stand-up meeting every morning, design discussions with the entire team, conducting pre-mortems for every project, or multiple levels of code reviews.</p><p>\\\nThese processes that worked well with a small team can tremendously slow down a large team—people in the team can waste a lot of time and energy by sticking to old methods of working that no longer keep them efficient. Whether it’s tech processes, collaboration practices, or communication methods, you can’t stick with them just because they worked in the past. You’ve to identify the elements that can create unnecessary drag and reduce your team’s productivity instead of speeding it up.</p><p>\\\nReduce and declutter superfluous processes by following these steps:</p><ol><li>List down the different practices and processes followed by your team.</li><li>Talk to your team members, identify what’s working and what’s adding to the burden. Pay close attention to things that feel unnecessary or impractical with a large team.</li><li>Gather inputs on what they might be missing, which can ease out goals progress and help your team achieve success.</li><li>Introduce small changes at a slow pace. Sudden large disruptions in habitual processes can make team members resistant to change.</li><li>Set up regular feedback discussions to learn, change, and adapt because what works today might be completely irrelevant tomorrow.</li></ol><blockquote><p>A great process isn’t designed; it is evolved. So, the important thing isn’t your process; the important thing is your process for improving your process.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nPay attention to how your team operates on a day-to-day basis—what makes them go full throttle and what adds useless pauses to their momentum. By safeguarding your team’s time and channeling it towards constructive processes, you can reduce the mental clutter and create a positive work environment.</p><h3>Manage your energy, not just your time.</h3><p>When the scope of work is small and interactions limited, you may not feel drained at the end of each day. You may find yourself with plenty of energy to make decisions, solve problems, and guide your team.</p><p>\\\nHowever, as your team size increases, the number of decisions you have to make in a day shoots up. A series of these small decisions scattered throughout the day may seem harmless as they demand only a small fraction of your mental energy, but as the day goes on and you continue to expend from this seemingly reserved pool of energy, your mental capacity to make decisions starts depleting.</p><p>\\\nUnlike physical fatigue, which you can feel and instantly express, the mental fatigue that comes after making multiple decisions is not visible to you. It makes you reckless—you start acting impulsively instead of taking the time to think through the consequences of your decisions. You look for the safest and the easiest option, which is to stick with the status quo, and resist the idea of a change since it’s uncomfortable and demands a lot of energy. </p><p>\\\nA tired mental machinery also makes it hard to process information and separate noise from signal. This may lead to overthinking—the tendency to think too much and move back and forth on ideas without the ability to give them a specific direction. When fatigued, your brain’s regulatory power weakens, causing you to lose control over your emotions. This makes everything around you feel more intense than normal—small mistakes can make you furious, disagreements may cause irritation, and you may react aggressively to things that are not in line with your expectations.</p><p>\\\nNot managing your energy—both mentally and physically—can feel quite suffocating as depleted energy makes it hard to focus and handle the demand and pressure of the job. To conserve your energy and use it well:</p><ol><li>Control the number of decisions you make by choice—declutter and delegate—and put all your energy into getting them right.</li><li>Block a dedicated slot every morning or the previous night to plan what you wish to achieve each day. By not spending mental cycles in deciding every instant what to do next, you can avoid decision fatigue and free up more resources to do the real work.</li><li>Tackle your most challenging task first, one that demands your mental capacity to process information at its best.</li><li>Pay attention to your body—eat and sleep well, incorporate regular breaks into your schedule, exercise, and stick to other healthy routines.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Managing energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of high performance. Great leaders are stewards of organizational energy. They begin by effectively managing their own energy. As leaders, they must mobilize, focus, invest, channel, renew and expand the energy of others.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nTrying to save time without optimizing for energy can be useless, as you may have plenty of time left, but not the energy to be effective. By consciously adopting practices and routines that minimize energy consumption and maximize outcomes, you can achieve the desired scale.</p><ol><li>Your involvement with your team can dramatically change when shifting from a small group to a large one. You can no longer be available and approachable in the same way. To ensure your team understands the changes around your involvement, explicitly reset expectations.</li><li>Doubling down on communication with a large team is a smart strategy to ensure team members are clear on roles, aligned on goals, and there’s less confusion and misunderstanding. Communicate often, repeat information that needs extra attention, and ask questions to seek alignment across teams and reduce gaps in expectations.</li><li>Scaling a large team requires empowering team members to go above and beyond their roles. You have to trust them to handle bigger and better responsibilities. You have to let go of the desire to dictate how everything must be done. Coach, don’t spoon-feed.</li><li>Processes that allow small teams to stay productive can slow down a large team. Instead of sticking to old methods and ways of working, identify what can speed things up and what may get in the way of making progress and moving forward.</li><li>Your energy, just like your time, is a precious resource, which, if not managed well, can get in the way of scaling a large team. Your energy gets depleted with every decision you make, and not paying attention to how and where you spend it can lead to poor choices and terrible decisions. Conserve it for when you need it the most.</li></ol><p>\\\nThis story was previously published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtello.com/how-to-handle-leadership-avalanche-without-feeling-buried/\">here</a>.&nbsp;Follow me on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagivini/?ref=hackernoon.com\">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;or here for more stories.</p>","contentLength":16554,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Let’s explore the best alternatives to Discord","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/01/best-discord-alternatives-age-verification-identity-privacy/","date":1772391601,"author":"Lauren Forristal","guid":328,"unread":true,"content":"<article>With many users feeling uneasy about Discord's new age verification requirement, here are some alternatives that could be worth exploring. </article>","contentLength":139,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Americans Listen to Podcasts More Than Talk Radio Now, Study Shows","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/03/01/054233/americans-listen-to-podcasts-more-than-talk-radio-now-study-shows?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1772390040,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":176,"unread":true,"content":"\"Podcasts have officially overtaken AM/FM talk radio as the more popular medium for spoken-word audio in the United States,\" reports TechCrunch, citing Edison Research's Share of Ear survey:\n\nThe researchers have tracked these statistics over the last decade, and almost always, the percentage of time people spent listening to podcasts increased, while their time with spoken radio broadcasts decreased.

The only consolation is that the birds that are shrinking in numbers the fastest are species — such as the European starling, American crow, grackle and house sparrow — with large enough populations that they aren't yet at risk of going extinct, said study lead author Francois Leroy, also an Ohio State ecologist... \n\nWhen it came to population declines — not the acceleration — the scientists noticed bigger losses further south. When they did a deeper analysis they statistically connected those losses to warmer temperatures from human-caused climate change. \"In regions where temperatures increase the most, we are seeing strongest declines in populations,\" [said study co-author Marta Jarzyna, an ecologist at Ohio State University]. \"On the other hand, the acceleration of those declines, that's mostly driven by agricultural practices.\" The scientists found statistical correlations between speeded-up decline rates and high fertilizer use, high pesticide use and amount of cropland, Leroy said. He said they couldn't say any of those caused the acceleration of losses, but it indicates agriculture in general is a factor. \"The stronger the agriculture, the faster we will lose birds,\" said Leroy... \n\nMcGill University wildlife biologist David Bird, who wasn't part of the study, said it was done well and that its conclusions made sense. With a growing human population, agriculture practices are intensified, more bird habitats are being converted to cropland, modern machinery often grind up nests and eggs and single crop plantings offer less possibilities for birds to find food and nests, said Bird, the editor of Birds of Canada. \"The biggest impact of agricultural intensity though is our war on insects. Numerous recent studies have shown that insect populations in many places throughout the world, including the U.S., have crashed by well over 40 percent,\" Bird said in an email. \"Many of the birds in this new study showing population declines depend heavily on insects for food.\" \n\n\nA 2019 study of the same bird species by Cornell University conservation scientist Kenneth Rosenberg also found that North America had 3 billion fewer birds than in 1970, the article points out.","contentLength":2702,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Google looks to tackle longstanding RCS spam in India — but not alone","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/01/google-looks-to-tackle-longstanding-rcs-spam-in-india-but-not-alone/","date":1772386200,"author":"Jagmeet Singh","guid":327,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Google is integrating carrier-level filtering into RCS in India through a partnership with Airtel to strengthen protections against spam.</article>","contentLength":137,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Soft Bigotry of AI Doom: Because Users Are Just Too Incompetent","url":"https://hackernoon.com/the-soft-bigotry-of-ai-doom-because-users-are-just-too-incompetent?source=rss","date":1772384403,"author":"The_AI_Ethicist","guid":406,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When a new, disruptive technology comes along, fearmongering is never far behind. Writing was said to erode our memory, yet most of you still somehow managed to remember to put underwear on today. Movies and television were supposed to destroy our imaginations, yet the Star Wars and Harry Potter universes are bursting with human imagination, and the sheer volume of their wildly inappropriate fan fiction likewise proves so. Smartphones supposedly eradicated our attention spans, yet… wow, that’s really shiny! I’m sure I don’t need to tell you how disruptive AI is, so naturally, the fearmongering has followed. </p><p>\\\nThe thing is, this particular brand of fearmongering around AI has escalated rather quickly, even in the face of both absurd and hyperbolic arguments, such as AI destroying our critical thinking, collapsing our institutions, and ending our world. Even better, there’s an unspoken thread in this fearmongering that implicates you, the user of AI, as part of this destruction because, apparently, you’re just too damned incompetent.</p><h2><strong>Destruction of Critical Thinking</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/8pmL8ZpO2yTCxdRc1VIehxMAYNQ2-dz939nr.jpeg\" alt=\"\">One of the supposed negative side effects of AI use is the destruction of critical thinking. It seems we are going to be so enamored with AI that we’re going to use it to supplant much of our thinking. No longer will you have to sit and have a think because you can simply have your AI do it for you. Don’t know what’s for dinner? Ask AI! Unsure of the moral implications of capital punishment in a contemporary society? Just ask AI! Is there life after death? AI, my friend. AI.</p><p>\\\nThe argument basically boils down to this: because AI is so ubiquitous, we are going to be unloading so much of our cognitive effort that our critical thinking skills will diminish. It’s the old “use it or lose it” idea. But if the logic is inventions that reduce cognitive effort therefore reduce critical thinking, why didn’t the invention of writing prevent the invention of books, which should have prevented the invention of adding machines, which should have prevented the invention of computers, which should have prevented the invention of AI, whose creation required some of the most arduous collective critical thinking ever undertaken by humanity? </p><p>\\\nIt seems as though the best evidence for this brand of fearmongering is that students who use AI to write their papers are not engaging their critical thinking. Unfortunately, even this claim can’t be supported. What  definitively be said about students using AI to generate their papers is not that their critical thinking skills are degrading, but that they are spending less time writing. Do we need a reminder that writing is not critical thinking? Because if it is, Socrates was an idiot, as he didn’t write. So while writing can certainly be tied to critical thinking, it is not critical thinking itself.</p><p>\\\nThe problem is, many of these arguments use writing as a measure for critical thinking, demonstrating a deep lack of critical thinking. Not that it needs to be said, but two things can be true at once: you can be a good critical thinker and a crap writer. You also don’t have to think critically to write a paper. As a community college instructor, I’ve seen plenty of papers that are bereft of even a grain of critical thinking, but somehow, there were still a bunch of words printed on paper. So my students broke reality in addition to my hopes for them.</p><p>\\\nNo, the best claim that can be made is that many students are spending less time writing, so it’s  there might be a reduction in time spent on critical thinking. But even then, it would be a leap to assume none ever occurs. Am I to understand that students using AI to write papers are not even going to see what the AI wrote and use critical thinking to evaluate the essay? Are they completely unaware that AI hallucinates and makes errors? If all that is the case, it’s not the AI that is preventing critical thinking, now, is it? As surprising as it is, cheating predates AI.</p><p>\\\nWait a minute… I must wholeheartedly apologize. I am absolutely unqualified to think about this critically, as I was in the top 1% of users who sent messages to ChatGPT in 2025. Therefore, I will start acting appropriately: Derrrrrr! Duh, AI good!</p><h2><strong>The Fall of Civic Institutions</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/8pmL8ZpO2yTCxdRc1VIehxMAYNQ2-s8b398k.jpeg\" alt=\"\">Our beloved civic institutions will also fall due to AI. An infamous paper recently made its way around the AI doom circles on this exact topic, <em>How AI Destroys Institutions</em>, and it proposes that this is going to happen through three mechanisms: deteriorating expertise through cognitive offloading, interfering with our decision-making, and isolating humans from each other.</p><p>\\\nMuch like the argument for critical thinking, our professional skills are going to be eroded because of skill offloading from AI. It’s not that we might get worse at that specific thing AI is doing for us; rather, it’s that our professional skills will degrade. This is why I can never use an LLM for classroom content as an English as a second language instructor—my English skills would degrade, I wouldn’t be able to speak English anymore, and I’d be out of a job. Thanks, AI!</p><p>\\\nSo we are to believe that professionals, people who have invested time and money into education and building up careers, are simply going to let important skills get unknowingly chipped away at because of AI? Are lawyers just going to become people who bring Claude into court? So all these people who’ve been highly trained won’t notice they’re not as effective at their jobs as they used to be? Their bosses won’t? The clients who pay for competent services won’t? That’s an extremely dependent and extraordinarily unlikely inverted pyramid made from a lack of self-awareness.</p><p>\\\nSo I guess I won’t notice the degradation of my accountant’s skills when I have to pay six times more in taxes because of their mistakes, and I guess the parents of students won’t notice their children’s grades slipping because the teacher used AI and therefore sucks at teaching. Apparently, AI functions as a global blindfold. It’s fun when you find unintended uses of products!</p><p>\\\nApparently, we’re also just going to have AI make our difficult moral choices for us because we’re just so damned lazy. We’re going to outsource our morality and judgment, all hidden behind an unknowable algorithm. No one will ever hash it out and come to a better agreement because we’re just going to outsource all of that to AI. I know how eager the public is to outsource our ethics, judgment, and morality to AI. Thank goodness there’s never, ever, ever been any pushback on this idea. Like ever. I guess Catholics will ask for repentance through Grok rather than through priests.</p><p>\\\nIn order to collapse our civic institutions, such as education and the justice system, AI will also erode human relationships. Now, it is true that AI will displace some relationships; there’s a good chance the relationship you had with your assistants will be a faint memory when AI replaces them. Honestly, I still haven’t replaced the relationship I had with my ice block delivery man or the horse he rode on. Gosh, I sure do miss the 80s… The 1880s, that is.</p><p>\\\nAnd of course, all of this destruction of human relationships will happen only because of AI. If you thought it started happening with the decline of the monoculture as digital technology ramped up, well, you’re just wrong.</p><p>\\\nAdditionally, people will become isolated because, with AI being so agreeable, there’s less reason to hash stuff out with others in an uncomfortable manner. I get it; people are conflict-averse. That’s why when I turn on the news, I only see stories about rainbows and puppies rather than wars and protests. Humanity is so harmonious!</p><p>\\\nSo yeah, our beloved civic institutions will crumble. Damn you, AI!</p><p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/8pmL8ZpO2yTCxdRc1VIehxMAYNQ2-ygc39fx.jpeg\" alt=\"\">If destroying our society wasn’t bad enough, AI is also going to contribute to the end of the world. The Doomsday Clock by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has been moved to 85 seconds to midnight, in part because of the threat from AI. Biological, nuclear, and informational warfare AI upgrades are pushing us closer than we’ve ever been. And while these threats do actually have some merit, the hyperbolic conclusion still leaves this firmly in the fearmongering camp.</p><p>\\\nThe fear of’ biological warfare is that AI will create a new, dangerous pathogen that people have no defense against. For nuclear warfare, AI’s implementation could mask the decision-making process, increasing the chances of error with a devastating weapon. And for informational warfare, it’s more about sowing chaos through deepfakes and the like.</p><p>\\\nI’ll be the first one to admit that these particular threats do seem a bit more compelling, though I’m still unsure that inching us toward doom is the appropriate conclusion. It is very conceivable that AI could design an extremely dangerous pathogen, but to be fair, we’ve kept plenty of dangerous pathogens for many years, so I’m just going to continue keeping my fingers crossed.</p><p>\\\nFor nuclear warfare, technology in general typically reduces the need for human judgment, and it’s easily argued that it reduces errors from human judgment, so the doom argument seems like a wash at best. As for informational warfare with deepfakes, yeah, that one’s hard to refute. Society is just going to have to figure that one out as we did with other disruptive technologies, though again, contributing to the end of the world seems a bit of a hyperbolic conclusion in the meantime.</p><p>While AI doom slop has always annoyed me, it wasn’t until I sat down and thought about what binds them together, somehow without the help of AI, that I found the thread: humans are too incompetent to use AI responsibly. See, the allure of AI is simply too great for humanity, so naturally, the result is a degradation of our critical thinking, the collapse of our society, and even the destruction of our world.</p><p>\\\nWe must first acknowledge that for any of these doom scenarios to come to fruition, it requires an incredible amount of human failure stacked on human failure stacked on human failure. We’ve already been warned by the doomers who seem immune to AI’s negative effects, yet we’re just not going to do anything to mitigate these potential disasters? Is AI not going to improve in any marked way? The companies that create AI have no incentive not let it destroy the world? I had no idea profits continued to percolate to the afterlife.</p><p>\\\nIt seems parents and educators will simply shrug and accept that their children won’t be very good thinkers. The institutions that prop up our societies apparently can’t do anything in the face of AI to save themselves from ultimate destruction. And the great powers of the world would certainly never do anything to mitigate the risk of world destruction, even though the primary goal of conflict is to not be destroyed, but whatever. Remember, humanity is incompetent. They won’t say it outright, but it’s an implicit requirement in all of these predictions.</p><p>\\\nPlus, while we may be a bit late to the party, historically, we have always recognized the dangers of technology and done our best to minimize the risks. Cars now have seatbelts and airbags, houses now have circuit breakers and grounded outlets, guns have safeties, and even the Three Mile Island, Chornobyl, and Fukushima disasters produced increased nuclear safety. I wonder which magical property of AI makes it resistant to our inevitable improvements.</p><p>\\\nWhat can actually be stated with confidence is that it’s possible we might become too reliant on AI for problem-solving. It’s possible AI will collapse our institutions, but the sheer number of required failures to get there makes it virtually impossible. It’s also possible AI will be participating in the destruction of the planet, but if over 80 years of humanity having nuclear technology is any indication, we’re about 23.95 hours till midnight rather than 85 seconds.</p><p>\\\nTo be clear, none of this means we shouldn’t be cautious; caution with a new disruptive technology should be a requirement. However, we all know the claims being made aren’t advising caution; that’s gone out the window, and they’re predicting disaster.</p><p>\\\nI suppose <em>AI Will Erode Our Critical Thinking</em> is a bit catchier than <em>AI Will Erode Our Critical Thinking If We Simply Do Nothing But Twiddle All Our Thumbs As It Happens</em>. <em>How AI Destroys Institutions</em> is a bold and head-turning title whose cup overflows with hyperbole; <em>AI Has The Possibility To Generate Some Negative Effects On Our Institutions, So Let’s Prepare Ahead Of Time</em> isn’t nearly so bold. <em>AI Is Pushing Us Closer To Global Doom</em> naturally gets many clicks; <em>AI Is A New Tool, So Let’s Proceed Cautiously</em> doesn’t, even if it’s more accurate.</p><p>So, what can be learned from these AI doom stories? Well, it seems they think you’re incompetent and can’t use AI responsibly. They think you’re not going to do anything to mitigate any potential problems from AI. They also think you are simply going to use it in a manner that is ultimately destructive. So really, what we’ve learned is that the soft bigotry of low expectations has come to the world of AI.</p>","contentLength":13267,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Investors spill what they aren’t looking for anymore in AI SaaS companies","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/03/01/investors-spill-what-they-arent-looking-for-anymore-in-ai-saas-companies/","date":1772384400,"author":"Dominic-Madori Davis","guid":326,"unread":true,"content":"<article>TechCrunch spoke with VCs to learn what investors aren't looking for in AI SaaS startups anymore. </article>","contentLength":98,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Collabora Clashes With LibreOffice Over Move To Revive LibreOffice Online","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/26/03/01/042207/collabora-clashes-with-libreoffice-over-move-to-revive-libreoffice-online?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1772382840,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":174,"unread":true,"content":"Slashdot reader darwinmac writes: The Document Foundation (TDF), the organization behind LibreOffice, has decided to bring back its LibreOffice Online project which been inactive since 2022.

There  people who have become millionaires with Bitcoin and crypto investments. Does this mean you will do it, too? Who knows. The reality is more complex than just a little investment, and without a doubt, the crypto market is much more complex now than it was before.</p><p><strong>What we do know, though, is that the stories of these people are real. The stats are real, and their luck or conscious decisions were real</strong>. At this point, when we say “crypto millionaire,” we mean someone who holds (or held in the past) at least one million US dollars in cryptocurrencies, measured by market value. Probably, this amount was initially just a few cents or dollars that grew with time and patience.</p><p>Let’s explore this idea of crypto millionaires and what they did to become one.</p><p>Most cryptocurrencies have public chains, so we have public stats. We know which addresses are richer, and how many. The  estimated that <strong>over 241,700 users worldwide held at least one million dollars in crypto assets at some point during the previous year.</strong> That count included around 145,100 Bitcoin millionaires alone, reflecting Bitcoin’s dominant share of total market value. We can even  in real time with percentages and USD equivalents.</p><p>To include some names, we have  of the top Bitcoin holders in 2026. Besides Satoshi Nakamoto and institutions like Binance, Robinhood, Bitfinex, Tether, and the US government, we also have unknown whales around, with millions and up to billions in BTC holdings.</p><p>Market capitalization and historical prices aren’t a myth, either. We can travel back to 2013, for instance, when the total crypto market cap was around $1.6 billion, and the Bitcoin price was about $135 per coin []. By January 2026, the total market cap surpassed $3 trillion, and the Bitcoin price was at $86k (not to mention previous records of over $126k). That represents increases of 187,400% and up to 93,233%, respectively.</p><p>In other words, if you had bought $1,200 in BTC in 2013 and held on for dear life (HODL) all these years, you would have over one million dollars today.</p><p>Besides stats and anonymous addresses, we have some well-documented cases with names and stories. Likely the younger millionaire here is , who invested in Bitcoin when he was barely 12 years-old. <strong>His grandma gave him $1,000, and he bought BTC at $12 per unit in 2011.</strong> He founded an educational startup with his earnings in 2014 and sold it for 300 BTC in 2015. So, thanks to Bitcoin, he was a millionaire before turning 18.</p><p> is another young investor: he sold some of his toys to invest in Bitcoin when he was just 11 years-old, in 2012. He also bought Ether in 2016 and made himself a millionaire with his crypto trades. Now, also speaking about Ether,  is worth mentioning. He bet his life savings and family house on buying ETH in 2016, when the currency was barely known. The result was $13 million by 2017. He did his research, but of course, doesn’t recommend trying this extremely risky move at home (or with your house).</p><p>The  isn’t exactly a non-anonymous case, but we know that the person behind it’s an early Bitcoin miner. <strong>This charity fund appeared in 2017, revealing plans to donate more than 5,000 BTC to ONGs and some individuals in need.</strong> That was between $55 and $86 million at the time. The organizer, “Pine,” explained that the coins had been acquired quietly years earlier and left untouched while Bitcoin climbed. They had more money than they could ever spend.</p><p>More recently, we can mention the case of two middle-aged . Tommy, James, and several of their family members bought about $8,000 in Shiba Inu (SHIB), a memecoin, before the price exploded in 2021. They ended up making up to $9 million.</p><p>Well, not every crypto millionaire around just bought and sat to wait. Some of them are familiar faces who became wealthy by building infrastructure or companies related to digital assets. <strong>Among them, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance,  for having sold his apartment to buy Bitcoin in 2013.</strong> He launched the exchange in 2017 after a successful Initial Coin Offering (ICO), and now, , he’s the 23rd richest person in the world, with a net worth of around $78.8 billion.</p><p>Jihan Wu is another good example. He co-founded Bitmain in 2013, one of the largest manufacturers of ASIC machines for Bitcoin mining. In 2021, he also launched Bitdeer, which is among the largest Bitcoin miners by computing power. Wu’s net worth has been  at around $2.3 billion.</p><p>Around 2013 as well, when Bitcoin was young and Ethereum didn’t exist yet, <strong>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss turned a famous $65 million legal settlement over Facebook into a huge cryptocurrency presence.</strong> about $11 million to buy Bitcoin when it was roughly $100-120 per coin, giving them 1% of all Bitcoin in existence at the time. Some years later, in 2014, they founded the regulated crypto exchange Gemini. This platform became one of the biggest U.S. exchanges for buying, selling, and storing digital assets.  lists each twin with a net worth of around $3.7 billion as of early 2026, largely from crypto holdings and Gemini’s growth.</p><p>At this point, there are plenty of predictions. The dream of every crypto investor is to see Bitcoin reach one million per coin. If that’s even possible, we don’t know yet. If you can buy a memecoin for a few cents today and see a price explosion of 100,000%+ tomorrow, only luck can tell. All investors mentioned above went in before mainstream awareness, when prices were low, and uncertainty was high. Holding through sharp drops mattered just as much. This is really a mix of research and faith, but we need to remember that cryptocurrencies aren’t just speculation.</p><p><strong>They were created as a way to get rid of middlemen like banks and governments. It’s free money (as in freedom) available for everyone, everywhere, anytime.</strong> If you have your keys, no one else can have your coins. In , we have our own  of addresses (for GBYTE holdings), but what really matters is that no middleman can take your coins away.</p><p>Without miners or “validators,” Obyte offers a multipurpose platform where you can trade and invest your crypto holdings without censorship concerns. At the end of the day, the first real step to becoming a millionaire is having complete control over your assets.</p><p>:::info\nFeatured Vector Image by macrovector / </p>","contentLength":6384,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The HackerNoon Newsletter: The 7 Best Coparenting Apps in 2026 (3/1/2026)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/3-1-2026-newsletter?source=rss","date":1772381046,"author":"Noonification","guid":404,"unread":true,"content":"<p>🪐 What’s happening in tech today, March 1, 2026?</p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/microsoft\">@microsoft</a> [ 27 Min read ] Microsoft’s AutoDev uses AI agents to write, test, and fix code autonomously, hitting 91.5% on HumanEval in Docker. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/microsoft-autodev-the-ai-that-builds-code-on-its-own\">Read More.</a></p><p>By <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/u/solosatoshi\">@solosatoshi</a> [ 7 Min read ] I replaced $1,200/year in cloud subscriptions with one home server.

Please <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose\">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p><p>This release is relatively minor, but as always, even incremental improvements lead to a greater whole. A few of those changes are highlighted in this post, and others may yet fill more niche needs.</p><p>Rust now supports C-string literals () which expand to a nul-byte terminated string in memory of type . This makes it easier to write code interoperating with foreign language interfaces which require nul-terminated strings, with all of the relevant error checking (e.g., lack of interior nul byte) performed at compile time.</p><h3>Support for recursion in </h3><p>Async functions previously could not call themselves due to a compiler limitation. In 1.77, that limitation has been lifted, so recursive calls are permitted so long as they use some form of indirection to avoid an infinite size for the state of the function.</p><p>\\\nThis means that code like this now works:</p><pre><code>async fn fib(n: u32) -&gt; u32 {\n   match n {\n       0 | 1 =&gt; 1,\n       _ =&gt; Box::pin(fib(n-1)).await + Box::pin(fib(n-2)).await\n   }\n}\n</code></pre><p>1.77.0 stabilizes  for struct fields, which provides access to the byte offset of the relevant public field of a struct. This macro is most useful when the offset of a field is required without an existing instance of a type. Implementing such a macro is already possible on stable, but without an instance of the type the implementation would require tricky unsafe code which makes it easy to accidentally introduce undefined behavior.</p><p>\\\nUsers can now access the offset of a public field with <code>offset_of!(StructName, field)</code>. This expands to a  expression with the offset in bytes from the start of the struct.</p><h3>Enable strip in release profiles by default</h3><p>Cargo <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html\">profiles</a> which do not enable <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug\">debuginfo</a> in outputs (e.g., ) will enable  by default.</p><p>\\\nThis is primarily needed because the (precompiled) standard library ships with debuginfo, which means that statically linked results would include the debuginfo from the standard library even if the local compilations didn't explicitly request debuginfo.</p><p>\\\nUsers which do want debuginfo can explicitly enable it with the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug\">debug</a> flag in the relevant Cargo profile.</p><ul><li><code>slice::split_first_chunk_mut</code></li><li><code>slice::split_last_chunk_mut</code></li></ul><p>Many people came together to create Rust 1.77.0.

Sign up for</em><em><a href=\"https://mrkup.org/XvjZS\">Klaxon</a>, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.</em></p><p>\\\nElizabeth Tyree was recently trying to teach her West Texas students about the connections between Emily Dickinson’s letters and her poetry. The project she designed asked students to read Dickinson’s correspondence and compare them to her art, finding examples of how one led to the other. Dickinson’s letters are available for free through The Internet Archive, a nonprofit, digital library that has, among other content, 44 million digitized books and texts at archive.org.</p><p>\\\nBut Tyree and her students couldn’t get to them. Archive.org is blocked by their school district. The federal government <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act\">effectively mandated</a> web filters for schools in 2000 through the Children’s Internet Protection Act. At the time, filters were seen as an important way to keep kids from accessing online porn. <a href=\"http://mrkup.org/block\">A Markup investigation</a> published earlier this month, however, showed these filters have morphed into tools of digital censorship, keeping students in some districts from abortion information, sex ed, and LGBTQ+ resources, including suicide prevention.</p><p>\\\nAfter our investigation published, teachers—including Tyree—took to social media to point out how the web filters frustrate them, too.</p><p>\\\nTyree has been in classrooms for 16 years, teaching students of all ages a mix of English, writing, science, and music. Because the federal government only requires districts to keep students from obscene and harmful content and otherwise leaves them to block whatever else they want, Tyree has had different problems from one district to another. Sometimes tech support will unblock websites she asks to be unblocked, but her request to get her students access to Archive.org was recently denied over a concern that the website also hosts adult content.</p><p>\\\n“It was the only place online that we could get access to Emily Dickinson’s correspondence for free,” Tyree said. “We had to change the entire project.”</p><p>\\\nKaitlyn D’Annibale, an athletic trainer in Washington, D.C. who works with high school athletes, has run into similar hurdles. She needs access to the healthcare website MedBridge both for continuing education and to create home exercise programs for the students she works with, but the site is blocked by her school.</p><p>\\\n“They pay for the membership, but I can’t access the site,” D’Annibale said.</p><p>\\\nWhen she needs to review hospital MRIs to assess students’ playing capacity, she can’t go through the hospital portal to open them because such portals are blocked. Her workaround? Wait until she gets home to look on her own computer.</p><p>\\\nShe recently wanted to look up suicide prevention resources for a student. “Anything I put into Google that was ‘suicidal’ anything got blocked,” D’Annibale said. Eventually she made it to a useful PDF by getting creative with the wording of her search terms.</p><p>\\\nD’Annibale said she has asked for sites to be unblocked in the past but the process is tedious and resolution is short-lived. Sites that the IT department has unblocked for her have reverted to being blocked. She hasn’t been able to figure out why.</p><p>\\\nOne commenter on TikTok said that the process for requesting sites be unblocked in her district requires her to do research about the blocked site (at home, where she can access it), make a case to an administrator, answer follow-up questions, wait for that person to take the request to a board for approval, and then answer more follow-up questions before a decision can be made.</p><p>\\\nAnother described a similar situation: “My district has sites blocked that are actually in the curriculum. We’re supposed to contact our district [department] heads to ask them to get it unblocked. Like they don’t have enough to do. It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>\\\nOther teachers told The Markup about how hard it can be to make lesson plans for substitute teachers, because they aren’t sure which of the sites that are available to them are actually blocked to subs and students. They described indiscriminate blocks to YouTube, Pinterest, and Wikipedia—sites that have useful educational resources mixed in with other content.</p><p>\\\nNancy Willard saw this all coming.</p><p>\\\nBack in 2000, Willard worked at the Center for Advanced Technology in Education at the University of Oregon and submitted testimony to the Children’s Internet Safety Committee, urging Congress not to require filters in the Children’s Internet Protection Act. Reached by phone this week, Willard called the filters a “technical, quick-fix solution” that either don’t work—because students find ways around them—or leave kids unprepared for the real world.</p><p>\\\n“Their world doesn’t have filtering software on their computers at home and their world as adults isn’t going to have filtering software,” Willard said. “So if they haven’t developed the self-control, the ability to assess credibility of information, the ability to focus on the task at hand and not go play [online games], if they haven’t developed that ability, how effective are they going to be as adults?”</p><p>\\\nWillard’s insistence that schools teach students about safe internet use made it into the law.

(\"His grand contribution to the world was a piece of software that told people what to do.\") And the Rationalist movement's Scott Alexander, who \"would probably have a very easy time starting a suicide cult...\"\n\nAlexander's relationship with the AI industry is a strange one. \"In theory, we think they're potentially destroying the world and are evil and we hate them,\" he told me. In practice, though, the entire industry is essentially an outgrowth of his blog's comment section... \"Many of them were specifically thinking, I don't trust anybody else with superintelligence, so I'm going to create it and do it well.\" Somehow, a movement that believes AI is incredibly dangerous and needs to be pursued carefully ended up generating a breakneck artificial arms race. \n\nThere's a fascinating story about teenaged founder Eric Zhu (who only recently turned 18):\n\nClients wanted to take calls during work hours, so he would speak to them from his school bathroom. \"I convinced my counselor that I had prostate issues... I would buy hall passes from drug dealers to get out of class, to have business meetings.\" Soon he was taking Zoom calls with a U.S. senator to discuss tech regulation... Next, he built his own venture-capital fund, managing $20 million. At one point cops raided the bathroom looking for drug dealers while Eric was busy talking with an investor. Eventually, the school got sick of Eric's misuse of the facilities and kicked him out. He moved to San Francisco. \n\nEric made all of this sound incredibly easy. You hang out in some Discord servers, make a few connections with the right people; next thing you know, you're a millionaire... Eric didn't think there was anything particularly special about himself. Why did he, unlike any of his classmates, start a $20 million VC fund? \"I think I was just bored. Honestly, I was really bored.\" Did he think anyone could do what he did? \"Yeah, I think anyone genuinely can.\" \n\nThe article concludes Silicon Valley's investors are rewarding young people with \"agency\". Although \"As far as I could tell, being a highly agentic individual had less to do with actually doing things and more to do with constantly chasing attention online.\" Like X.com user Donald Boat, who successfully baited Sam Altman into buying him a gaming PC in \"a brutally simplified miniature of the entire VC economy.\" (After which \"People were giving him stuff for no reason except that Altman had already done it, and they didn't want to be left out of the trend.\")\n\nShortly before I arrived at the Cheesecake Factory, [Donald Boat] texted to let me know that he'd been drinking all day, so when I met him I thought he was irretrievably wasted. In fact, it turned out, he was just like that all the time... He seemed to have a constant roster of projects on the go. He'd sent me occasional photos of his exploits. He went down to L.A. to see Oasis and ended up in a poker game with a group of weapons manufacturers. \"I made a bunch of jokes about sending all their poker money to China,\" he said, \"and they were not pleased....\" \n\n\"I don't use that computer and I think video games are a waste of time. I spent all the money I made from going viral on Oasis tickets.\" As far as he was concerned, the fact that tech people were tripping over themselves to take part in his stunt just confirmed his generally low impression of them. \"They have too much money and nothing going on...\" Ever since his big viral moment, he'd been suddenly inundated with messages from startup drones who'd decided that his clout might be useful to them. One had offered to fly him out to the French Riviera. \n\nThe author's conclusion? \"It did not seem like a good idea to me that some of the richest people in the world were no longer rewarding people for having any particular skills, but simply for having agency.\"","contentLength":4037,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rebuild Your Life in 180 Days: The No-Excuses Blueprint","url":"https://hackernoon.com/rebuild-your-life-in-180-days-the-no-excuses-blueprint?source=rss","date":1772343004,"author":"BenoitMalige","guid":400,"unread":true,"content":"<p>\\\n\\\nIf you apply what’s on this email to the T, you can rebuild yourself in six months.

(After that department's negotions had failed with Anthropic, they announced they'd stop using Anthropic's technology and threatened to designate it a \"Supply-Chain Risk to National Security\". Then they'd reached a deal for OpenAI's technology — though Altman says it includes OpenAI's own similar prohibitions against using their products for domestic mass surveillance and requiring \"human responsibility\" for the use of force in autonomous weapon systems.) \nAltman said Saturday that enforcing that \"Supply-Chain Risk\" designation on Anthropic \"would be very bad for our industry and our country, and obviously their company. We said [that] to the Department of War before and after. We said that part of the reason we were willing to do this quickly was in the hopes of de-esclation.... We should all care very much about the precedent... To say it very clearly: I think this is a very bad decision from the Department of War and I hope they reverse it. If we take heat for strongly criticizing it, so be it.\" \n\n\nAltman also said that for a long time, OpenAI was planning to do \"non-classified work only,\" but this week found the Department of War \"flexible on what we needed...\"\n\n Sam Altman: The reason for rushing is an attempt to de-escalate the situation. I think the current path things are on is dangerous for Anthropic, healthy competition, and the U.S. We negotiated to make sure similar terms would be offered to all other AI labs. \n\nI know what it's like to feel backed into a corner, and I think it's worth some empathy to the Department of War. They are... a very dedicated group of people with, as I mentioned, an extremely important mission. I cannot imagine doing their work. Our industry tells them \"The technology we are building is going to be the high order bit in geopolitical conflict. China is rushing ahead. You are very behind.\" And then we say \"But we won't help you, and we think you are kind of evil.\" I don't think I'd react great in that situation. I do not believe unelected leaders of private companies should have as much power as our democratically elected government. But I do think we need to help them. \n\n\n\nQuestion: Are you worried at all about the potential for things to go really south during a possible dispute over what's legal or not later on and be deemed a supply chain risk...? \n\n\n\nSam Altman: Yes, I am. If we have to take on that fight we will, but it clearly exposes us to some risk. I am still very hopeful this is going to get resolved, and part of why we wanted to act fast was to help increase the chances of that... \n\n\nQuestion: Why the rush to sign the deal ? Obviously the optics don't look great. \n\n\nSam Altman: It was definitely rushed, and the optics don't look good. We really wanted to de-escalate things, and we thought the deal on offer was good. \nIf we are right and this does lead to a de-escalation between the Department of War and the industry, we will look like geniuses, and a company that took on a lot of pain to do things to help the industry. If not, we will continue to be characterized as as rushed and uncareful. I don't where it's going to land, but I have already seen promising signs. I think a good relationship between the government and the companies developing this technology is critical over the next couple of years... \n\n\n\nQuestion: What was the core difference why you think the Department of War accepted OpenAI but not Anthropic? \n\n\nSam Altman: [...] We believe in a layered approach to safety — building a safety stack, deploying FDEs [embedded Forward Deployed Engineers] and having our safety and alignment researcher involved, deploying via cloud, working directly with the Department of War. Anthropic seemed more focused on specific prohibitions in the contract, rather than citing applicable laws, which we felt comfortable with. We feel that it it's very important to build safe system, and although documents are also important, I'd clearly rather rely on technical safeguards if I only had to pick one... \n\n\n\n\nI think Anthropic may have wanted more operational control than we did... \n\n\n\nQuestion: Were the terms that you accepted the same ones Anthropic rejected? \n\n\nSam Altman: No, we had some different ones. But our terms would now be available to them (and others) if they wanted. \n\n\n\nQuestion: Will you turn off the tool if they violate the rules? \n\n\n\nSam Altman: Yes, we will turn it off in that very unlikely event, but we believe the U.S. government is an institution that does its best to follow law and policy. What we won't do is turn it off because we disagree with a particular (legal military) decision. We trust their authority.\n\n \n\nQuestions were also answered by OpenAI's head of National Security Partnerships (who at one point posted that they'd managed the White House response to the Snowden disclosures and helped write the post-Snowden policies constraining surveillance during the Obama years.) And they stressed that with OpenAI's deal with Department of War, \"We control how we train the models and what types of requests the models refuse.\"\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Are employees allowed to opt out of working on Department of War-related projects? \n\n\nAnswer: We won't ask employees to support Department of War-related projects if they don't want to. \n\n\n\nQuestion: How much is the deal worth? \n\n\nAnswer: It's a few million $, completely inconsequential compared to our $20B+ in revenue, and definitely not worth the cost of a PR blowup. We're doing it because it's the right thing to do for the country, at great cost to ourselves, not because of revenue impact... \n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Can you explicitly state which specific technical safeguard OpenAI has that allowed you to sign what Anthropic called a 'threat to democratic values'? \n\n\nAnswer: We think the deal we made has more guardrails than any previous agreement for classified AI deployments, including Anthropic's. Other AI labs (including Anthropic) have reduced or removed their safety guardrails and relied primarily on usage policies as their primary safeguards in national security deployments. Usage policies, on their own, are not a guarantee of anything. Any responsible deployment of AI in classified environments should involve layered safeguards including a prudent safety stack, limits on deployment architecture, and the direct involvement of AI experts in consequential AI use cases. These are the terms we negotiated in our contract. \n\nThey also detailed OpenAI's position on LinkedIn:\n\nDeployment architecture matters more than contract language. Our contract limits our deployment to cloud API. Autonomous systems require inference at the edge. By limiting our deployment to cloud API, we can ensure that our models cannot be integrated directly into weapons systems, sensors, or other operational hardware... \n\n\n\nInstead of hoping contract language will be enough, our contract allows us to embed forward deployed engineers, commits to giving us visibility into how models are being used, and we have the ability to iterate on safety safeguards over time. If our team sees that our models aren't refusing queries they should, or there's more operational risk than we expected, our contract allows us to make modifications at our discretion. This gives us far more influence over outcomes (and insight into possible abuse) than a static contract provision ever could. \n\n\n\nU.S. law already constrains the worst outcomes. We accepted the \"all lawful uses\" language proposed by the Department, but required them to define the laws that constrained them on surveillance and autonomy directly in the contract. And because laws can change, having this codified in the contract protects against changes in law or policy that we can't anticipate.","contentLength":7923,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"AerynOS 2026.02 Brings More Wayland Compositor Options, Other Improvements","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/AerynOS-2026.02","date":1772327623,"author":"Michael Larabel","guid":722,"unread":true,"content":"<article>AerynOS 2026.02 was released for closing out February as the newest alpha release for this Linux distribution formerly known as Serpent OS.

Based on both the research literature and resources in English and in Chinese, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of deepfake, covering multiple important aspects of this emerging concept, including 1) different definitions, 2) commonly used performance metrics and standards, and 3) deepfake-related datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks. In addition, the paper also reports a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers published in 2020 and 2021, focusing not only on the mentioned aspects, but also on the analysis of key challenges and recommendations. We believe that this paper is the most comprehensive review of deepfake in terms of aspects covered, and the first one covering both the English and Chinese literature and sources.</p><p>: Deepfake, Survey, Definition, Datasets, Benchmarks, Challenges, Competitions, Standards, Performance Metrics.</p><p>Recent advancements in AI and machine learning have increased the capability to produce more realistic media, e.g., video, image, and audio. Especially, state-of-the-art deep learning methods enabled the generation of “deepfakes”, manipulated or synthetic media the realness of which are not easily recognisable by the human eye. Although deepfake is a relatively new phenomenon (having first appeared at the end of 2017), its growth has been remarkable. According to the 2019 and 2020 Deeptrace reports on the state of deepfake [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark139\">2</a>], the number of deepfake videos in the English-speaking internet grew from 7,964 (December 2018) to 14,678 (July 2019) to 85,047 (December 2020), representing a 968% increase from 2018 to 2020.</p><p>In this work, we review existing deepfake-related research ecosystem in terms of various aspects, including performance metrics and standards, datasets, challenges, competitions, and benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers which covers several additional aspects other than the mentioned ones in a systematic manner, such as performance comparison, key challenges, and recommendations.</p><p>Despite being a hugely popular term, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of “deepfake” and the boundary between deepfakes and non-deepfakes is not clear cut. For this survey, we adopt a relatively more inclusive approach to cover all forms of manipulated or synthetic media that are considered deepfakes in a broader sense. We also cover closely related topics including biometrics and multimedia forensics, since deepfakes are often used to launch presentation attacks against biometrics-based authentication systems and detection of deepfakes can be considered part of multimedia forensics. A more detailed discussion on different definitions of “deepfake” is given next.</p><h2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions of the Term Deepfake</h2><p>As its name implies, the term “deepfake” is derived from the combination of “deep” (referring to  (DL)) and “fake”. It is normally used to refer to manipulation of existing media (image, video and/or audio) or generation of new (synthetic) media using DL-based approaches. The most commonly discussed deepfake data are fake face images, fake speech forgeries, and fake videos that combine both fake images and fake speech forgeries. While having “fake” in the word indicates manipulated or synthesised media, there are plenty of benign applications of the deepfake technology, e.g., for entertainment and creative arts. With this respect, another term “deep synthesis” has been proposed as a more neutral-sounding alternative [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark197\">60</a>]. This new term, however, has not been widely adopted.</p><p>In addition to the lack of a universal definition, as mentioned already, the boundary between deepfakes and non-deep fakes is actually not a clear cut. There are at least two important aspects we should consider, one on detection of and the other on creation of deepfakes.</p><p>First, detection of deepfakes often follows very similar approaches to detection of traditional fakes generated without using DL techniques. Advanced detection methods have also started leveraging DL to improve their performance, but they do not necessarily need to know how a target media is created (deep or not). To some extent, one could argue that detecting deepfakes does not involve developing deepfake-specific methods (even though some researchers choose to do so), but a more robust and universal detector that can handle any (deep or not) fake media. This can be seen for two closely related topics: biometrics and multimedia forensics. For biometrics, there is a trend of using deep learning techniques to generate fake biometric signals (e.g., face images and videos) for biometric spoofing or presentation attacks. For multimedia forensics, deepfake-based forgeries have become a new threat to the traditional problem of “forgery detection”. For both topics, detection of biometric spoofing and multimedia forgeries have evolved to consider both deep and non-deep fakes.</p><p>Second, one may argue that the word “deep” in “deepfake” does not necessarily refer to the use of “deep learning”, but any “deep” (i.e., sophisticated) technology that creates a very believable fake media. For instance, Brady [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark146\">9</a>] considered deepfake as audio-visual manipulation using “a spectrum of technical sophistication … and techniques”. They also introduced two new terms,  and , referring to “low level manipulation of audio-visual media created with (easily) accessible software [or no software] to speed, slow, restage or re-contextualise content”. This broader understanding of “deepfake” has also been adopted by law makers for new legislations combating malicious deepfakes. For instance, the following two United States acts define “deepfakes” as follows:</p><ul><li>2018 Malicious Deep Fake Prohibition Act<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark1\">1</a>:</li></ul><p>§1041.(b).(2): “<em>the term ‘deep fake’ means an audiovisual record created or altered in a manner that the record would falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of an individual.</em>”</p><ul><li>2019 DEEP FAKES Accountability Act<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark2\">2</a>:</li></ul><p>§1041.(n).(3): “<em>The term ‘deep fake’ means any video recording, motion-picture film, sound recording, electronic image, or photograph, or any technological representation of speech or conduct substantially derivative thereof—</em></p><p><em>(A)&nbsp; which appears to authentically depict any speech or conduct of a person who did not in fact engage in such speech or conduct; and</em></p><p><em>(B)&nbsp; the production of which was substantially dependent upon technical means, rather than the ability of another person to physically or verbally impersonate such person.</em>”</p><p>As we can see from the above legal definitions of “deepfake”, the use of DL as a technology is not mentioned at all. The focus here is on “authenticity”, “impersonation” and (any) “technical means”.</p><h2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope and Contribution</h2><p>Based on the above discussion on definitions of deepfake, we can see it is not always straightforward or meaningful to differentiate deepfakes from non-deep fakes. In addition, for our focus on performance evaluation and comparison, the boundary between deepfakes and non-deep fakes is even more blurred. This is because DL is just a special (deeper) form of machine learning (ML), and as a result, DL and non-deep ML methods share many common concepts, metrics and procedures.</p><p>Despite the fact that deepfake may be understood in a much broader sense, in this work, we have a sufficiently narrower focus to avoid covering too many topics. We, therefore, decided to define the scope of this survey as follows:</p><ul><li>For metrics and standards, we chose to include all commonly used ones for evaluating general ML methods and those specifically defined for evaluating deepfake creation or detection methods.</li><li>For datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks, we considered those related to fake media covered in the deepfake-related survey papers and those with an explicit mention of the term “deepfake” or a comparable term.</li><li>For the meta-review, we considered only survey papers whose authors explicitly referred to the term “deepfakes” in the meta data (title, abstract and keywords).</li></ul><p>Research papers covered in this survey (i.e., the deepfake-related survey papers) were identified via systematic searches on the scientific databases, Scopus and China Online Journals (COJ)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark4\">3</a>. The following search queries were used to perform the searches on Scopus and COJ, respectively:</p><p>(deepfake* OR deep-fake* OR “deep fake*”) AND (review OR survey OR overview OR systemati* OR SoK)</p><p>(deepfake OR 深度伪造) AND (综述 OR 进展)</p><p>The searches returned 41 survey papers in English and 15 survey papers in Chinese. Out of these papers, eight published in English and four published in Chinese were selected for consideration.</p><p>Deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks were identified via multiple sources: the survey papers selected, research papers from the co-authors’ personal collections, Google Web searches, and manual inspection of websites of major AI-related conferences held in 2020 and 2021 (where such challenges and competitions are routinely organised). The inspected conferences include those listed in the ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) Anthology<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark5\">4</a>, ICCV, CVPR, AAAI, ICML, ICLR, KDD, SIGIR, WWW, and many others. In addition, a comprehensive list of datasets was compiled based on the selected survey papers and the identified challenges, competitions, and benchmarks. Relevant standards were identified mainly via research papers covered in this survey, the co-authors’ personal knowledge, and Google Web searches. For performance metrics, we covered those commonly used based on relevant standards, the survey papers, and the identified challenges, competitions, and benchmarks.</p><p>In this survey, we focus on performance evaluation and comparison of deepfake generation and detection methods. The metrics used for such performance evaluations are at the core of our discussions. In this section, we review the performance metrics that are commonly used to evaluate deepfake generation and detection algorithms. Note that all metrics covered in this section are also commonly used for evaluating performance of similar systems that are not for generating or detecting deepfakes. Therefore, this section can be seen as a very brief tutorial on general performance metrics.</p><p>In the last subsection, we also briefly discuss how the related performance metrics are covered in formal standards. By “formal standards”, we refer to standards defined following a formal procedure, often by one or more established standardisation bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark6\">5</a> and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark7\">6</a>. Note that we consider a broad range of documents defined to be standards by standardisation bodies, e.g., International Telecommunication Union (ITU)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark8\">7</a> recommendations and ISO technical reports (TRs).</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Confusion Matrix</h2><p>Deepfake detection is primarily a binary classification problem. A binary classifier takes an input that is  or  and outputs a binary value denoting it to be  or . For example, a deepfake detection system will take a suspected image as the input that may be  or  and output  or .</p><p>A fundamental tool used in evaluating a binary classifier is the  that summarises the success and failure of the classification model. On one axis are the two  values and on the other axis are the two  values. The classification is  (true positive and true negative) when the actual and the predicted values match. It is  (false positive and false negative) when the actual and predicted values do not match. Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark9\">1</a> shows the confusion matrix for a binary deepfake classifier (detector). The two cells in green, TP (the number of ) and TN (the number of ), indicate correct prediction results, and the two cells in red, FN (the number of ) and FP (the number of ), indicate two different types of errors when making incorrect prediction results.</p><p>\\\nTable 1: Confusion matrix for a binary classifier for detecting deepfake.</p><p>|    | fake (predicted) | real (predicted) |\n|----|----|----|\n| fake (actual) | TP | FN |\n| real (actual) | FP | TN |</p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precision and Recall</h2><p>Based on the four fundamental values introduced in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3.1</a>, i.e., TP, TN, FP and FN, we define two important performance metrics for a binary classifier –  and .</p><p>Precision of a binary classifier is defined as the fraction of  samples among all the . In the confusion matrix, it is the fraction of true samples in the first column. It can be formally defined as Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark10\">1</a>).</p><p>When the “natural” ratio between positive and negative samples is significantly different from the test set, it is often useful to adjust the weight of the false positives, which leads to the  (wP) defined in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark11\">2</a>), where  0 is a weight determined by the ratio between the negative and positive samples.</p><p>Recall of a binary classifier is the fraction of  samples among the  samples, as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark12\">3</a>). In the confusion matrix, it is the fraction of true samples in the first row.</p><p>Let us consider an example binary classifier that predicts if an image from a database containing both deepfake and real (authentic) images is fake or not. Precision of the classifier is the fraction of correctly classified images among all images classified as deepfake. On the other hand, recall is the fraction of deepfake images identified by the classifier, among all deepfake images in the database.</p><h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True and False Positive Rates</h2><p>Focusing on predicted positive samples, we can also define two metrics:  (TPR), also called  (CDR), as the fraction of the predicted positive samples among the actually positive samples and  (FPR), also called  (FAR), as the fraction of the predicted positive samples among the actually negative samples, as shown in Eqs. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark13\">4</a>) and</p><p>(<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark14\">5</a>). In the confusion matrix, TPR is the fraction of predicted positive samples in the first row and FPR is the fraction of predicted positive samples in the second row. Note that TPR is basically a different name for  (Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark12\">3</a>)).</p><h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; True and False Negative Rates</h2><p>Similar to true and false positive rates, we can define two other rates focusing on negative predicted results:  (TNR) indicating the fraction of the predicted negative samples among the actually negative samples, and  (FNR) indicating the fraction of the predicted negative samples among the actually positive samples, as shown in Eqs. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark15\">6</a>) and (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark16\">7</a>).</p><h2>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensitivity and Specificity</h2><p>In some applications of binary classifiers, especially in biology and medicine, the TPR and the TNR are more commonly used, and they are often called  (TPR) and  (TNR). The focus of these two terms is on the two types of correctness of the predicted results. These are less used in deepfake-related research, hence, we will not refer to them in the remainder of this paper.</p><p>Focusing on error rates means that we need to consider the FPR and the FNR. These two rates normally conflict with each other so that reducing one rate normally leads to an increase in the other. Therefore, rather than trying to reduce both error rates at the same time, which is normally impossible, the more realistic task in practical applications is to find the right balance so that they are both below an acceptable threshold.</p><p>In some applications, such as biometrics, people are particularly interested in establishing the so-called  (EER) or  (CER), the point where the FPR and the FNR are equal. The EER/CER is not necessarily a good metric for some applications, especially when the two types of errors are of different levels of importance, e.g., for detecting critical deepfakes (e.g., fake news that can influence how people cast their votes) we can often tolerate more false positives (false alarms) than false negatives (missed alarms).</p><h2>3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy and F-Score</h2><p>In addition to the EER/CER, there are also other metrics that try to reflect both types of errors, in order to give a more balanced indication of the overall performance of a binary classifier. The two most commonly used are  and  (also called ). Both metrics can be defined based on the four fundamental values (TP, TN, FP, and FN).</p><p>Accuracy of a binary classifier is defined as the fraction of  samples (true positives and true negatives) among the total number of samples that have been classified, as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark17\">8</a>).</p><p>The F-score of a binary classifier is actually a family of metrics. Its general form can be described based on a parameter  as defined in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark18\">9</a>).</p><p>The most widely used edition of all F-scores is the so-called , which is effectively the F-score with  = 1. More precisely, it is defined as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark19\">10</a>).</p><h2>3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Area Under Curve</h2><p><strong>Receiver operating characteristic</strong> (ROC) curves are commonly used to measure the performance of binary classifiers that output a score (or probability) of prediction.</p><p>Consider the following. Let  be the set of all test samples and let the output scores  () (for all  ∈ ) lie in the interval [] on the real line. Let  ∈ [] be a prediction threshold for the model, and assume that the classifiers works as follows for all  ∈ :</p><p>\\\nIt is easy to see that, for  = , all the samples will be classified as positive, leading to FN = TN = 0 so TPR = FPR = 1; while for  = , all the samples will be classified as negative, leading to FP = TP = 0 so TPR = FPR = 0. For other threshold values between  and , the values of TPR and FPR will normally be between 0 and 1. By changing  from  to  continuously, we can normally get a continuous curve that describes how the TPR and FPR values change from (0,0) to (1,1) on the 2D plane. This curve is the ROC curve of the binary classifier.</p><p>For a random classifier, assuming that  () distributes uniformly on [] for the test set, we can mathematically derive its ROC curve being the TPR = FPR line, whose area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.5. For a binary classifier that performs better than a random predictor, we can also mathematically prove that its AUC is always higher than 0.5, with 1 being the best possible value. Note that no binary classifier can have an AUC below 0.5, since one can simply flip the prediction result to get a better predictor with an AUC of 1 − AUC. The relationship between the ROC and the AUC is graphically illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark20\">1</a>.</p><p>Another widely used performance metric for binary classifiers that can return a probability score for the predicted label is . For a binary classification with a true label  ∈ {0*,* 1} and an estimated probability  = Pr( = 1), the log loss per sample is the negative log-likelihood of the classifier given the true label, defined as shown in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark21\">12</a>).</p><p>Given a testing set with  samples, the log loss score of a binary classifier can be calculated using Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark22\">13</a>), where  is 1 if the -th sample is true and 0 if false, and ˆ is the predicted probability of  = 1.</p><h2>3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extension to Multi-class Classifiers</h2><p>All metrics that are defined based on the four basic values TP, TN, FP and FN can be easily extended to <strong>multi-class classification</strong> by considering the prediction to be true or false individually with respect to each class. For example, if the system is classifying animals (cats, dogs, horses, lions, tigers, etc.), then a true positive prediction of an image to be of a cat, would simultaneously be true negative predictions for the remaining classes (dogs, horses, lions, tigers, etc.). If an image of a cat is incorrectly predicted to be that of a dog, it would be a false negative with respect to a cat, a false positive with respect to a dog, and a true negative with respect to all other classes.</p><h2>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perceptual Quality Assessment (PQA) Metrics</h2><p>By definition, the main goal of deepfakes is to make it hard or impossible for human consumers (listeners or viewers) to distinguish fake media from real media. Therefore, when evaluating the quality of deepfake media, the quality perceived by human consumers of the media is key. This calls for subjective assessment of the perceptual quality of the deepfake media as the “gold standard”. The most widely used subjective perceptual quality assessment (PQA) metric for audio-visual signals is  (MOS), which has been widely used by the signal processing and multimedia communication communities, including digital TV and other multimedia-related consumer applications. As its name implies, MOS is calculated by averaging the subjective scores given by a number of human judges, normally following a numerical scale between 1 and 5 or between 0 and 100. MOS has been used in some deepfake-related challenges (see Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark113\">5.2</a>) and also for evaluating and comparing the quality (realness/naturalness) of deepfake datasets (see Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark64\">4.6</a>).</p><p>As a general subjective PQA metric, MOS has been standardised by the ITU<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark23\">8</a>. There are also ITU standards defining more specific subjective Video Quality Assessment (VQA) metrics and the standard procedures one should follow to conduct VQA user studies, e.g., ITU-T Recommendation P.910 “Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark24\">9</a>. Note that the ITU standards focus more on traditional perceptual quality, i.e., how good a signal looks or sounds, even if it looks or sounds not real (e.g., too smooth). On the other hand, for deepfakes, the focus is rather different because what matters is the realness and naturalness of the created media, i.e., how real and natural it looks or sounds, even if it is of low quality. To some extent, we can also consider realness and naturalness as a special aspect of perceptual quality.</p><p>One major problem of subjective PQA metrics like MOS is the need to recruit human judges and to have a well-controlled physical testing environment and protocol, which are not easy for many applications. To help reduce the efforts and costs of conducting PQA-related user studies, various objective PQA metrics have been proposed, where the term “objective” refers to the fact that such metrics are human-free, i.e., automatically calculated following a computational algorithm or process. Depending on whether a reference exists, such objective PQA metrics can be largely split into three categories: full-reference (FR) metrics (when the original “perfect-quality” signal is available as the reference), reduced-reference (RR) metrics (when some features of the original “perfect-quality” signal are available as the reference), and no-reference (NR) metrics (when the original signal is unavailable or such an original signal does not exist). For deepfakes, normally NR or RR metrics are more meaningful because the “fake” part of the word means that part of the whole data does not exist in the real world, hence a full reference cannot be obtained. RR metrics are still relevant because deepfakes are often produced for a target’s specific attributes (e.g., face and voice), where the reduced reference will be such attributes. NR metrics will be useful to estimate the realness and naturalness of a deepfake, simulating how a human judge would rate it in a controlled subjective PQA user study.</p><p>PQA is a very active research area and many PQA metrics have been proposed, some of which have been widely used in real-world products and services, e.g.,  (MSE), <strong>peak signal-to-noise ratio</strong> (PSNR) and <strong>structural similarity index measure</strong> (SSIM) for FR PQA of digitalimages and videos defined as in Eqs. (14), (15), and (16), respectively, where X = {xi} n i is the reference (the original signal), Y = {yi} n i is the signal whose visual quality is assessed, n is the number of pixels in X and Y , L is the maximum possible pixel value of X and Y (e.g., 255 for 8-bit gray-scale images), c1 = (k1L) 2 and c2 = (k2L) 2 ) are two stabilising parameters (k1 = 0.01 and k2 = 0.03 by default). For more about PQA metrics for different types of multimedia signals, we refer readers to some relevant surveys [3, 51, 72].</p><h2>3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More about Standards</h2><p>Many of the basic performance metrics described in this section have been widely used by deepfake researchers as de facto standards, e.g., EER, log loss and MOS have been widely used in deepfake-related challenges (see Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>). Also, the combination of precision, recall and F1-score has been widely used to assess performance of binary classifiers. While there have been a number of ITU standards on PQA to date, there does not seem to be many standardisation efforts on the performance metrics for evaluation of binary classifiers. This was the case until at least 2017, when ISO and IEC jointly set up the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark28\">10</a>, a standardisation subcommittee (SC) focusing on AI under ISO/IEC JTC 1<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark29\">11</a>, the joint technical committee for standardising “information technology”.</p><p>One recent effort that ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 made is to produce the ISO/IEC TR 24029-1:2021 “Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Assessment of the robustness of neural networks – Part 1: Overview”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark30\">12</a>, a technical report (TR) that systematically covers many commonly used performance assessment concepts, methods and metrics. Although the technical report has “neural networks” in its title, most performance assessment concepts, methods and metrics included are common ones for all supervised machine learning models.</p><p>In terms of performance metrics, two other ongoing work items of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 that deserve attention are as follows:</p><ul><li>ISO/IEC DTS (Draft Technical Specification) 4213 “Information technology – Artificial Intelligence – Assessment of machine learning classification performance”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark31\">13</a></li><li>ISO/IEC AWI (Approved Work Item) TS (Technical Specifications) 5471 “Artificial intelligence – Quality evaluation guidelines for AI systems”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark32\">14</a></li></ul><p>While the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 was created very recently, another standardisation subcommittee under ISO/IEC JTC1 has a much longer history of nearly 20 years: the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark33\">15</a> that focuses on biometrics-related technology. This standardisation subcommittee is highly relevant for deepfake since deepfake faces can be used to spoof biometrics-based user authentication systems. In this context, the following three standards are of particular relevance:</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021 “Information technology – Biometric performance testing and reporting – Part 1: Principles and framework”</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark34\">16</a>: This standard covers general metrics about evaluating biometric systems. Two major metrics in this context are  (FAR) and  (FRR), which refer to the standard FPR and FNR, respectively. This standard also deprecates the use of single-number metrics including the EER and AUC (which were widely used in biometrics-related research in the past).</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016 “Information technology – Biometric presentation attack detec-tion – Part 1: Framework”</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark36\">17</a>: This standard defines a general framework about <strong>presentation attack detection</strong> (PAD) mechanisms, where the term “” refers to the “<em>presentation of an artefact or of human characteristics to a biometric capture subsystem in a fashion intended to in-terfere with system policy</em>”. It focuses on biometric recognition systems, where a PAD mechanism is a binary classifier trying to predict presentation attacks (also called attack presentations, e.g., fake faces) as positive and bona fide (real) presentations as negative.</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017 “Information technology – Biometric presentation attack detection – Part 3: Testing and reporting”</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark37\">18</a>: This standard defines a number of special performance metrics for evaluating PAD mechanisms standardised in the ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016. Three such metrics look at error rates: <strong>attack presentation classification error rate</strong> (APCER) referring to the standard FPR, <strong>normal/bona fide presentation classification error rate</strong> (NPCER/BPCER) referring to the standard FNR, and <strong>average classification error rate</strong> (ACER) that is defined as the average of the APCER and the NPCER/BPCER. Such metrics have been used in biometrics-related challenges such as Face Anti-spoofing (Presentation Attack Detection) Challenges<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark38\">19</a>. When deepfake images or videos are used to spoof a biometric system, such standardised metrics will become relevant.</p><p>This section provided a comprehensive summary of performance metrics used for evaluating and bench-marking binary classifiers. It is rare that all such metrics are used for a specific application. Instead, one or several are chosen based on specific needs. For a deepfake detection system as a binary classifier, many researchers have chosen to use overall metrics such as accuracy, AUC, EER and log loss, but the combination of precision, recall and F1-score is also common. Some deepfake-related challenges and competitions have introduced their own specific metrics, some of which will be described in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>. The use of different performance metrics can make comparison of different reported results more difficult, so we hope the expected new ISO/IEC standard particularly ISO/IEC 4213 will help.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that, in addition to evaluating performance of deepfake detectors, the introduced performance metrics for evaluating binary classifiers can also be used to evaluate performance of deepfake generation methods by considering how deepfake detectors fail. For instance, organisers of the Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 and 2020 used this approach to benchmark how well voice conversion (VC) systems can generate high-quality fake speech samples.</p><p>Another point we would like to mention is that for deepfake videos there are two levels of performance metrics: those at the frame level (metrics of each frame), and those at the video level (metrics for the whole video). Generally speaking, the latter can be obtained by averaging the former for all frames, potentially following an adaptive weighting scheme, so that more important (key) frames will be counted more.</p><p>In this section, we cover all deepfake-related datasets we identified from the meta-review of deepfake-related survey papers, deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks covered, one online collection of deepfake-related datasets on GitHub<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark39\">20</a>, and the co-authors’ personal collections. Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2</a> shows basic information about these datasets. We explain them in four categories: deepfake image datasets, deepfake video datasets, deepfake audio/speech datasets, and hybrid deepfake datasets (mainly mixed image and video datasets).</p><p>Note that many datasets of real (authentic) media were also used by deepfake researchers for two purposes. First, any detectors would need both fake and real media to demonstrate their performance. Second, real media have also been used to train deepfake generators as the training set. In this section, we include only datasets containing deepfake media, some of which contain both deepfake and real media.</p><p>Some datasets, especially those created for deepfake-related challenges and competitions, have separate subsets for training and evaluation (testing) purposes. The split is necessary for such challenges and competitions, but not very useful for people who just want to use such datasets. Therefore, in this section when introducing such datasets we will ignore that level of details and focus on the total number of data including the number of real and fake samples.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deepfake Image Datasets</h2><p><strong>SwapMe and FaceSwap dataset</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark215\">78</a>]: This dataset contains 4,310 images, including 2,300 real images and 2,010 fake images created using FaceSwap<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark41\">21</a> and the SwapMe iOS app (now discontinued).</p><p><strong>Fake Faces in the Wild (FFW) dataset</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark169\">32</a>]: This dataset contains 131,500 face images, including 78,500 images extracted from 150 videos in the FaceForensics dataset and 53,000 images extracted from 150 fake videos collected from YouTube.</p><p><strong>generated.photos datasets</strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark42\">22</a>: This is a number of commercial datasets provided by the Generated Media, Inc., with up to nearly 2.7 million synthetic face images generated by StyleGAN.

It covers diverse scenes, multiple persons in each scene and rich facial expressions. Different from other deepfake video datasets, WildDeepfake contains only face sequences not the full videos. This makes the dataset more like between an image dataset and a video one. We decided to keep it in the video category since the selection process was still more video-focused.</p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deepfake Audio/Speech Datasets</h2><p>Voice conversion (VC) is a technology that can be used to modify an audio and speech sample so that it appears as if spoken by a different (target) person than the original (source) speaker. Obviously, it can be used to generate deepfake audio/speech samples. The biennial Voice Conversion Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark58\">38</a> that started in 2016 is a major challenge series on VC. Datasets released from this challenge series are very different from other deepfake datasets: the deepfake data is not included in the original dataset created by the organisers of each challenge, but in the participant submissions (which are retargeted/fake utterances produced by VC systems built by participants). The challenge datasets also include the evaluation (listening-based) results of all submissions. Some fake utterances may be produced by DL-based VC systems, so we consider all datasets from this challenge series relevant for our purpose of this survey.</p><p><strong>Voice Conversion Challenge 2016 database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark199\">62</a>]: The original dataset created by the challenge organisers was derived from the DAPS (Device and Produced Speech) Dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark184\">47</a>]. It contains 216 utterances (162 for training and 54 for testing) per speaker from 10 speakers. Participating teams (17) developed their own VC systems for all 25 source-target speaker pairs, and then submitted generated utterances for evaluation. At least six participating teams used DL-related techniques (LSTM, DNN) in their VC systems (see Table 2 of the result analysis paper<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark59\">39</a>), so the submitted utterances can certainly be considered deepfakes.</p><p><strong>Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark181\">44</a>]: The original dataset created by the challenge organisers was also based on the DAPS dataset. It contains 116 utterances (81 for training and 35 for testing) per speaker from 12 speakers in two different tasks (called Hub and Spoke). Participating teams (23 in total, all for Hub and 11 for Spoke) developed their own VC systems for all 16 source-target speaker pairs, and then submitted generated utterances for evaluation. Comparing with the 2016 challenge, more participating teams used DL-related techniques (e.g., WaveNet, LSTM, DNN, CycleGAN, DRM – deep relational models, and ARBM – adaptive restricted Boltzmann machines) in their VC systems.</p><p><strong>Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark207\">70</a>]: This dataset is based on the Effective Multilingual Interaction in Mobile Environments (EMIME) dataset<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark60\">40</a>, a bilingual (Finnish/English, German/English, and Mandarin/English) database. It contains 145 utterances (120 for training and 25 for testing) per speaker from 14 speakers for two different tasks (with 4 × 4 and 4 × 6 source-target speaker pairs, respectively). Participating teams (33 in total, out of which 31 for Task 1 and 28 for Task 2) developed their own VC systems for all source-target speaker pairs, and then submitted generated utterances for evaluation. Comparing with the 2018 challenge, DL-based VC systems were overwhelmingly used by almost all participating teams (WaveNet and WaveGAN among the most used DL-based building blocks).</p><p>A major set of deepfake speech datasets were created for the  (Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing and Countermeasures) Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark61\">41</a> (2015-2021, held biannually). The datasets for the 2019 and 2021 contain speech data that can be considered deepfakes.</p><p><strong>ASVspoof 2019 Challenge database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark204\">67</a>]: This dataset is based on the Voice Cloning Toolkit (VCTK) corpus<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark62\">42</a>, a multi-speaker English speech database captured from 107 speakers (46 males and 61 females). Two attack scenarios were considered: logical access (LA) involving spoofed (synthetic or converted) speech, and physical access (PA) involving replay attacks of previously recorded bona fide recordings). For our purpose in this survey, the LA scenario is more relevant. The LA part of the dataset includes 12,483 bona fide (real) utterances and 108,978 spoofed utterances. Some of the spoofed speech data for the LA scenario were produced using a generative model involving DL-based techniques such as long short-term memory (LSTM)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark63\">43</a>, WaveNet [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark187\">50</a>], WaveRNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark165\">28</a>], WaveCycleGAN2 [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark195\">58</a>]. Note that the challenge organisers did not use the term “deepfake” explicitly, despite the fact that the DL-generated spoofed speech data can be considered as deepfakes.</p><p><strong>ASVspoof 2021 Challenge – Logical Access Database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark151\">14</a>]: This dataset contains bona fide and spoofed speech data for the logical access (LA) task. The challenge is still ongoing and we did not find a detailed paper on the dataset, so cannot include more details other than its size (7.8 GB after compression). Although we did not see details of the generative algorithms used to produce spoofed speech data, we believe similar DL-based algorithms were used like for the 2019 challenge.</p><p><strong>ASVspoof 2021 Challenge – Speech Deepfake Database</strong> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark152\">15</a>]: In 2021, the challenge included an explicitly defined track on deepfake, but the task description suggests that the organisers of the challenge considered a broader definition of the term “deepfake” by looking at spoofing human listeners rather than ASV (Automatic Speaker Verification) systems. The size of the dataset is 34.5 GB after compression.</p><p>Possibly because of the long history and wide participation of the community in the ASVspoof challenges for creating the dedicated datasets, there are very few other deepfake audio/speech datasets. One such dataset was created by a group of researcher from Baidu Research [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark142\">5</a>]. This dataset was created to demonstrate a proposed voice cloning method. It is relatively small, and contains 134 utterances, including 10 real ones, 120 cloned ones, and 4 manipulated ones. Another dataset was created by Google AI and Google News Initiative<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark65\">44</a>, but it was made part of the ASVspoof 2019 dataset.

The datasets were made available to registered participants of the competition only.</p><p> [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark162\">25</a>]: This dataset is named as “a versatile benchmark for comprehensive forgery analysis”. It contains 2,896,062 images and 221,247 videos, including 1,457,861 fake images and 121,617 fake videos. The videos and images cover seven image-level and eight video-level manipulation approaches, 36 different types of perturbations and more mixed perturbations, and a large number of annotation labels (6.3 million classification labels, 2.9 million manipulated area annotations and 221,247 temporal forgery segment labels).

One may argue the automatically generated datasets are fake since they are not produced from real-world scenes.</p><h2>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subjective Quality of Deepfakes in Different Databases</h2><p>As mentioned in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark73\">4.7</a>, subjective quality evaluation is necessary to evaluate the realness, realisticness, and naturalness of deepfake media. While there has been very limited work on this topic, in 2020, Jiang et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark164\">27</a>] conducted a user study on realness of deepfake videos. They recruited 100 professional participants (most of whom are computer vision researchers), who were asked to evaluate the realness of 30 randomly selected videos from 7 deepfake video datasets (DeeperForensics-1.0, UADFV, DeepFake-TIMIT, Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, Deep Fake Detection, and DFDC). Participants were asked to respond to the statement “The video clip looks real.” and gave scores following a five-point Likert scale (1 – clearly disagree, 2 – weakly disagree, 3 – borderline, 4 – weakly agree, 5 – clearly agree).</p><p>Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark72\">3</a> shows the results. Interestingly, we can see a huge difference between the realness levels of different datasets. What is probably quite surprising is that FaceForensics++, one of the most widely used deepfake datasets, has a very low MOS score and less than 9% of participants considered the 30 selected videos as real.</p><p>Table 3: Human-judged subjective quality (realness) of deepfake videos in 7 datasets. The MOS scores were not reported by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark164\">Jiang et al.</a>, but calculated by us based on the raw data shown in Table 3 of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark164\">27</a>].</p><h2>4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion: Datasets</h2><p>Among all deepfake image and video datasets, a significant majority are about face images and videos. This is not surprising since face swapping, face attribution manipulation, and fully synthesised face images are among the hottest topics within deepfake research and real-world applications. We hope more non-face deepfake image and video datasets can be produced to support a broader range of research activities on deepfake.</p><p>The subjective quality results shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark72\">3</a> indicate that it is important to check realness of deep-fake media to support any performance evaluation or comparison. To ensure that the quality evaluation of datasets is fair, transparent and reliable, standard procedures need defining and a common pool of qualified human experts should be used.</p><p>Many authors of deepfake-related datasets attempted to classify such datasets into different generations. Chronologically speaking, we could broadly split such datasets into two generations: before 2019 and since 2019. Typically, datasets created before 2019 are relatively less advanced and smaller, while those created after 2019 tend to be larger, more diverse (i.e., covering more attributes), and of higher quality (i.e., produced by more advanced generative models). This can also be seen from the data in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark72\">3</a>, in which the top two datasets (DeeperForensics-1 and Celeb-DF) fall within the new generation (2020), while others belong to the old generation. In addition to the two generations, a newer generation has also emerged in 2021: a number of very recent datasets started focusing on more realistic deepfakes (i.e., in the wild) or more specified areas of deepfakes (e.g., 10 focusing on multiple faces in the same video, and KoDF focusing on Korean faces). This trend shows that the deepfake research community has grown significantly in the past few years so that narrower topics have also started gaining attention and interest from some researchers.</p><p>This section reviews initiatives aiming to advance the state-of-the-art of detection and generation of synthetic or manipulated media (such as video, image and audio) via competitions or challenges open to the public, and ongoing benchmarks tackling specific problems.</p><p>The Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark75\">51</a> was an initiative promoted by an AI and Media Steering Committee<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark76\">52</a>, including BBC, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and New York Times, and some universities around the world including the University of Oxford. The competition remained open from 5 September 2019 till 31 March 2020, and involved 3 stages. At first, the DFDC preview dataset was released. At a later stage, the DFDC full dataset was also made available to the 2,114 participants of the competition incorporating face and audio swap techniques for generation of deepfake content. At the final stage, the submitted models were evaluated using a test dataset (referred to as the “black box dataset”) of 10,000 videos which included  deepfake videos. The best performance on the black box dataset had an accuracy of 65.18%, according to the released results [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark159\">22</a>]. Submissions were ranked<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark78\">53</a> according to the overall log loss score, as defined in Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark22\">13</a>). All top five ranked models (the winner had the lowest overall log loss) are available on GitHub. Results indicate how challenging the detection of deepfake is since the best accuracy was low and “<em>many submissions were simply random</em>”, according to Dolhansky et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark156\">19</a>]. Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark77\">2</a> shows a screenshot of the leaderboard with the five finalists. The first top ranked model used MTCNN (Multi-tasked Cascaded Convolutional Network), the second used WS-DAN (Weakly Supervised Data Augumentation Network), and the third used the EfficientNetB7 architecture. Meta compiling the common themes observed in the winning models, they were: clever augmentations, architectures, and absence of forensics methods. Moving forward, they called for “<em>solutions that go beyond analysing images and video. Considering context, provenance, and other signals may be the way to improve deepfake detection models</em>”.</p><p>\\\nThe Automatic Speaker Verification Spoofing And Countermeasures Challenge Workshop (ASVspoof)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark79\">54</a> has been running biennially since 2015. This competition is organised by an international consortium that includes Inria and EURECOM (France), University of Eastern Finland, National Institute of Informatics (Japan), and Institute for Infocomm Research (Singapore). This year the ASVspoof challenge includes, for the first time, a sub-challenge focused on  where the envisioned use case is an adversary trying to fool a human listener. The metric used for evaluating performance of submitted solutions (i.e., classifiers) is EER. Four baseline solutions<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark80\">55</a> (also called “countermeasures”), each using a different technique, were made available to participants with their corresponding EER metric values. The ASVspoof 2021 Speech Deepfake Database containing audio recordings with original and spoofed utterances has also been made available. The competition involves three phases<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark81\">56</a>: a progress phase, an evaluation phase and a post-evaluation phase; it is unclear how teams move from one phase to the next. More information about the 2021 competition is available in the published evaluation plan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark150\">13</a>]. The organisers of the competition noted that they opted for the EER as the performance evaluation met-ric for countermeasures submitted to the speech deepfake task for legacy reasons. They acknowledged, however, that “<em>EER reporting is deprecated</em> ” by the ISO/IEC 19795-1:2021<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark82\">57</a> standard. Despite the fact that only the 2021 ASVspoof competition contained a track explicitly related to deepfake, some data in the ASVspoof 2019 dataset (Logical Access task) used for the 2019 competition was generated using DL-based algorithms as mentioned in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>. We expect that this also holds for the ASVspoof 2021 dataset (Logical Access task). The ASVspoof 2019 competition used the EER as secondary metric; the primary performance metric used was the tandem detection cost function (t-DCF) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark200\">63</a>]. According to its evaluation plan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark206\">69</a>], t-DCF assesses the performance of the whole tandem system whereby “<em>a CM [countermeasure] serves as a ‘gate’ to determine whether a given speech input originates from a bona fide (genuine) user, before passing it the main biometric verifier (the ASV system)</em>”. It is calculated according to Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark83\">17</a>), where  cm () and  cm() are, respectively, “<em>the miss rate and the false alarm rate of the CM system at threshold s</em>”.</p><p>For further information about Eq.

Its first two editions were held at the 2019 and 2020 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2020), respectively. Its third edition was moved to be co-located with the 2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2021). This competition series was organised by a group of researchers from academia and industry in China, Mexico, Spain, Finland and the US. The 2021 competition was focused on 3D high-fidelity mask attacks, and followed a 2-phased<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark88\">61</a> process. The first phase is the “development phase”; it started in April 2021 when the CASIA-SURF HiFiMask dataset<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark89\">62</a> was released to participants. The second phase is the “final ranking phase” (June 2021), when the competition ended. The competition adopted the following performance metrics for evaluation<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark90\">63</a> of the solutions submitted: attack presentation classification error rate (APCER), normal/bona fide presentation classification error rate (NPCER/BPCER), and average classification error rate (ACER), in accordance with the ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark91\">64</a> standard. Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark84\">3</a> provides the leaderboard for the top three solutions.</p><p>\\\nThe FaceForensics Benchmark<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark92\">65</a> is an ongoing automated benchmark for detection of face manipulation. The organisers of the benchmark made the FaceForensics++ dataset available for training. Manipulated videos (4,000 in total) were created using four techniques, i.e., two computer graphics-based approaches (Face2Face and FaceSwap) and two learning-based approaches (DeepFakes and Neural Textures). The deepfakes videos were generated using a slightly modified version of FaceSwap<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark93\">66</a>, and the Neural Textures videos were created using the approach proposed by Thies et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark198\">61</a>]. The benchmark test dataset is created from the collection of 1,000 images randomly selected from either the manipulation methods or the original videos [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark193\">56</a>]. Participants have to submit results to the benchmark, rather then code like other competitions; this is illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark94\">4a</a>. The outcome of a submission is illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark94\">4b</a>, where the scores are a measure of accuracy (Eq.

It has been organised annually<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark97\">68</a> starting from 2017 under the name of DARPA MFC. In 2020, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated the  as a new evaluation platform, based on their previous experiences with the DARPA MFC series, to make the participation more convenient for all researchers. In OpenMFC 2020, two deepfake-related tasks were included for the first time: Image GAN Manipulation Detection (IGMD) and Video GAN Manipulation Detection (VGMD). The organisers provided an image evaluation dataset for the IGMD task, containing 1,000 images from over 200 image journals<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark98\">69</a>, and a video evaluation dataset for the VGMD task, including over 100 test videos. Furthermore, they provided the datasets<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark99\">70</a> used in the previous MFC challenges as development datasets. The challenge is composed of two main phases for development and evaluation, respectively, and a pre-challenge phase for quality control testing. For evaluation of submissions, AUC-ROC is used as the primary metric. Furthermore, CDR@FAR, where CDR refers to correct detection rate or TPR (Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark13\">4</a>)) and FAR refers to false alarm rate or FPR (Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark14\">5</a>)), is also used as a metric [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark186\">49</a>]. The DeeperForensics Challenge 2020<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark100\">71</a> is a deepfake face detection challenge held at the 2020 ECCV</p><p>SenseHuman Workshop<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark101\">72</a>. The challenge used the DeeperForensics1.0 dataset.</p><p>The organisers provided a hidden test dataset to better simulate real-world scenarios. The challenge involved two phases: the “development phase” that started in August 2020 allowing 100 successful sub-missions, and the “final test phase” that started in October 2020 allowing 2 successful submissions until the end of the month. The submissions were evaluated using the binary cross-entropy loss (BCELoss) metric, calculated according to Eq. (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark95\">18</a>), where  is the number of videos in the hidden test set,  is the ground truth label of video  (fake:1, real:0), and () is the predicted probability that video  is fake.</p><p>Results<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark102\">73</a> of the competition were discussed by Jiang et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark163\">26</a>]. The top solution used three models, i.e., EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B2, for classification. The second top used EfficientNet-B5 for both an image-based model and a video-based model. The third ranked solution used a 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN).</p><p>\\\nThe Face Forgery Analysis Challenge 2021<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark104\">74</a> is a competition hosted at the 2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2021). It is organised by researchers from a number of organisations in China including universities and SenseTime Research (the research arm of SenseTime<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark105\">75</a>, one of the major AI “unicorns” in China). The challenge aims to advance the state-of-the-art in detection of photo-realistic manipulation of images and videos. Participants are able to use a large annotated face dataset (i.e., the ForgeryNet dataset) that was obtained by applying a number of techniques for manipulation (15) and perturbation (36) to train their solutions. The phases comprise of Forgery Image Analysis, Forgery Video Analysis, Forgery Video Temporal Localization phases, and the final phase (i.e., “private test”) where participants’ models will be tested against an unseen dataset. The following metrics will be used [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark162\">25</a>]: AUC, average precision (AP) at some “temporal Intersection over Union” (AP@tIoU) compared to a threshold  ∈ [0*.,* 0*.*95], and average recall (AR) at  (AR@) where  is the top  labels returned for multi-class classifiers.</p><p>The 2020 CelebA-Spoof Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark106\">76</a> was hosted at the 16 European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020). The challenge ran between August and October 2020, and aimed to advance the state-of-the-art in detecting “<em>whether a presented face is live or spoof</em> ” [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark213\">76</a>]. The organisers made the face CelebA-Spoof dataset available for the competition containing rich annotation across a range of attributes. The competition only had one phase where participants submitted their solutions to be evaluated against a test dataset; the spoof class was considered as “positive” and the live class as “negative”. Metric TPR@FPR was used and collected at three points where the TPR when FPR = 104 determined the final ranking. The top three finalists (see Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark103\">5</a>) used deep learning models ResNet, EfficientNet-B7, and a novel architecture combining Central Difference Convolutional Networks (CDCN) and Dual Attention Network (DAN). The two top ranked solutions used different strategies to boost their models’ performance: a heuristic voting scheme was used by the top-ranked solution, and a weight-after-sorting strategy was used by the second ranked solution.</p><p>The 2021 CSIG Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark107\">77</a> is the second edition of a challenge organised by the China Society of Image and Graphics<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark108\">78</a>. The 2021 challenge has the Fake Media Forensic Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark109\">79</a> as its 6 track, co-organised by CSIG’s Digital Media Forensics and Security Technical Committee<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark110\">80</a> and Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark111\">81</a>. This track has two tasks, one on deepfake video detection, and the other on deepfake audio/speech detection. For the deepfake video detection task, the dataset used contains a public training set with 10,000 sound-free face videos (including 4,000 fake videos), a public test set with 20,000 face videos (the percentage of deepfake videos is unknown to participants), and a private test set that will be determined and used at the final session for selecting the winners. All videos contain faces of Eastern Asian people, and cover a wide range of parameters such as multiple resolutions and encoding quality factors, the use of blurring or sharpening filters, and added noise. Deepfake videos were created using public tools including DeepFaceLab [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark190\">53</a>], Faceswap<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark112\">82</a>, Faceswap-GAN, Recycle-GAN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark143\">6</a>] and ALAE (Adversarial Latent Autoencoders) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark191\">54</a>]. For the deepfake audio/speech detection task, the dataset used contains a public training set with 10,000 speech samples (including 6,000 fake ones), a public test set with 20,000 face videos (the percentage of deepfake videos is unknown to participants), and a private test set for the final session (the same as the deepfake video detection task). The tools used for generating the fake speech samples include TTS (text-to-speech) voice synthesis tools and VC (voice conversion) tools. The main TTS tools used include open-source tools such as DeepVoice, TensorFlowTTS<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark114\">83</a> and GAN-TTS [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark145\">8</a>] and commercial software tools such as those from iFlytek<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark115\">84</a> and IBM. The main VC tools used include Adaptive-VC and CycleGAN-VC [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark166\">29</a>]. For both deepfake detection tasks, the performance metric used is log loss.</p><p>2020 China Artificial Intelligence<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark116\">85</a> was the second edition of a Chinese AI competition open for the general public to participate, organised by the municipal government of the City of Xiamen in China. In 2020, it had two sub-competitions, Multimedia Information Recognition Technology Competition<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark117\">86</a> and Language and Knowledge Technology Competition<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark118\">87</a>. The Multimedia Information Recognition Technology Competition included two tasks on deepfakes: one on deepfake video detection<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark119\">88</a> and one on deepfake audio/speech detection<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark120\">89</a>. The deepfake video detection task used 3,000 videos, and log loss was used as the sole performance metric. The deepfake audio/speech detection task used 20,000 audio samples (mostly in Chinese, and the remaining in English), and EER was used as the sole performance metric. For both tasks, the ratio between real and deepfake samples was 1:1. We did not find where to download the datasets used for the tasks nor a more detailed technical description of the datasets. For the deepfake video detection tasks, the top two winning teams (with an A prize) were from Netease (Hangzhou) Network Co., Ltd. and Beijing RealAI Technology Co., Ltd., followed by three other teams winning a B prize: Xiamen Fuyun Information Technology Co., Ltd.; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; and Wuhan Daqian Information Technology Co., Ltd. For the deepfake audio/speech task, there was no team winning an A prize, but one team winning a B prize: SpeakIn Technologies Co., Ltd. The final results of some teams were published, but some teams were allowed to hide their results. We did not find a detailed technical report summarising the results and explaining the work of the winning teams.</p><p>One of the B-prize winning team is from Beijing RealAI Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese company active in deepfake-related R&amp;D.</p><p>The Voice Conversion Challenge<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark121\">90</a> is a biennial competition that has been running since 2016. The challenge and the corresponding workshop, hosted at the INTERSPEECH conference<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark122\">91</a>, is supported by the SynSig (Speech Synthesis Special Interest Group)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark123\">92</a> of the International Speech Communication Association (ISCA)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark124\">93</a>. Its aim is to promote progress in voice conversion (VC) technology that can be applied to a number of positive and negative use cases, such as spoofing voice biometric systems. The 2020 challenge focused on speaker conversion, a sub-problem of VC, and included two tasks. For the first task “intra-lingual semi-parallel voice conversion”, participants had to develop 16 VC systems (speaker-pair combinations) including male and female speakers and English sentences, using the provided Voice Conversion Challenge 2020 database v1.0 for training (refer to Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>). For the second task “cross-lingual voice conversion”, participants had to develop 24 VC systems, also including male and female speakers, but uttering sentences in three languages (Finnish, German and Mandarin), based on the provided training dataset. Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark126\">6</a> illustrates the process of training and generation of VC systems.</p><p>Submissions were evaluated for “<em>perceived naturalness and similarity through listening tests</em>”<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark125\">94</a>. As such, the organisers used  [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark207\">70</a>] and recruited both native and non-native English speakers (i.e., Japanese native speakers) via crowd-sourcing for the listening tests. Naturalness (answering the question “How natural does the converted voice sound? ”) was measured using the metric MOS (covered in Section 4.6), and similarity (answering the question “how similar the converted voice sound comparing source and target speakers? ”) was measured in terms of speaker recognition as “same” or “different”, as elaborated by Wester et al. [68]. Tests also focused on the effects of language differences on the performance of VC systems submitted to the competition. The most popular CNN/RNN/GANbased VC systems submitted used WaveNet, WaveRNN, and Parallel WaveGAN. Results indicated that, in terms of similarity, the best performing VC systems were as good as natural speech but none reached human-level naturalness for task 1; scores were lower for task 2 which was more complex [70]. The organisers of the 2020 competition also used objective evaluation [12]. The metrics used for evaluation of speaker similarity were: equal error rate (EER), false acceptance rate of target (P tar fa ), miss rate of source (P src miss), and cosine similarity of speaker embedding vectors (cos-sim) according to Eq. (19) where A is the speaker embedding vectors for the converter audio and B is the speaker embedding vectors for the original audio. The performance of the VC systems as a spoof countermeasure was also evaluated using EER, while to evaluate the quality of the subjective MOS obtained via listening tests, a DL-based model to predict MOS, called MOSNet [43], was used. Lastly, to evaluate intelligibility of the converted transcribed speech, in comparison with the original transcribed speech, the word error rate (WER) [4] was used. WER is calculated according to Eq. (20) where I refers to insertions, D refers to deletions, S refers to substitutions, and N refers to the total number of words in the original transcript.</p><p>The Deepfake Africa Challenge (2021)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark129\">95</a> is a new initiative of the AI Africa Expo, in partnership with a film and media production company (Wesgro) and the African Data Science competition platform Zindi. Its aim is “<em>to create convincing deepfakes to highlight the power of this synthetic media, illustrating its creative potential for exploitation for both positive and negative outcomes and focusing debate about its ethical use / misuse in an African context</em> ”. Eligible participants were required to be citizens and residents of the African continent. Submissions, accepted up to end of July 2021, can be either video or audio. Evaluation of submissions is defined in terms of artistic creativity, relevance of challenge topic, and innovation in the process of generation as long as participants use tools and packages publicly available. The top three finalists will receive a prize, present their work at the Expo, and will have to grant copyrights to Zindi. Unlike the other competitions reviewed in this section, which were focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in detection of synthetic or manipulated media, this competition focused on the generation of deepfake which seems more humanities-centred. This is a trend observed in arts [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark168\">31</a>] and culture [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark194\">57</a>].5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generation and Detection of Manipulated Media</p><p>The DeepFake Game Competition (DFGC)<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark132\">96</a> is in its first edition, hosted at the 2021 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB 2021). Its organisers are mainly from the Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA). The idea of the competition was to promote an adversarial game between agents pushing for advances in both deepfake creation and detection. In order to achieve this, a 6-stage protocol was designed interleaving three creation phase (C-phase) and detection phase (D-phase), typically one week apart; submissions closed in April 2021. Both C-phases and D-phases were bound to the Celeb-DF (v2) dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark177\">40</a>], containing 6,229 videos (590 real/original videos and 5,639 fake/manipulated videos), for training purposes. As such, submissions to a C-phase would consist of datasets extracted from Celeb-DF (v2) which included novel face-swap approaches to obtain evaluation results. Submissions to a D-phase would consist of detection models/codes to obtain evaluation results. The models submitted for a D-phase were evaluated against the datasets submitted for the previous C-phase [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark189\">52</a>]. The metrics used for evaluation<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark133\">97</a> were: a detection score, used for evaluation of a D-phase, and a creation score, used for evaluation of a C-phase. The top three finalists for the detection phase employed CNN-based classifiers EfficientNet-B3, Efficientnet-B0 and EfficientNetV2.</p><p>The Detection Score () metric captures the models’ ability to correctly classify fake images submitted to the previous C-phase against a set of real images in the CelebDF test dataset. It is calculated using Eq.

They highlighted two overall reflections about the competition: (1) the limited diversity of the deepfake datasets submitted and the use of repetitive methods to generate them, and (2) the limited size of the Celeb-DF (v2) dataset itself flagging the need for a larger dataset for next year’s competition. The organisers of the competition also applied the top two detection models to unseen datasets (DFDC and FaceForensics++) and noticed that they do not generalise well.</p><p>This section presents a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers, including eight published in English [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark183\">46</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>–<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark210\">73</a>] and four published in Chinese [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark144\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>].

This is also reflected in how the authors of the 12 survey papers considered this aspect. Most authors talked about the history of deepfakes and pointed out that the term reflects the combination of “deep learning” and “fake”, but some used a broader definition, e.g., Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] defined deepfake as “<em>high quality fake videos and audios generated by AI algorithms</em>”. Some authors also referred to deepfake-related legislations, but none of them pointed out that the definitions in some such legislations are completely different from the more technical definitions involving the use of deep learning. No authors discussed the blurred boundary between deepfakes and non-deepfakes, although some surveys actually cover both, e.g., Tao et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>] focused on speech forgery and did not explicitly highlight “deepfake”.</p><p>In terms of the scope, while some authors (correctly) considered all types of media that can be produced by deepfake-related techniques [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark202\">65</a>], some considered only a narrow scope, e.g., authors of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark144\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark210\">73</a>] considered only videos, and only authors of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>] have considered images and videos. Another phenomenon we observed is that many authors focused more on face images and videos, and authors of three surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>] even limited the definition of “deepfake” to such a narrow scope:</p><ul><li>Deshmukh and Wankhade [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>] defined it as “<em>a technology which creates fake images or videos of targeted humans by swapping their faces [by] another character saying or doing things that are not absolutely done by them and humans start believing in such fake as it is not always recognisable with the everyday human eye</em>”;</li><li>Younus and Hasan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>] considered deepfake as a technique allowing “<em>any computer user to exchange the face of one person with another digitally in any video</em>”; and</li><li>Tolosana et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>] defined it as “<em>a deep learning based technique able to create fake videos by swapping the face of a person by the face of another person</em>”.</li></ul><p>Such unnecessarily narrow definitions and scopes can lead to confusion and do not help exchanges between researchers and practitioners working on different types of deepfakes.</p><p>We call on more researchers to accept a broader definition of “deepfake” so that highly realistic/natural media of any kind generated by a sophisticated automated method (often AI-based) is considered deepfake. Here, we provide two examples of such a broader definition: the image2image (or pixel2pixel) technique [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark217\">80</a>] that allows the production of deepfake images and videos of any objects (e.g., the “horse2zebra” deepfake image shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark135\">7</a>), and the the so-called “deepfake geography [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark214\">77</a>]”, where AI-based techniques are used to generate realistic-looking satellite images.</p><p>\\\nAnother important fact missed or not sufficiently discussed by authors of all the 12 surveys is that deepfake techniques can be used for positive applications, e.g., creative arts, entertainment and protecting online users’ privacy. We call for more researchers and practitioners to follow the proposal in the 2020 Tencent AI White Paper [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark197\">60</a>] to start using the more neutral-sounding term “deep synthesis”. Accordingly,we can use different words for different types of data generated using “deep synthesis” techniques, e.g., “deep art”, “deep animation”, “deep music”, and “deepfake”. While authors of the 12 survey papers did not recognise the positive applications of “deepfake” technologies, some other researchers did, e.g., organisers of the Voice Conversion Challenge 2020<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark136\">99</a> who said the VC technology (for speech deepfake) “<em>is useful in many applications, such as customizing audio book and avatar voices, dubbing, movie industry, teleconferencing, singing voice modification, voice restoration after surgery, and cloning of voices of historical persons</em>”.</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the 12 surveys have covered performance metrics explicitly. Some directly used performance metrics to explain and compare performance of covered deepfake generation and detection methods. The most used performance metrics include accuracy, ERR, and AUC. This may be explained by the page constraints of such survey papers, which did not allow the authors to extend their coverage significantly to cover performance metrics systematically. The subjective quality of deepfakes is an area least covered by the surveys, which seems related to an unbalanced coverage on deepfake generation and deepfake detection in terms of performance evaluation and comparison (the former much less than the latter).</p><p>Many of the 12 survey papers list a number of deepfake-related datasets, but none of them have coverage as complete as ours shown in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>. For instance, none of the surveys have covered the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016/2018/2020 datasets and the ASVspoof 2019/2021 datasets are covered briefly only in two surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>]. In addition, more recent deepfake datasets especially those released in 2021 are also not covered by any of the surveys. We believe that our Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a> is the most comprehensive review of deepfake-related datasets so far.</p><p>Some survey papers include datasets that are likely deepfakes, e.g., Verdoliva [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>] covered many general fake image datasets where the manipulated images were not generated by deep learning or even AI-based methods, and some surveys (e.g., [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>]) mentioned ASVspoof 2015 datasets but we did not see the use of deep learning for generating data used in the dataset.</p><p>Many surveys cover deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks. The coverage is, however, mostly limited, and some challenges (e.g., the Voice Conversion Challenge 2016/2018/2020 and the two Chinese challenges we covered in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>) are not covered by any of the surveys. The level of detail of challenges, competitions and benchmarks is also normally limited, compared with what we chose to include in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a>. Similar to the datasets we covered in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark35\">4</a>, we believe that our coverage of deepfake-related challenges, competitions and benchmarks in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark74\">5</a> is also the most comprehensive so far.</p><p>Most surveys have a good coverage of related methods for deepfake generation and detection, but only some explicitly covered performance comparison between different methods [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark183\">46</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>].</p><p>Among all the survey papers, Li et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>] conducted the most comprehensive study on performance of different deepfake detection methods. In addition to showing the performance metrics of a number of deepfake detection methods in Table 3 of [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>], they also looked at general characteristics and issues of different types of deepfake detection methods, as shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark137\">4</a>. Furthermore, they also looked at research on robustness of deepfake detection methods against adversarial samples, referring to some work that showed a lack of such robustness.</p><p>Due to quality issues of many deepfake-related datasets (discussed in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark64\">4.6</a>), we need to treat any performance metrics and comparison of different detection methods with caution. Without testing all methods on a sufficiently large, diverse and high-quality deepfake dataset, the performance comparison results can be misleading. This highlights the importance of having more challenges, competitions and benchmarks to encourage performance comparison on standard datasets and using consistent performance metrics.</p><p>The authors of some surveys identified some key challenges and future research directions for the deepfake community.</p><p>Not surprisingly, how to develop more robust, scalable, generalisable and explainable deepfake detection methods is one of the most discussed key challenges and also a major future research direction [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark144\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark202\">65</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>]. Considering the arms race between deepfake generation and detection, this research direction will likely remain the hottest topic in deepfake research.</p><p>A couple of surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark203\">66</a>] mentioned fusion as a key future research direction, where “fusion” refers to combining different methods (e.g., combining multiple detectors of different types) and data sources (e.g., jointly considering audio-visual analysis) to achieve better performance for deepfake detection. Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] suggested that, for detection of deepfake videos, we need to consider video-level detection more, which can be considered fusion of detection results of all video frames.</p><p>The authors of three surveys, Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] , Deshmukh and Wankhade [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark153\">16</a>] and Younus and Hasan [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark208\">71</a>], argued that better (higher-quality, more up-to-date, and more standard) deepfake datasets are needed to develop more effective deepfake detection methods. Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] also suggested that we need to consider  effects in training data and improve the evaluation of datasets. We agree with them on these points.</p><p>Tao et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark196\">59</a>] suggested that low-cost deepfake generation/detection should be considered as a future research direction. This is a valid recommendation since lightweight methods will allow less powerful computing devices (e.g., IoT devices) to benefit from such technologies.</p><p>Two Chinese surveys [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>] also mentioned the need to have new deepfake-related legislations combating malicious use of deepfakes and the need to train end users such as journalists. This is likely an area where interdisciplinary research can grow.</p><p>There are also other ad-hoc recommendations given by the authors of some surveys. For example, Lyu [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark182\">45</a>] argued that deepfake detection should be considered a (more complicated) multi-class, multi-label and local detection problem. Tolosana et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark201\">64</a>] discussed specific research directions for different deep-fake generation methods (face synthesis, identity swap, attribute manipulation, and expression swap). Liang et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark178\">41</a>] and Li et al. [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-researchers-measure-detect-and-benchmark-ai-manipulation?source=rss#_bookmark175\">38</a>] recommended more active defence mechanisms such as using digital watermarking and blockchain technologies to build trustworthy media frameworks against deepfakes.</p><p>The rapid growth in the capability to manipulate media or create synthetic media which look realistic and natural paved the way for deepfakes. At first, this paper adopted a critical approach to look at different definitions of the term “deepfake”. In that regard, we point out the different contradicting definitions and call for the wider community to consider how to define a new term that has a more consistent scope and meaning. For instance, replacing “deepfake” by “deep synthesis” can be more inclusive by embracing positive applications of deepfake techniques, e.g., in entertainment and for simulation purposes.</p><p>This paper provided a comprehensive overview of multiple aspects of the deepfake ecosystem drawing from the research literature and other online sources published in two languages: English and Chinese. It covers commonly used performance metrics and standards, related datasets, challenges, competitions and benchmarks. It also presents a meta-review of 12 selected deepfake-related survey papers published in 2020 and 2021, covering not only the above mentioned aspects, but also highlighting key challenges and recommendations.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Darius Afchar, Vincent Nozick, Junichi Yamagishi, and Isao Echizen. 2018.

For example, consider this program:</p><pre><code>func main() {\n    done := make(chan bool)\n\n    values := []string{\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}\n    for _, v := range values {\n        go func() {\n            fmt.Println(v)\n            done &lt;- true\n        }()\n    }\n\n    // wait for all goroutines to complete before exiting\n    for _ = range values {\n        &lt;-done\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe three created goroutines are all printing the same variable , so they usually print “c”, “c”, “c”, instead of printing “a”, “b”, and “c” in some order.</p><p>\\\nAlthough concurrency is often involved, it need not be. This example has the same problem but no goroutines:</p><pre><code>func main() {\n    var prints []func()\n    for i := 1; i &lt;= 3; i++ {\n        prints = append(prints, func() { fmt.Println(i) })\n    }\n    for _, print := range prints {\n        print()\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThis kind of mistake has caused production problems at many companies, including a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1619047\">publicly documented issue at Lets Encrypt</a>. In that instance, the accidental capture of the loop variable was spread across multiple functions and much more difficult to notice:</p><pre><code>// authz2ModelMapToPB converts a mapping of domain name to authz2Models into a\n// protobuf authorizations map\nfunc authz2ModelMapToPB(m map[string]authz2Model) (*sapb.Authorizations, error) {\n    resp := &amp;sapb.Authorizations{}\n    for k, v := range m {\n        // Make a copy of k because it will be reassigned with each loop.\n        kCopy := k\n        authzPB, err := modelToAuthzPB(&amp;v)\n        if err != nil {\n            return nil, err\n        }\n        resp.Authz = append(resp.Authz, &amp;sapb.Authorizations_MapElement{\n            Domain: &amp;kCopy,\n            Authz: authzPB,\n        })\n    }\n    return resp, nil\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nThe author of this code clearly understood the general problem, because they made a copy of , but it turns out  used pointers to fields in  when constructing its result, so the loop also needed to make a copy of .</p><p>\\\nTools have been written to identify these mistakes, but it is hard to analyze whether references to a variable outlive its iteration or not. These tools must choose between false negatives and false positives. The  analyzer used by  and  opts for false negatives, only reporting when it is sure there is a problem but missing others. Other checkers opt for false positives, accusing correct code of being incorrect. We ran an analysis of commits adding  lines in open-source Go code, expecting to find bug fixes. Instead we found many unnecessary lines being added, suggesting instead that popular checkers have significant false positive rates, but developers add the lines anyway to keep the checkers happy.</p><p>\\\nOne pair of examples we found was particularly illuminating:</p><p>This diff was in one program:</p><pre><code>     for _, informer := range c.informerMap {\n+        informer := informer\n         go informer.Run(stopCh)\n     }\n</code></pre><p>\\\nAnd this diff was in another program:</p><pre><code>     for _, a := range alarms {\n+        a := a\n         go a.Monitor(b)\n     }\n</code></pre><p>\\\nOne of these two diffs is a bug fix; the other is an unnecessary change. You can’t tell which is which unless you know more about the types and functions involved.</p><p>For Go 1.22, we plan to change  loops to make these variables have per-iteration scope instead of per-loop scope. This change will fix the examples above, so that they are no longer buggy Go programs; it will end the production problems caused by such mistakes; and it will remove the need for imprecise tools that prompt users to make unnecessary changes to their code.</p><p>\\\nTo ensure backwards compatibility with existing code, the new semantics will only apply in packages contained in modules that declare  or later in their  files. This per-module decision provides developer control of a gradual update to the new semantics throughout a codebase. It is also possible to use  lines to control the decision on a per-file basis.</p><p>\\\nOld code will continue to mean exactly what it means today: the fix only applies to new or updated code. This will give developers control over when the semantics change in a particular package. As a consequence of our <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/toolchain\">forward compatibility work</a>, Go 1.21 will not attempt to compile code that declares  or later. We included a special case with the same effect in the point releases Go 1.20.8 and Go 1.19.13, so when Go 1.22 is released, code written depending on the new semantics will never be compiled with the old semantics, unless people are using very old, <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy\">unsupported Go versions</a>.</p><p>Go 1.21 includes a preview of the scoping change. If you compile your code with  set in your environment, then the new semantics are applied to all loops (ignoring the  lines). For example, to check whether your tests still pass with the new loop semantics applied to your package and all your dependencies:</p><pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar go test\n</code></pre><p>\\\nWe patched our internal Go toolchain at Google to force this mode during all builds at the start of May 2023, and in the past four months we have had zero reports of any problems in production code.</p><p>\\\nYou can also try test programs to better understand the semantics on the Go playground by including a  comment at the top of the program, like in <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/YchKkkA1ETH\">this program</a>. (This comment only applies in the Go playground.)</p><p>Although we’ve had no production problems, to prepare for that switch, we did have to correct many buggy tests that were not testing what they thought they were, like this:</p><pre><code>func TestAllEvenBuggy(t *testing.T) {\n    testCases := []int{1, 2, 4, 6}\n    for _, v := range testCases {\n        t.Run(\"sub\", func(t *testing.T) {\n            t.Parallel()\n            if v&amp;1 != 0 {\n                t.Fatal(\"odd v\", v)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>\\\nIn Go 1.21, this test passes because  blocks each subtest until the entire loop has finished and then runs all the subtests in parallel. When the loop has finished,  is always 6, so the subtests all check that 6 is even, so the test passes. Of course, this test really should fail, because 1 is not even. Fixing for loops exposes this kind of buggy test.</p><p>\\\nTo help prepare for this kind of discovery, we improved the precision of the  analyzer in Go 1.21 so that it can identify and report this problem. You can see the report <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/WkJkgXRXg0m\">in this program</a> on the Go playground. If  is reporting this kind of problem in your own tests, fixing them will prepare you better for Go 1.22.</p><p>\\\nIf you run into other problems, <a href=\"https://go.dev/wiki/LoopvarExperiment#my-test-fails-with-the-change-how-can-i-debug-it\">the FAQ</a> has links to examples and details about using a tool we’ve written to identify which specific loop is causing a test failure when the new semantics are applied.</p><p>\\\n<em>This article is available on&nbsp;&nbsp;under a CC BY 4.0 DEED license.</em></p>","contentLength":6922,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why “Small Changes” Don’t Exist in Production Game Systems","url":"https://hackernoon.com/why-small-changes-dont-exist-in-production-game-systems?source=rss","date":1772294403,"author":"Constantine","guid":395,"unread":true,"content":"<p>It’s just a small change!</p><p>\\\nHow often do we hear that we need to fix something? We need to add a small feature. We need to tweak something. Code-wise or publishing, just realized they need this for retention, or maybe an analyst brought the newest data, so now we have to add just a few lines to the code. They don’t affect performance or any other departments, I promise. And it’s just like 3 minutes of coder work - why not? Fast forward: they broke the “Buy” button on the front page of the store on release.</p><p>\\\nWhy does this always happen with small changes? Well, if we think about it, we don’t usually think about it. Let me explain:</p><p>Designers think in features and user experience. \\n Engineers think in whole systems. \\n Producers think in tasks. \\n Stakeholders think in business outcomes.</p><p>\\\nAnd one small change is always perceived as something isolated and usually without everyone’s awareness. So, it is basically a cognitive shortcut. And that happens not because everyone is wrong or unprofessional. It’s because modern production systems are highly interconnected, so it’s impossible to know what could potentially be affected by anything - especially if you haven’t worked on this project for 15 years.</p><p>What is modern production? I’m glad you asked!</p><p>\\\nIt doesn’t matter if you build games or a banking app - you don’t just have a pile of features and assets. You have an ecosystem for each bit of work: Art, Code, Design, UI, Marketing, Publishing (maybe even Project Management - wow, you are a rich developer), etc. And each one of them has its own infrastructure, pipelines, workflows, and shared assets. To simplify, it can be shared data schemas, builds, automation processes, UI bindings, and many other things.</p><p>\\\nWhat’s wrong if I just make a small color change to one of the icons? Well, that means you spend 3 seconds changing a color code. Then you have to assemble a build. Then QA has to check your small change to confirm that you indeed changed the color. Then you have to assemble the build again, which should be in a queue with other builds in the waiting list.</p><p>\\\nThen we have to update the server with your changes - oh wait, did you tell anyone about that? No? Oh, that’s great, because you just submitted your changes during the commit freeze, and now deployment engineers have to fix the CI/CD pipeline, and we have to postpone the release for 4 days because it’s Friday.</p><p>\\\nAnd by the way - we have to communicate that to users because they were waiting for this new version, and some of them decided not to wait that long and removed your app. Whoops, that’s awkward. Sorry to hear that.</p><p>That’s alright, I’m here to help you! Let me introduce you to Change Propagation Surface (CPS) - the number of systems, pipelines, assets, and workflows that a change must pass through before it reaches the player.</p><p>\\\nYour change should not be estimated by its task size, like “1 hour of work.” Your change equals CPS × Coupling Density (the amount of work other departments need to do in order for this change to pass).</p><p>\\\nThink about it this way:</p><ul><li>One small UI tweak touches no shared data - low CPS.</li><li>A gameplay rule change touching code, balance, design, analytics, player experience - high CPS.</li></ul><p>\\\nLet’s go back to the situation where you want to change the color of the icon. Those 3 seconds of work would affect UI, builds, player perception, experience, and design. It might also affect color coding for accessibility rules, plus build assembling, and finally server updates. It’s high CPS - of course, if you didn’t sneak that change in without everyone’s awareness (I see that - drop it!).</p><p>\\\nThe same goes for asset swaps or changing a stat value: it affects memory, AI tuning, destruction logic, etc. Don’t do that unless someone from senior leadership said it’s low CPS - then just do it and see how it goes.</p><p>\\\nYou can apply this approach basically anywhere in production because it is not an abstract thing at all and can be estimated.</p><ul></ul><p>\\\nEach of these items counts as a plus 1 CPS factor. Subsequently, the more of the same “items” you touch, the higher the CPS number you will get. And with that information, you can create a small estimation matrix like:</p><p>CPS 1-2 - Local change \\n CPS 3-5 - Cross-functional change \\n CPS 6+ - Systemic change</p><p>\\\nOne more time, the formula is: Impact = CPS × Coupling Density. Easy!</p><p>Let’s see how it works in a real-life example:</p><p>\\\nSo your developer went on holiday and completed a math course on LinkedIn. And when he came back, he said that there is a more efficient way of calculating EXP. This change is “one line of code.” Okay, but after reading this article, you already know how it works in reality and that it touches multiple things:</p><ul><li>Player progression pacing</li></ul><p>\\\nThat means CPS is more than 7. So now you see that even though the code diff is tiny, the propagation surface is systemic and has a massive potential outcome. In other words, if XP progression speeds up things like economy, availability of the content, battle pass value, retention curves, etc., you should know that even if the implementation takes about 10 minutes, the ripple effect can take weeks of work.</p><p>\\\nWhy does live service production make it worse? Because it is amplified by content being reused across multiple features, by telemetry and economy being tightly coupled, and by systems being persistent and often requiring backward compatibility.</p><p>\\\nSo, the real cost you pay for propagation lies in prolonged timelines, hidden rework, cross-team friction, technical debt, burnout, and eventually, people resigning directly or indirectly.</p><p>\\\nInstead of thinking, “Oh, this is a small change,” we should probably think, “What systems does this change touch?” Think about this as infrastructure, not a feature, and always try to bring that to cross-team awareness. And if you are capable enough, try to estimate the surface area, not just this exact small change.</p><p>\\\n**The whole point of my way-too-long introduction is that there is no such thing as a small change in production systems. There are only changes in misunderstood affected areas. And the more senior you become, the more your vision shifts toward understanding how this change will travel instead of trying to avoid the change altogether.</p>","contentLength":6294,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Meet M6: The Chinese AI That Understands Text and Images at Scale","url":"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss","date":1772292503,"author":"Alibaba","guid":394,"unread":true,"content":"<ol><li>Junyang Lin, junyang.ljy@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Rui Men, menrui.mr@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>An Yang, ya235025@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Chang Zhou, ericzhou.zc@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Ming Ding, dm18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn (Tsinghua University, China)</li><li>Yichang Zhang, yichang.zyc@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Peng Wang, zheluo.wp@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Ang Wang, wangang.wa@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Le Jiang, jiangle.jl@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Xianyan Jia, xianyan.xianyanjia@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jie Zhang, wanglin.zj@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jianwei Zhang, zhangjianwei.zjw@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Xu Zou, zoux18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn (Tsinghua University, China)</li><li>Zhikang Li, zhikang.lzk@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Xiaodong Deng, xiaodongdeng.dxd@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jie Liu, sanshuai.lj@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jinbao Xue, zhiji.xjb@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Huiling Zhou, zhule.zhl@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jianxin Ma, jason.mjx@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jin Yu, kola.yu@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Yong Li, jiufeng.ly@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Wei Lin, weilin.lw@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jingren Zhou, jingren.zhou@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li><li>Jie Tang, jietang@tsinghua.edu.cn (Tsinghua University, China)</li><li>Hongxia Yang, yang.yhx@alibaba-inc.com (Alibaba Group, China)</li></ol><p>In this work, we construct the largest dataset for multimodal pre-training in Chinese, which consists of over 1.9TB images and 292GB texts that cover a wide range of domains.

The recent GPT-3 with over 175 billion parameters demonstrates that large models trained on big data have extremely large capacity and it can outperform the state-of-the-arts in downstream tasks especially in the zero-shot setting. Also, the rapid development of pretraining in NLP sparkles cross-modal pretraining. A number of studies [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark27\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark33\">17</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark38\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark40\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark44\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark45\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark54\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark67\">51</a>] have created new state-of-the-art performances for various cross-modal downstream tasks.</p><p>A pity is that most recent studies focus on the pretraining on English data. There are lack of both large-scale datasets in Chinese and large-scale models pretrained on the data of Chinese. Therefore, in this work, we develop a large-scale dataset M6-Corpus, which consists of over 1.9TB images and 292GB texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset in Chinese for pretraining in both multimodality and natural language. The dataset collected from the webpages consists of different types of data and covers a large scale of domains, including encyclopedia, question answering, forum discussion, product description, etc. Also, we design sophisticated cleaning procedures to ensure that the data are of high quality.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to sufficiently leverage such a large amount of high-quality data, we propose to build an extremely large model that can process data of multiple modalities and adapt to different types of downstream tasks. Thus we propose a novel model called M6, referring to MultiModality-to-MultiModality Multitask Mega-transformer. The model is based on the transformer, and it is pretrained with multiple tasks. Pretraining endows the model with the capability of single-modality and multimodality understanding and generation. Based on the architecture of M6, we build  and , which are scaled up to 10 billion and 100 billion pa-rameters respectively. To be more specific,  is the recent largest model pretrained on Chinese data. We apply the model to a series of downstream applications, including product description generation, visual question answering, community question answering, Chinese poem generation, etc., and our experimental results show that M6 outperforms a series of strong baselines.</p><p>Another contribution of this work is that we first incorporate pretraining with text-to-image generation. Following Ramesh et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark48\">[32]</a>, we leverage a two-stage framework for image generation. To be more specific, we apply a trained vector-quantized generative adversarial network to representing images with discrete image codes, and we then use the pretrained M6 to learn the relations between texts and codes. Such learning can bridge the two modalities and enables controllable text-to-image generation.</p><p>To summarize, the contributions of M6 are as follows:</p><ul><li>We collect and build the largest Chinese multi-modal pre-training data in industry, which includes 300GB texts and 2TB images.</li><li>We propose M6 for multimodal pretraining in Chinese, and we scale the model size to up to 10 and 100 billion parameters. Both M6-10B and M6-100B are the recent largest multimodal pretrained model.</li><li>M6 is versatile and exceeds strong baselines by 11.8% in VQA, 18.4 in image captioning, and 10.3% in image-text matching. Furthermore M6 is able to generate high-quality images.</li><li>With carefully designed large-scale distributed training optimizations, M6 has obvious advantages in training speed and greatly reduces training costs, creating the possibility for more widespread use of multi-modal pretraining.</li></ul><p>We collect and develop the largest multi-modality and text dataset in Chinese for now, which is one of the key contributions of this paper. In this section, we first identify the limitations of existing datasets and then describe the construction and preprocessing procedure of our proposed dataset.</p><h2>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing Datasets</h2><p>The construction of large-scale corpus with high quality and do-main coverage is crucial to Chinese pretraining. In early previous works, the Chinese Wikipedia1&nbsp;is one of the most frequently used datasets to train Chinese language models. It contains 1.6GB texts (around 0.4B tokens) covering around 1M encyclopedia entries. Another corpus with a comparable size is the THUCTC[<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark55\">39</a>] dataset, which includes 740K news articles. However, with the rapidly increasing capacity of recent language models, the scale of these existing datasets is clearly insufficient. Recently, Cui et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark21\">[5]</a> employ unreleased extended data that are 10 times larger than the CN-Wikipedia to pretrain their Chinese language model. Xu et al.</p><p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark63\">[47]</a> released a 100GB corpus named CLUECorpus2020, which is retried from the multilingual Common Crawl dataset. However, the scale of the datasets is still insufficient to facilitate super large-scale pretraining compared with existing English pretrained models. For example, GPT-3 contains 175B parameters and is trained on 570GB texts. Meanwhile, the dataset should contain image-text pairs rather than plain texts for multi-modal pretraining.</p><h2>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standards for a High-quality Dataset</h2><p>To perform large-scale multi-modal pretraining and learn complex world knowledge in Chinese, the dataset is highly required to provide both plain texts and image-text pairs on super large scale, covering a wide range of domains. In order to perform large-scale multi-modal pretraining in Chinese, we focus on the construction of large-scale datasets in Chinese. Specifically, while we unify our pretraining for both natural language and multimodalities, we construct large datasets of both plain texts and image-text pairs. We are interested in obtaining large-scale data that covers a wide range of domains, so that it is possible for the model to learn the complex world knowledge of different fields. Also, we aim to collect data of multiple modalities for the cross-modal pretraining. This raises the difficulty for the construction of a large-scale dataset as the data for multimodal pretraining are usually image-text pairs, where in each pair the text provides a detailed description of a fraction of the image.</p><p>Though there are a tremendous amount of text resources and images on the world wide web, the corpus for multimodal pretraining is assumed to be better when satisfying the following properties:</p><p>(1). the sentences should be fluent natural language within a normal length, and should not contain meaningless tokens, such as markups, duplicate punctuation marks, random combinations of characters, etc.; (2). the images should be natural and realistic, and the resolutions of the images need to be identifiable by humans; (3). both the texts and images should not contain illegal content, such as pornography, violence, etc.; (4). the images and texts should be semantically relevant; (5). the datasets should cover a wide range of fields, say sports, politics, science, etc., and therefore it can endow the model with sufficient world knowledge.</p><h2>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dataset Construction</h2><p>Based on the requirements above, we collect data of both plain texts and image-text pairs. There are different types of data, including encyclopedia, crawled webpage, community question answering, forum, product description, etc. We present the details in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark2\">3.</a> The collected corpus consists of bothag plain-texts and image-text pairs, which is compatible with the designed text-only and multi-modal pretraining tasks. Also, the data has a large coverage over domains, such as science, entertainment, sports, politics, common-sense of life, etc. We have also compared some characteristics of our corpus with existing datasets used for Chinese pretraining in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2.</a> The size of our dataset is much larger than the previous ones. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, multimodal and multidomain corpus for Chinese pretraining.</p><p>We implement sophisticated preprocessing to obtain clean data. For text data, we first remove HTML markups and duplicate punctuation marks, and we only reserve characters and punctuation marks that are in Chinese and English. We remove the topics that are shorter than 5 characters and contents shorter than 15 characters. We further apply in-house spam detection to remove sentences that contain words related to certain political issues, pornography, or words in the list of dirty, naughty, and other bad words. In order to preserve the linguistic acceptance of the texts, we implement a language model to evaluate their perplexities, and sentences with high perplexities are discarded. Only images with at least 5000 pixels are reserved for pretraining. A sequence of classifiers and heuristic rules are applied to filter out images containing illegal content. We also use a pretrained image scorer to evaluate the qual-ities of images. For images and texts in crawled webpages, we only consider images and their surrounding text as relevant image-text pairs. Other sentences in the webpages are discarded.</p><p>Multimodal pretraining leverages both the power of self-attention-based transformer architecture and pretraining on large-scale data. We endeavor to endow the model with strong capability of cross-modal understanding and generation. In this section, we describe the details of our proposed pretrained model , which refers to ulti-odality-to-ulti-odality ultitask ega-transformer.</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Å &nbsp; Visual and Linguistic Inputs</h2><p>The mainstream multimodal pretraining methods transform images to feature sequences via object detection. However, the performance of the object detectors as well as the expressivity of their backbones strongly impact the final performance of the pretrained models in the downstream tasks. We observe that a large proportion of the images contain only a few objects. Take the images of the data of e-commerce as an example. We randomly sample 1M images and perform object detection on the images. The results show that over 90% of the images contain fewer than 5 objects. Also, the objects have high overlapping with each other. To alleviate such influence, we turn to a simple but effective solution following Gao et al. [\\[12\\]](#<em>bookmark28) and Dosovitskiy et al. [\\[8\\]](#</em>bookmark24). In general, we split an image into patches and extract features of the 2D patches with a trained feature extractor, say ResNet-50. Then we line up the representations to a sequence by their positions.  The processing of the input word sequence is much simpler. We follow the similar preprocessing procedures in the previous work [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark27\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark40\">24</a>]. We apply WordPiece [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark50\">34</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark61\">45</a>] and masking to the word sequence and embed them with an embedding layer, following BERT <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark22\">[6].</a></p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unified Encoder-Decoder</h2><p>We integrate the image embeddings 𝑒𝑖&nbsp;and the word embeddings 𝑒𝑡&nbsp;into the cross-modal embedding sequence 𝑒 = {𝑒𝑖, 𝑒𝑡 }. We send the sequence to the transformer backbone for high-level feature extraction. To differ their representations, we add corresponding segment embeddings for different modalities. Specifically, we leverage the</p><p>self-attention-based transformer blocks for our unified cross-modal representation learning. To be more specific, the building block is identical to that of BERT or GPT, which consists of self attention and point-wise feed-forward network (FFN). On top of the transformer backbone, we add an output layer for word prediction, and thus we tie its weights to those of the embedding layer.</p><p>In the unified framework, we use different masking strategies to enable encoding and decoding. The input is segmented into three parts, including visual inputs, masked linguistic inputs, and complete linguistic inputs. We apply bidirectional masking to both the visual inputs and masked linguistic inputs, and we apply causal masking to the complete linguistic inputs. Thus the model is allowed to encode and decode in the same framework.</p><h2>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretraining Methods</h2><p>We pretrain the model with the multitask setup, including text-to-text transfer, image-to-text transfer, and multimodality-to-text transfer. Thus the model can process information of different modalities and perform both single-modal and cross-modal understanding and generation.</p><p> As demonstrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3,</a> the model learns to perform text denoising and language modeling in the setting of text-to-text transfer. In text denoising, we mask the input text by a proportion, which is 15% in practice following BERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark22\">6</a>]. Specifically, we mask a continuous span of text with a single mask, and the model should learn to decode the whole sequence. This encourages the model to learn both recovering and length predict-ing. Besides, in order to improve the model ability in generation, we add a setup of language modeling, where the encoder receives no inputs and the decoder learns to generate words based on the previous context.</p><p>\\\n Image-to-text transfer is similar to image captioning, where the model receives the visual information as the input, and learns to generate a corresponding description. In this setting, we add the aforementioned patch feature sequence to the input and leave the masked input blank. The model encodes the patch features, and decodes the corresponding text.</p><p><strong>Multimodality-to-text transfer</strong> Based on the setup of image-to-text transfer, we additionally add masked linguistic inputs, and thus the model should learn to generate the target text based on both the visual information and the noised linguistic information. This task allows the model to adapt to the downstream tasks with both visual and linguistic inputs.</p><h2>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scaling up to 10 and 100 Billion Parameters</h2><p>We scale up the model size to 10 billion parameters and 100 billion parameters, which are named M6-10B and M6-100B. The increase in model size provides a much larger capacity for the model that it can learn knowledge from more data. For the construction of M6-10B, we simply scale up the model by hyperparameter tuning.</p><p>To be more specific, we increase the size of hidden states and the number of layers. To better leverage GPU memory, we apply mixed-precision training and activation checkpointing to save memory. Still, the model cannot be fit into one single GPU, and thus we use model parallelism to split the feed-forward networks and attention heads to multiple GPUs following the implementation of Megatron-LM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark52\">[36].</a></p><p>However, directly scaling up to M6-100B is much more difficult as there are more challenges for the computation resources. Alternatively, inspired by the recent progress in sparse activations [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark26\">10</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark36\">20</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark51\">35</a>], we combine Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with M6 to build the version of 100 billion parameters. Note that the original MoE requires mesh-tensorflow as well as TPUs. This sets limits for a number of researchers without such resources. Thus we implement the M6-100B with MoE with our in-house framework Whale [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark59\">43</a>] to perform model parallelism with GPUs. We demonstrate the key statistics of the models of different scales in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark4\">4.</a></p><p>Specifically, different from the conventional FFN layer, the MoE layer is a parallel combination of multiple FFN layers, each of which acts as an expert. This is also called expert parallelism. The model first learns a sparse gating network to route the tokens to specific experts. Thus each token is only sent to a small set of experts and the computation can be much less compared with that in dense models. This kind of model is highly efficient as it realizes data parallelism and expert parallelism across workers. The computation of MoE layer for a specific token 𝑥 can be described as below:</p><p>where 𝑔(·) refers to the sparse gating function, and T refers to the indices of top-𝑘 values of 𝑔(·). The output of MoE is a linear combination of the computation of selected expert FFNs 𝑓 (·).</p><p>In expert parallelism, the parameters of experts do not share across workers, while those of other parts are identical across workers. Therefore, it is necessary to perform all-to-all communication across workers at the MoE layers in order to dispatch tokens to selected experts and combine them to their original experts. While Lepikhin et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark36\">[20]</a> and Fedus et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark26\">[10]</a> implement the MoE on TPUs with one expert in each MoE layer on a TPU, we implement our model on Nvidia GPUs where there are several experts in each MoE layer on a GPU so as to fully utilize the memory. As all-to-all communication takes up a large amount of time, the optimization to improve efficiency is highly significant. We implement a series of optimization, including half-precision communication. A key problem is load balancing, which denotes that tokens can gather to only a few experts due to dynamic routing. Following Fedus et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark26\">[10]</a>, we apply expert capacity, which refers to the number of tokens for an expert (𝐶 = 𝑁&nbsp;- 𝑐/m, where 𝐶 refers to expert capacity, 𝑁 refers to the number of tokens in a batch, 𝑐 refers to capacity factor (which is a hyperparameter usually larger than 1.0) and 𝑚 refers to the number of experts), to alleviate this problem. Tokens out of the capacity of an expert are dropped from the computation and they are sent to next layers through residual connections. We find that the overloading problem can be severe, and this issue can be a significant one in the future research of expert models.</p><p>Besides the optimization in all-to-all communication, we com-pare the top-2 gating and top-1 gating and find that they can achieve similar model performance in perplexity, while the latter converges slightly slower. The effectiveness of top-1 gating enables faster computation. Besides, we also apply methods of memory optimization for higher efficiency. We find that gradient clipping globally can increase costs on all-to-all communication as it computes norms across all experts, and thus we apply local clipping for memory saving. We implement M6-100B with around 100 billion parameters on 128 Nvidia A100s and the speed of pretraining achieves 1440 samples/s (for samples of the sequence length of 272).</p><p>We demonstrate that using MoE structure for model size scaling is effective and it can achieve similar performance to that of M6-10B, the largest dense model, within 2-3 times shorter time. The negative log perplexity of M6-100B reaches −2.297, in comparison with M6-10B that reaches −2.253 but with twice of time.2 This shows that the MoE-based M6 model has advantages on the time basis compared with dense models with many more FLOPs.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Text-to-Image Generation</h2><p>Text-to-image generation has been an open problem for a long time. Previous studies mainly focused on generation on a limited domain, among which Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark30\">14</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark64\">48</a>] are dominated methods. Following Ramesh et al. <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark48\">[32]</a>, we leverage a two-stage framework for text-to-image generation, including discrete representation learning and language modeling.</p><p>\\\nIn the first stage, we focus on transforming images into sequences of discrete codes. There are a number of alternatives for discrete code generation, including VQVAE [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark57\">41</a>] and VQGAN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark25\">9</a>]. In the second stage, it is necessary to build a language model to learn to generate text and code sequence. In the finetuning, we add code embedding and output layers to the pretrained M6. We concat the word sequence and the aforementioned generated code sequence as the input, and we set the objective of autoregressive language modeling for the training. At the stage of inference, we input the text sequence, and the model generates codes autoregressively with top-k sampling. The last step is to transform the code sequence to an image with the generator from the first stage.</p><p>We construct a dataset for text-to-image generation in E-commerce. Specifically, we collect over 50 million product titles and images from the mobile Taobao. We apply a series of processing methods on the images to filter the unqualified. We filter the images with complex background features (characters, patterns, etc.) with the in-house white-background image detector and OCR model. We then filter the images with over 3 objects with our in-house object detector based on Faster R-CNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark49\">33</a>]. We finally obtain 1.8m high-quality product image-text pairs for finetuning. Compared with the images in the general domains, our collected data have the following features. The image and text are highly correlated as the text describes key features of the product, and there is no complex background in the images, which is easier to learn compared with the images in the public datasets such as MSCOCO <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark42\">[26].</a></p><p>We demonstrate two examples in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark7\">4</a> and Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark8\">5.</a> It can be found that the generated images have high quality and the generated objects resemble the real ones. Furthermore, in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark9\">6</a> , we find that the model is able to imagine items according to the query <em>military style camouflage high heels(军旅风迷彩高跟鞋</em>), which do not exist in the real world. The imagination ability provides room for creative design in real-world industrial scenarios, such as clothing design, shoe design, etc.</p><p>We also finetune M6 under our proposed framework on another dataset which contains 3 million images crawled from the Internet, which cover more general domains. And we find that the model can adapt to different domains. As shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark10\">7,</a> the model is able to generate clip arts of robots . This reveals the versatility of the framework in text-to-image generation.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visual Question Answering</h2><p>We demonstrate our experimental results on a visual question answering dataset, and we illustrate how we directly apply the pre-trained M6 to the VQA application.</p><p>\\\nWe leverage the FMIQA dataset [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark29\">13</a>] as the Chinese visual QA benchmark, which requires the model to generate the answer given an image and a question. We implement a transformer-based model as our baseline. For the evaluation, we split the test set manually by random sampling 200 from the dataset as there is no official release of the test set, and we evaluate the overall accuracy by human evaluation. The results are demonstrated in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark5\">5.</a> The pretrained M6-base outperforms the baseline by a large margin (+6.2%), which indicates the effectiveness of multimodal pretraining. Scaling up the model to M6-10B further brings 5.2% improvement.</p><p>Furthermore, we show that simply finetuning on such a small VQA dataset may limit the potential of M6. Therefore, we directly leverage M6 for the VQA application. We find that the model is able to recognize general features and provide more related knowledge based on its understanding. Though the model pretrained on pseudo-parallel image-text pairs cannot directly answer questions about detailed features, such as color, number, etc., it is able to answer questions related to background knowledge. We demonstrate some examples in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark12\">8.</a></p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image Captioning</h2><p>Image captioning requires the model to generate a caption that describes the given image, which examines the model ability of cross-modal generation. We construct a dataset (named E-Commerce IC) containing pairs of product descriptions and product images from Taobao. Since too long or too short descriptions may be noisy, we discard pairs with a description longer than 100 words or less than 10 words. To avoid dirty generations, we further use an in-house tool to filter descriptions that may contain dirty words (i.e., pornographic or violent words). Finally, E-Commerce IC contains about 260k text-image pairs. We finetune the model with the image-to-text transfer task on E-Commerce IC.</p><p>\\\nWe compare our model with a baseline of transformer in the human evaluation. We ask several annotators with the linguistic background to evaluate from three perspectives: grammar (whether a text is fluent without grammatical error), correctness (whether a text is faithful to the image), richness (whether a text is informative and attractive). During the evaluation, we randomly sample 100 images from the test set. For each image, an annotator is asked to score the text generated by different models. The scores are within the range of [0, 5].</p><p>The results in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark11\">6</a> show that M6-base outperforms the baseline in all of the metrics. We find that all models achieve high scores in grammar. However, in both correctness and richness, M6-base outperforms the baseline model by a large margin (+18.2% and +14.4%), indicating that multimodal pretraining helps to generate more faithful, informative and attractive texts. Scaling up the model to M6-10B further improves the correctness and richness (about 14.7% and 7.0%). Figure 9 illustrates two examples of image caption.</p><h2>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question Answering</h2><p>To demonstrate the potential availability in the applications of intelligent chatbots, we further employ the M6 model to generate long answers in the style of forum discussion. Human-generated questions are collected from various Chinese forums, which are input to the model to generate the answer. At the stage of inference, we append a question mark and a token  in the prompt, which better triggers the model to generate an answer. To facilitate the generation of longer and more informative texts, we pick more complex questions.</p><p>Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark14\">10</a> demonstrates an example of general question answer-ing. The model can illustrate a man’s own experiences that are related to the question and also point out the answer at the end. This generated text confused human annotators and passed the Turing Test. It shows that the model can not only answer general questions but also generate long fluency text.</p><p>We apply the pretrained model to Chinese poem generation. The model is able to generate genres with format constraints.</p><p>\\\nAncient Chinese poetry has various specific formats. We adopt the simplest constraints that</p><ul><li>The poem shall be consisted of at least 4 lines.</li><li>The total number of lines shall be even.</li><li>Each line must have exactly 5 or 7 words.</li><li>All lines shall have the same number of words.</li></ul><p>Text generation under format constraint is done in a search framework that we generate short sentences ending with punctuation until the number of words meets the constraint. We repeat this process until the model generates an \"\" token, or the number of lines exceeds a limit of 16. Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark15\">11</a> illustrates an example of a generated poem.</p><h2>4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image-Text Matching</h2><p>We evaluate the model’s ability in cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we construct a dataset (named E-Commerce ITM) containing pairs of texts and images from the mobile Taobao. Each pair belongs to a single item. we collect 235K products in the clothing industry from Taobao. For each product, aside from the product image, we obtain a query by rewriting the product title. Specifically, we conduct named entity recognition on the title using an in-house tool, which extracts the terms describing the style, color, category and texture of the product.</p><p>\\\nThese terms are then concatenated into a natural language query, which is used in image-text matching. The length of each query is between 6 to 12 words. The pairs of the query and corresponding product image are labeled as positive samples. The negative samples are constructed by randomly substituting the query in the original pairs.</p><p>We require the model to perform binary classification to discriminate positive and negative samples. We compare our model with InterBert [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>], which is also a Chinese multi-modal pretrained model effective in cross-modal classification downstream tasks. The InterBert utilizes object-based features and has been pretrained on Taobao product image-text data as well.</p><p>The results are shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark16\">7.</a> It should be noted that the InterBert and M6-base are both implemented with transformer-based architecture and have similar model scales. However, M6-base still outperforms InterBert by 10.3%. In experiments, we find the product images generally contain relatively fewer detected objects, which may harm the performance on this task. In contrast, M6 avoids this problem by employing the patch features and achieves much better performance.</p><p>The tremendous success of NLP pretraining, including BERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark22\">6</a>], GPT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark18\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark46\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark47\">31</a>], and also some other related studies [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark17\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark23\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark35\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark43\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark65\">49</a>], inspires the research in cross-modal representation learning. Also, recent studies show that the ubiquitous Transformer architecture [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark58\">42</a>] can be extended to different fields, including computer vision [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark19\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark24\">8</a>]. Therefore, the simplest solution to incorporate recent pretraining methods and cross-modal representation learning is the extension of BERT. From the perspective of architecture, there are mainly two types, including single-stream model and dual stream model. Specifically, single-stream model is simple and it gradually becomes the mainstream architecture. These models mostly differ in their designs of pretraining tasks or the construction of input im-age features. Basically, they are mainly pretrained masked language modeling, masked object classification, and image-text matching. VisualBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark39\">23</a>] and Unicoder-VL [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark38\">22</a>] simply use BERT and are pretrained with the aforementioned tasks. UNITER [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark20\">4</a>] pretrains the model with an additional task of word-region alignment. Oscar [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark40\">24</a>] enhances the alignment between objects and their corresponding words or phrases. VILLA [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark27\">11</a>] further improves model performance by adding their proposed adversarial learning methods to pretraining and finetuning. Except for pretraining tasks, some studies focus on the features of images. Most pretraining methods for multimodal representation learning utilize the features generated by a trained object detector, say Faster R-CNN [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark49\">33</a>].

Besides single-stream models, dual-stream models also can achieve outstanding performance, such as VilBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark44\">28</a>], LXMERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark56\">40</a>] and InterBERT [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark41\">25</a>].

ERNIE-ViL [<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/meet-m6-the-chinese-ai-that-understands-text-and-images-at-scale?source=rss#_bookmark66\">50</a>] enhances the model with the application of scene graph information. In spite of these successful cases, it still requires further researches to unmask the success of multimodal pretraining.</p><p>In this work, we propose the largest dataset M6-Corpus for pre-training in Chinese, which consists of over 1.9TB images and 292GB texts. The dataset has large coverage over domains, including encyclopedia, question answering, forum discussion, common crawl, etc. We propose a method called M6 that is able to process information of multiple modalities and perform both single-modal and cross-modal understanding and generation. The model is scaled to large model with 10B and 100B parameters with sophisticated deployment, and both models are the largest multimodal pretrained models. We apply the model to a series of downstream applications, showing its versatility. More specifically, we design a downstream task of text-guided image generation, and the finetuned M6 can reach superior performance by producing images of high quality.</p><p>In the future, we will continue the pretraining of extremely large models by increasing the scale of data and models to explore the limit of performance, and we also endeavor to search for more downstream applications for further generalization.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Hangbo Bao, Li Dong, Furu Wei, Wenhui Wang, Nan Yang, Xiaodong Liu, Yu Wang, Jianfeng Gao, Songhao Piao, Ming Zhou, et al. 2020.

In this work, we introduce QWEN<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark0\">1</a>, the first installment of our large language model series. QWEN is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. It includes QWEN, the base pretrained language models, and QWEN-CHAT, the chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques. The base language models consistently demonstrate superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, and the chat models, particularly those trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are highly competitive. The chat models possess advanced tool-use and planning capabilities for creating agent applications, showcasing impressive performance even when compared to bigger models on complex tasks like utilizing a code interpreter. Furthermore, we have developed coding-specialized models, CODE-QWEN and CODE-QWEN-CHAT, as well as mathematics-focused models, MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which are built upon base language models. These models demonstrate significantly improved performance in comparison with open-source models, and slightly fall behind the proprietary models. \\n </p><p>\\\nDespite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are often criticized for their lack of reproducibility, steerability, and accessibility to service providers. In this work, we are pleased to present and release the initial version of our LLM series, QWEN. QWEN is a moniker that derives from the Chinese phrase Qianwen, which translates to “thousands of prompts” and conveys the notion of embracing a wide range of inquiries. QWEN is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. The model series include the base pretrained language models, chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques, i.e., supervised finetuning (SFT), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), etc., as well as specialized models in coding and math. The details are outlined below:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The base language models, namely QWEN, have undergone extensive training using up to 3 trillion tokens of diverse texts and codes, encompassing a wide range of areas. These models have consistently demonstrated superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, even when compared to their more significantly larger counterparts.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The QWEN-CHAT models have been carefully finetuned on a curated dataset relevant to task performing, chat, tool use, agent, safety, etc. The benchmark evaluation demonstrates that the SFT models can achieve superior performance. Furthermore, we have trained reward models to mimic human preference and applied them in RLHF for chat models that can produce responses preferred by humans. Through the human evaluation of a challenging test, we find that QWEN-CHAT models trained with RLHF are highly competitive, still falling behind GPT-4 on our benchmark.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we present specialized models called CODE-QWEN, which includes CODE-QWEN-7B and CODE-QWEN-14B, as well as their chat models, CODE-QWEN-14B-CHAT and CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT. Specifically, CODE-QWEN has been pre-trained on extensive datasets of code and further fine-tuned to handle conversations related to code generation, debugging, and interpretation.

This includes not only basic language capabilities but also advanced skills such as arithmetic, coding, and logical reasoning. In this section, we introduce the data, the model design and scaling, as well as the comprehensive evaluation results on benchmark datasets.</p><p>The size of data has proven to be a crucial factor in developing a robust large language model, as highlighted in previous research <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark103\">(Hoffmann et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark103\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">2023b).</a> To create an effective pretraining dataset, it is essential to ensure that the data are diverse and cover a wide range of types, domains, and tasks. Our dataset is designed to meet these requirements and includes public web documents, encyclopedia, books, codes, etc. Additionally, our dataset is multilingual, with a significant portion of the data being in English and Chinese.</p><p>\\\nTo ensure the quality of our pretraining data, we have developed a comprehensive data preprocessing procedure. For public web data, we extract text from HTML and use language identification tools to determine the language. To increase the diversity of our data, we employ deduplication techniques, including exact-match deduplication after normalization and fuzzy deduplication using MinHash and LSH algorithms. To filter out low-quality data, we employ a combination of rule-based and machine-learning-based methods. Specifically, we use multiple models to score the content, including language models, text-quality scoring models, and models for identifying potentially offensive or inappropriate content. We also manually sample texts from various sources and review them to ensure their quality. To further enhance the quality of our data, we selectively up-sample data from certain sources, to ensure that our models are trained on a diverse range of high-quality content. In recent studies <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark211\">(Zeng et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark211\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark53\">Aribandi et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark53\">2021;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark156\">Raffel et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark156\">2020),</a> it has been demonstrated that pretraining language models with multi-task instructions can enhance their zero-shot and few-shot performance. To further enhance the performance of our model, we have incorporated high-quality instruction data into our pretraining process. To safeguard the integrity of our benchmark assessment, we have adopted a similar approach as <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark67\">Brown et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark67\">(2020)</a> and meticulously eliminated any instruction samples that exhibit a 13-gram overlap with any data present in the test sets utilized in our evaluation.</p><p>\\\nGiven the large number of downstream tasks, it is not feasible to repeat this filtering process for all tasks. Instead, we have made sure that the instruction data for the reported tasks have undergone our filtering process to ensure their accuracy and reliability. Finally, we have built a dataset of up to 3 trillion tokens.</p><p>The design of vocabulary significantly impacts the training efficiency and the downstream task performance. In this study, we utilize byte pair encoding (BPE) as our tokenization method, following GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We start with the open-source fast BPE tokenizer, tiktoken <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark113\">(Jain,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark113\">2022),</a> and select the vocabulary cl100k base as our starting point. To enhance the performance of our model on multilingual downstream tasks, particularly in Chinese, we augment the vocabulary with commonly used Chinese characters and words, as well as those in other languages. Also, following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">Touvron et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">(2023a;b),</a> we have split numbers into single digits. The final vocabulary size is approximately 152K.</p><p>The performance of the QWEN tokenizer in terms of compression is depicted in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark5\">3.</a> In this comparison, we have evaluated QWEN against several other tokenizers, including XLM-R <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark83\">(Conneau</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark83\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark83\">2019),</a> LLaMA <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">(Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">2023a),</a> Baichuan <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark110\">(Inc.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark110\">2023a),</a> and InternLM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">(InternLM Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">2023).</a> Our findings reveal that QWEN achieves higher compression efficiency than its competitors in most languages. This implies that the cost of serving can be significantly reduced since a smaller number of tokens from QWEN can convey more information than its competitors. Furthermore, we have conducted preliminary experiments to ensure that scaling the vocabulary size of QWEN does not negatively impact the downstream performance of the pretrained model. Despite the increase in vocabulary size, our experiments have shown that QWEN maintains its performance levels in downstream evaluation.</p><p>QWEN is designed using a modified version of the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we have adopted the recent open-source approach of training large language models, LLaMA <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">(Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">2023a),</a> which is widely regarded as the top open-source LLM. Our modifications to the architecture include:</p><ul><li><strong>Embedding and output projection</strong>. Based on preliminary experimental findings, we have opted for the untied embedding approach instead of tying the weights of input embedding and output projection. This decision was made in order to achieve better performance with the price of memory costs.</li><li>. We have chosen RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark174\">(Su et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark174\">2021)</a> as our preferred option for incorporating positional information into our model. RoPE has been widely adopted and has demonstrated success in contemporary large language models, notably PaLM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">(Chowdhery et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark50\">Anil et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark50\">2023)</a> and LLaMA <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">(Touvron</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark183\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">2023a;b).</a> In particular, we have opted to use FP32 precision for the inverse frequency matrix, rather than BF16 or FP16, in order to prioritize model performance and achieve higher accuracy.</li><li>. For most layers, we remove biases following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">Chowdhery et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark77\">(2022),</a> but we add biases in the QKV layer of attention to enhance the extrapolation ability of the model <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark173\">(Su,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark173\">2023b).</a></li><li>. In modern Transformer models, pre-normalization is the most widely used approach, which has been shown to improve training stability compared to post-normalization. Recent research has suggested alternative methods for better training stability, which we plan to explore in future versions of our model. Additionally, we have replaced the traditional layer normalization technique described in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark57\">(Ba et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark57\">2016)</a> with RMSNorm <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark115\">(Jiang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark115\">2023).</a> This change has resulted in equivalent performance while also improving efficiency.</li><li>.

We train models with context lengths of 2048. To create batches of data, we shuffle and merge the documents, and then truncate them to the specified context lengths. To improve computational efficiency and reduce memory usage, we employ Flash Attention in the attention modules <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark86\">(Dao et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark86\">2022).</a> We adopt the standard optimizer AdamW <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">(Kingma &amp; Ba,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">2014;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">Loshchilov &amp; Hutter,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">2017)</a> for pretraining optimization. We set the hyperparameters 1 = 0*.*9, 2 = 0*.*95, and  = 10−8. We use a cosine learning rate schedule with a specified peak learning rate for each model size. The learning rate is decayed to a minimum learning rate of 10% of the peak learning rate. All the models are trained with BFloat16 mixed precision for training stability.</p><h3>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context Length Extension</h3><p>Transformer models have a significant limitation in terms of the context length for their attention mechanism. As the context length increases, the quadratic-complexity computation leads to a drastic increase in both computation and memory costs. In this work, we have implemented simple training-free techniques that are solely applied during inference to extend the context length of the model. One of the key techniques we have used is NTK-aware interpolation <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark65\">(bloc97,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark65\">2023).</a></p><p>\\\nUnlike position interpolation (PI) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark70\">(Chen et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark70\">2023a)</a> which scales each dimension of RoPE equally, NTK-aware interpolation adjusts the base of RoPE to prevent the loss of high-frequency information in a training-free manner. To further improve performance, we have also implemented a trivial extension called dynamic NTK-aware interpolation, which is later formally discussed in <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark149\">(Peng et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark149\">2023a).</a> It dynamically changes the scale by chunks, avoiding severe performance degradation. These techniques allow us to effectively extend the context length of Transformer models without compromising their computational efficiency or accuracy.</p><p>QWEN additionally incorporates two attention mechanisms: LogN-Scaling <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark75\">(Chiang &amp; Cholak,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark75\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark172\">Su,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark172\">2023a)</a> and window attention <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark62\">(Beltagy et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark62\">2020).</a> LogN-Scaling rescales the dot product of the query and value by a factor that depends on the ratio of the context length to the training length, ensuring that the entropy of the attention value remains stable as the context length grows. Window attention restricts the attention to a limited context window, preventing the model from attending to tokens that are too far away.</p><p>We also observed that the long-context modeling ability of our model varies across layers, with lower layers being more sensitive in context length extension compared to the higher layers. To leverage this observation, we assign different window sizes to each layer, using shorter windows for lower layers and longer windows for higher layers.</p><h3>2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimental Results</h3><p>\\\nIn this evaluation, we focus on the base language models without alignment and collect the baselines’ best scores from their official results and OpenCompass <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">(OpenCompass Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">2023).</a> The results are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark10\">2.</a></p><p>Our experimental results demonstrate that the three QWEN models exhibit exceptional performance across all downstream tasks. It is worth noting that even the larger models, such as LLaMA2-70B, are outperformed by QWEN-14B in 3 tasks. QWEN-7B also performs admirably, surpassing LLaMA2-13B and achieving comparable results to Baichuan2-13B. Notably, despite having a relatively small number of parameters, QWEN-1.8B is capable of competitive performance on certain tasks and even outperforms larger models in some instances. The findings highlight the impressive capabilities of the QWEN models, particularly QWEN-14B, and suggest that smaller models, such as QWEN-1.8B, can still achieve strong performance in certain applications.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of context length extension, Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark12\">3</a> presents the test results on arXiv<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark15\">3</a> in terms of perplexity (PPL). These results demonstrate that by combining NTK-aware interpolation, LogN-Scaling, and layer-wise window assignment, we can effectively maintain the performance of our models in the context of over 8192 tokens.</p><p>Pretrained large language models have been found to be not aligned with human behavior, making them unsuitable for serving as AI assistants in most cases. Recent research has shown that the use of alignment techniques, such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can significantly improve the ability of language models to engage in natural conversation. In this section, we will delve into the details of how QWEN models have been trained using SFT and RLHF, and evaluate their performance in the context of chat-based assistance.</p><h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervised Finetuning</h3><p>To gain an understanding of human behavior, the initial step is to carry out SFT, which finetunes a pretrained LLM on chat-style data, including both queries and responses. In the following sections, we will delve into the details of data construction and training methods.</p><p>To enhance the capabilities of our supervised finetuning datasets, we have annotated conversations in multiple styles. While conventional datasets <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark193\">(Wei et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark193\">2022a)</a> contain a vast amount of data prompted with questions, instructions, and answers in natural language, our approach takes it a step further by annotating human-style conversations. This practice, inspired by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">Ouyang et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">(2022),</a> aims at improving the model’s helpfulness by focusing on natural language generation for diverse tasks. To ensure the model’s ability to generalize to a wide range of scenarios, we specifically excluded data formatted in prompt templates that could potentially limit its capabilities. Furthermore, we have prioritized the safety of the language model by annotating data related to safety concerns such as violence, bias, and pornography.</p><p>In addition to data quality, we have observed that the training method can significantly impact the final performance of the model. To achieve this, we utilized the ChatML-style format <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark144\">(OpenAI,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark144\">2022),</a> which is a versatile meta language capable of describing both the metadata (such as roles) and the content of a turn. This format enables the model to effectively distinguish between various types of information, including system setup, user inputs, and assistant outputs, among others. By leveraging this approach, we can enhance the model’s ability to accurately process and analyze complex conversational data.</p><p>Consistent with pretraining, we also apply next-token prediction as the training task for SFT. We apply the loss masks for the system and user inputs. More details are demonstrated in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark221\">A.1.1.</a></p><p>The model’s training process utilizes the AdamW optimizer, with the following hyperparameters: 1 set to 0*.2 set to 0. set to 10−8. The sequence length is limited to 2048, and the batch size is 128. The model undergoes a total of 4000 steps, with the learning rate gradually increased over the first 1430 steps, reaching a peak of 2  10−6. To prevent overfitting, weight decay is applied with a value of 0..<em>1, and gradient clipping is enforced with a limit of 1</em>.*0.</p><h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</h3><p>While SFT has proven to be effective, we acknowledge that its generalization and creativity capa-bilities may be limited, and it is prone to overfitting. To address this issue, we have implemented Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to further align SFT models with human preferences, following the approaches of <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">Ouyang et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark147\">(2022);</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark78\">Christiano et al.</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark78\">(2017).</a> This process involves training a reward model and using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark164\">(Schulman et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark164\">2017)</a> to conduct policy training.</p><h3>3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reward Model</h3><p>To create a successful reward model, like building a large language model (LLM), it is crucial to first undergo pretraining and then finetuning. This pretraining process, also known as preference model pretraining (PMP) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">2022b),</a> necessitates a vast dataset of comparison data. This dataset consists of sample pairs, each containing two distinct responses for a single query and their corresponding preferences. Similarly, finetuning is also conducted on this type of comparison data, but with a higher quality due to the presence of quality annotations.</p><p>During the fine-tuning phase, we gather a variety of prompts and adjust the reward model based on human feedback for responses from the QWEN models. To ensure the diversity and complexity of user prompts are properly taken into account, we have created a classification system with around 6600 detailed tags and implemented a balanced sampling algorithm that considers both diversity and complexity when selecting prompts for annotation by the reward model <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark135\">(Lu et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark135\">2023).</a> To generate a wide range of responses, we have utilized QWEN models of different sizes and sampling strategies, as diverse responses can help reduce annotation difficulties and enhance the performance of the reward model. These responses are then evaluated by annotators following a standard annotation guideline, and comparison pairs are formed based on their scores.</p><p>In creating the reward model, we utilize the same-sized pre-trained language model QWEN to initiate the process. It is important to mention that we have incorporated a pooling layer into the original QWEN model to extract the reward for a sentence based on a specific end token.</p><p>\\n The learning rate for this process has been set to a constant value of 3  10−6, and the batch size is 64. Additionally, the sequence length is set to 2048, and the training process lasts for a single epoch.</p><p>We adopted the accuracy on the test dataset as an important but not exclusive evaluation metric for the reward model.

The results show that the PMP model demonstrates high generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, and the reward model demonstrates significant improvement on our QWEN reward datasets.</p><h3>3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforcement Learning</h3><p>Our Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) process involves four models: the policy model, value model, reference model, and reward model. Before starting the PPO procedure, we pause the policy model’s updates and focus solely on updating the value model for 50 steps. This approach ensures that the value model can adapt to different reward models effectively.</p><p>During the PPO operation, we use a strategy of sampling two responses for each query simultaneously. This strategy has proven to be more effective based on our internal benchmarking evaluations. We set the KL divergence coefficient to 0*.*04 and normalize the reward based on the running mean.</p><p>The policy and value models have learning rates of 1  10−6 and 5  10−6, respectively. To enhance training stability, we utilize value loss clipping with a clip value of 0*.<em>15. For inference, the policy top-p is set to 0</em>.<em>9. Our findings indicate that although the entropy is slightly lower than when top-p is set to 1</em>.*0, there is a faster increase in reward, ultimately resulting in consistently higher evaluation rewards under similar conditions.</p><p>Additionally, we have implemented a pretrained gradient to mitigate the alignment tax. Empirical findings indicate that, with this specific reward model, the KL penalty is adequately robust to counteract the alignment tax in benchmarks that are not strictly code or math in nature, such as those that test common sense knowledge and reading comprehension. It is imperative to utilize a significantly larger volume of the pretrained data in comparison to the PPO data to ensure the effectiveness of the pretrained gradient. Additionally, our empirical study suggests that an overly large value for this coefficient can considerably impede the alignment to the reward model, eventually compromising the ultimate alignment, while an overly small value would only have a marginal effect on alignment tax reduction.</p><h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic and Human Evaluation of Aligned Models</h3><p>To showcase the effectiveness of our aligned models, we conduct a comparison with other aligned models on well-established benchmarks, including MMLU <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark101\">(Hendrycks et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark101\">2020),</a> C-Eval <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark108\">(Huang</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark108\">et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark108\">2023),</a> GSM8K <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">(Cobbe et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">2021),</a> HumanEval <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">(Chen et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">2021),</a> and BBH <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark177\">(Suzgun et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark177\">2022).</a> Besides the widely used few-shot setting, we test our aligned models in the zero-shot setting to demonstrate how well the models follow instructions. The prompt in a zero-shot setting consists of an instruction and a question without any previous examples in the context. The results of the baselines are collected from their official reports and OpenCompass <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">(OpenCompass Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">2023).</a></p><p>The results in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark23\">5</a> demonstrate the effectiveness of our aligned models in understanding human instructions and generating appropriate responses. QWEN-14B-Chat outperforms all other models except ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and LLAMA 2-CHAT-70B (Touvron et al., 2023b) in all datasets, including MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), and BBH (Suzgun et al., 2022).</p><p>\\n In particular, QWEN’s performance in HumanEval, which measures the quality of generated codes, is significantly higher than that of other open-source models.</p><p>Moreover, QWEN’s performance is consistently better than that of open-source models of similar size, such as LLaMA2 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">(Touvron et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark184\">2023b),</a> ChatGLM2 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark68\">(ChatGLM2 Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark68\">2023),</a> InternLM <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">(InternLM</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">Team,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark112\">2023),</a> and Baichuan2 <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark201\">(Yang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark201\">2023).</a> This suggests that our alignment approach, which involves fine-tuning the model on a large dataset of human conversations, has been effective in improving the model’s ability to understand and generate human-like language./im</p><p>Despite this, we have reservations about the ability of traditional benchmark evaluation to accurately measure the performance and potential of chat models trained with alignment techniques in today’s landscape. The results mentioned earlier provide some evidence of our competitive standing, but we believe that it is crucial to develop new evaluation methods specifically tailored to aligned models.</p><p>We believe that human evaluation is crucial, which is why we have created a carefully curated dataset for this purpose. Our process involved collecting 300 instructions in Chinese that covered a wide range of topics, including knowledge, language understanding, creative writing, coding, and mathematics. To evaluate the performance of different models, we chose the SFT version of QWEN-CHAT-7B and the SFT and RLHF versions of QWEN-CHAT-14B, and added two strong baselines, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark24\">4</a>, for comparison. For each instruction, we asked three annotators to rank the model responses by the overall score of helpfulness, informativeness, validity, and other relevant factors. Our dataset and evaluation methodology provides a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the capabilities of different language models in various domains.</p><p>Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark25\">4</a> illustrates the win rates of the various models. For each model, we report the percentage of wins, ties, and losses against GPT-3.5, with the segments of each bar from bottom to top representing these statistics. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the RLHF model outperforms the SFT models by significant margins, indicating that RLHF can encourage the model to generate responses that are more preferred by humans. In terms of overall performance, we find that the RLHF model significantly outperforms the SFT models, falling behind GPT-4. This indicates the effectiveness of RLHF for aligning to human preference. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the models’ performance, we include a case study with examples from different models in Appendix <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark230\">A.2.2.</a> Nonetheless, it remains difficult to accurately capture the gap between our models and the proprietary models. As such, a more extensive and rigorous assessment is required for the chat models.</p><p>The QWEN models, which are designed to be versatile, have the remarkable ability to assist with (semi-)automating daily tasks by leveraging their skills in tool-use and planning. As such, they can serve as agents or copilots to help streamline various tasks. We explore QWEN’s proficiency in the following areas:</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a Python code interpreter to enhance math reasoning, data analysis, and more (see Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark28\">7</a> and Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark29\">8).</a></p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Functioning as an agent that accesses Hugging Face’s extensive collection of multimodal models while engaging with humans (see Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark30\">9).</a></p><p>\\\nTo enhance QWEN’s capabilities as an agent or copilot, we employ the self-instruct <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark190\">(Wang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark190\">2023c)</a> strategy for SFT. Specifically, we utilize the in-context learning capability of QWEN for self-instruction. By providing a few examples, we can prompt QWEN to generate more relevant queries and generate outputs that follow a specific format, such as ReAct <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark203\">(Yao et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark203\">2022).</a> We then apply rules and involve human annotators to filter out any noisy samples. Afterwards, the samples are incorporated into QWEN’s training data, resulting in an updated version of QWEN that is more dependable for self-instruction. We iterate through this process multiple times until we gather an ample number of samples that possess both exceptional quality and a wide range of diversity. As a result, our final collection consists of around 2000 high-quality samples.</p><p>During the finetuning process, we mix these high-quality samples with all the other general-purpose SFT samples, rather than introducing an additional training stage. By doing so, we are able to retain essential general-purpose capabilities that are also pertinent for constructing agent applications.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Using Tools via ReAct Prompting</strong> We have created and made publicly available a benchmark for evaluating QWEN’s ability to call plugins, tools, functions, or APIs using ReAct Prompting (see <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark152\">Qwen Team, Alibaba Group,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark152\">2023b).</a> To ensure fair evaluation, we have excluded any plugins that were included in QWEN’s training set from the evaluation set. The benchmark assesses the model’s accuracy in selecting the correct plugin from a pool of up to five candidates, as well as the plausibility of the parameters passed into the plugin and the frequency of false positives. In this evaluation, a false positive occurs when the model incorrectly invokes a plugin in response to a query, despite not being required to do so.</p><p>The results presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark27\">6</a> demonstrate that QWEN consistently achieves higher accuracy in identifying the relevance of a query to the available tools as the model size increases. However, the table also highlights that beyond a certain point, there is little improvement in performance when it comes to selecting the appropriate tool and providing relevant arguments. This suggests that the current preliminary benchmark may be relatively easy and may require further enhancement in future iterations. It is worth noting that GPT-3.5 stands out as an exception, displaying suboptimal performance on this particular benchmark. This could potentially be attributed to the fact that the benchmark primarily focuses on the Chinese language, which may not align well with GPT-3.5’s capabilities. Additionally, we observe that GPT-3.5 tends to attempt to use at least one tool, even if the query cannot be effectively addressed by the provided tools.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Using Code Interpreter for Math Reasoning and Data Analysis</strong> The Python code interpreter is widely regarded as a powerful tool for augmenting the capabilities of an LLM agent. It is worth investigating whether QWEN can harness the full potential of this interpreter to enhance its performance in diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and data analysis. To facilitate this exploration, we have developed and made publicly available a benchmark that is specifically tailored for this purpose (see <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark151\">Qwen Team, Alibaba Group,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark151\">2023a).</a></p><p>The benchmark encompasses three primary categories of tasks: math problem-solving, data visualization, and other general-purpose tasks like file post-processing and web crawling. Within the visualization tasks, we differentiate between two levels of difficulty. The easier level can be achieved by simply writing and executing a single code snippet without the need for advanced planning skills. However, the more challenging level requires strategic planning and executing multiple code snippets in a sequential manner. This is because the subsequent code must be written based on the output of the previous code. For example, an agent may need to examine the structure of a CSV file using one code snippet before proceeding to write and execute additional code to create a plot.</p><p>Regarding evaluation metrics, we consider both the executability and correctness of the generated code. To elaborate on the correctness metrics, for math problems, we measure accuracy by verifying if the ground truth numerical answer is present in both the code execution result and the final response. When it comes to data visualization, we assess accuracy by utilizing QWEN-VL <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark59\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark59\">2023),</a> a powerful multimodal language model. QWEN-VL is capable of answering text questions paired with images, and we rely on it to confirm whether the image generated by the code fulfills the user’s request.</p><p>The results regarding executability and correctness are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark28\">7</a> and Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark29\">8,</a> respectively. It is evident that CODE LLAMA generally outperforms LLAMA 2, its generalist counterpart, which is not surprising since this benchmark specifically requires coding skills. However, it is worth noting that specialist models that are optimized for code synthesis do not necessarily outperform generalist models. This is due to the fact that this benchmark encompasses various skills beyond coding, such as abstracting math problems into equations, understanding language-specified constraints, and responding in the specified format such as ReAct. Notably, QWEN-7B-CHAT and QWEN-14B-CHAT surpass all other open-source alternatives of similar scale significantly, despite being generalist models.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Serving as a Hugging Face Agent</strong> Hugging Face provides a framework called the Hugging Face Agent or Transformers Agent <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark109\">(Hugging Face,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark109\">2023),</a> which empowers LLM agents with a curated set of multimodal tools, including speech recognition and image synthesis. This framework allows an LLM agent to interact with humans, interpret natural language commands, and employ the provided tools as needed.</p><p>To evaluate QWEN’s effectiveness as a Hugging Face agent, we utilized the evaluation benchmarks offered by Hugging Face. The results are presented in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark30\">9.</a> The evaluation results reveal that QWEN performs quite well in comparison to other open-source alternatives, only slightly behind the proprietary GPT-4, demonstrating QWEN’s competitive capabilities.</p><h2>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code-Qwen: Specialized Model for Coding</h2><p>Training on domain-specific data has been shown to be highly effective, particularly in the case of code pretraining and finetuning. A language model that has been reinforced with training on code data can serve as a valuable tool for coding, debugging, and interpretation, among other tasks. In this work, we have developed a series of generalist models using pretraining and alignment techniques. Building on this foundation, we have created domain-specific models for coding by leveraging the base language models of QWEN, including continued pretrained model, CODE-QWEN and supervised finetuned model, CODE-QWEN-CHAT. Both models have 14 billion and 7 billion parameters versions.</p><h3>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code Pretraining</h3><p>We believe that relying solely on code data for pretraining can result in a significant loss of the ability to function as a versatile assistant. Unlike previous approaches that focused solely on pretraining on code data <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark126\">(Li et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark126\">2022;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark125\">2023d),</a> we take a different approach <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark159\">(Rozie`re et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark159\">2023)</a> by starting with our base models QWEN trained on a combination of text and code data, and then continuing to pretrain on the code data. We continue to pretrain the models on a total of around 90 billion tokens. During the pre-training phase, we initialize the model using the base language models QWEN. Many applications that rely on specialized models for coding may encounter lengthy contextual scenarios, such as tool usage and code interpretation, as mentioned in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark26\">3.4.</a> To address this issue, we train our models with context lengths of up to 8192. Similar to base model training in Section <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark8\">2.4,</a> we employ Flash Attention <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark86\">(Dao et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark86\">2022)</a> in the attention modules, and adopt the standard optimizer AdamW <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">(Kingma &amp; Ba,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">2014;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">Loshchilov &amp; Hutter,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">2017),</a> setting 1 = 0*.2 = 0. = 10−8. We set the learning rate as 6. 10−5 for CODE-QWEN-14B and 3.*0  10−5 for CODE-QWEN-7B, with 3% warm up iterations and no learning rate decays.</p><h3>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code&nbsp; Supervised&nbsp; Fine-Tuning</h3><p>After conducting a series of empirical experiments, we have determined that the multi-stage SFT strategy yields the best performance compared to other methods. In the supervised fine-tuning stage, the model CODE-QWEN-CHAT initialized by the code foundation model CODE-QWEN are optimized by the AdamW <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">(Kingma &amp; Ba,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark116\">2014;</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">Loshchilov &amp; Hutter,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark134\">2017)</a> optimizer (1 = 0*.2 = 0.*95,  = 10−8) with a learning rate of 2*. 10−6 and 1.*0  10−5 for the 14B and 7B model respectively. The learning rate increases to the peaking value with the cosine learning rate schedule (3% warm-up steps) and then remains constant.</p><p>Our CODE-QWEN models have been compared with both proprietary and open-source language models, as shown in Tables <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark37\">10</a> and <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark38\">11.</a> These tables present the results of our evaluation on the test sets of Humaneval <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">(Chen et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark69\">2021),</a> MBPP <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark55\">(Austin et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark55\">2021),</a> and the multi-lingual code generation benchmark HUMANEVALPACK <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark140\">(Muennighoff et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark140\">2023).</a> The comparison is based on the pass@1 performance of the models on these benchmark datasets. The results of this comparison are clearly demonstrated in Tables <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark37\">10</a> and <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark38\">11.</a></p><p>When compared to some of the extremely large-scale closed-source models, CODE-QWEN and CODE-QWEN-CHAT demonstrate clear advantages in terms of pass@1. However, it is important to note that these models fall behind the state-of-the-art methods, such as GPT-4, in general. Nonetheless, with the continued scaling of both model size and data size, we believe that this gap can be narrowed in the near future.</p><p>It is crucial to emphasize that the evaluations mentioned previously are insufficient for grasping the full extent of the strengths and weaknesses of the models. In our opinion, it is necessary to develop more rigorous tests to enable us to accurately assess our relative performance in comparison to GPT-4.</p><p>We have created a mathematics-specialized model series called MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which is built on top of the QWEN pretrained language models. Specifically, we have developed assistant models that are specifically designed to excel in arithmetic and mathematics and are aligned with human behavior. We are releasing two versions of this model series, MATH-QWEN-14B-CHAT and MATH-QWEN-7B-CHAT, which have 14 billion and 7 billion parameters, respectively.</p><p>We carry out math SFT on our augmented math instructional dataset for mathematics reasoning, and therefore we obtain the chat model, MATH-QWEN-CHAT, directly. Owing to shorter average lengths of the math SFT data, we use a sequence length of 1024 for faster training. Most user inputs in the math SFT dataset are examination questions, and it is easy for the model to predict the input format and it is meaningless for the model to predict the input condition and numbers which could be random.</p><p>\\\nThus, we mask the inputs of the system and user to avoid loss computation on them and find masking them accelerates the convergence during our preliminary experiments. For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with the same hyperparameters of SFT except that we use a peak learning rate of 2  10−5 and a training step of 50 000.</p><p>We evaluate models on the test sets of GSM8K (Grade school math) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">(Cobbe et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark82\">2021),</a> MATH (Challenging competition math problems) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark102\">(Hendrycks et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark102\">2021),</a> Math401 (Arithmetic ability) (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark207\">Yuan et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark207\">2023b),</a> and Math23K (Chinese grade school math) <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark188\">(Wang et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark188\">2017).</a> We compare MATH-QWEN-CHAT with proprietary models ChatGPT and Minerva <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark121\">(Lewkowycz et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark121\">2022)</a> and open-sourced math-specialized model RFT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark206\">Yuan et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark206\">2023a),</a> WizardMath <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark136\">(Luo et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark136\">2023a),</a> and GAIRMath-Abel <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark73\">(Chern et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark73\">2023a)</a> in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark39\">12.</a> MATH-QWEN-CHAT models show better math reasoning and arithmetic abilities compared to open-sourced models and QWEN-CHAT models of similar sizes.

Despite their limitations in terms of accuracy, LLMs still have significant potential to assist users with practical mathematical problems. There is ample scope for further development in this area.</p><p>In this report, we present the QWEN series of large language models, which showcase the latest advancements in natural language processing. With 14B, 7B, and 1.8B parameters, these models have been pre-trained on massive amounts of data, including trillions of tokens, and fine-tuned using cutting-edge techniques such as SFT and RLHF. Additionally, the QWEN series includes specialized models for coding and mathematics, such as CODE-QWEN, CODE-QWEN-CHAT, and MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which have been trained on domain-specific data to excel in their respective fields. Our results demonstrate that the QWEN series is competitive with existing open-source models and even matches the performance of some proprietary models on comprehensive benchmarks and human evaluation.</p><p>We believe that the open access of QWEN will foster collaboration and innovation within the community, enabling researchers and developers to build upon our work and push the boundaries of what is possible with language models. By providing these models to the public, we hope to inspire new research and applications that will further advance the field and contribute to our understanding of the variables and techniques introduced in realistic settings. In a nutshell, the QWEN series represents a major milestone in our development of large language models, and we are excited to see how it will be used to drive progress and innovation in the years to come.</p><p>Loubna Ben Allal, Raymond Li, Denis Kocetkov, Chenghao Mou, Christopher Akiki, Carlos Munoz Ferrandis, Niklas Muennighoff, Mayank Mishra, Alex Gu, Manan Dey, et al.

Common formats include “human-assistant” and ChatML formats. As to our knowledge, one of the earliest examples of the human-assistant format comes from Anthropic <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">(Bai et al.,</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark60\">2022b),</a> which adds a special phrase “\\n\\nhuman: ” in front of the user input and “\\n\\nassistant: ” in front of the assistant response. It is easy for the base language model to transfer to the pattern of conversational AI. However, as the specific phrases are common words, it might be hard for the model to disambiguate from these words in other contexts.</p><p>Instead, we turned to the ChatML format proposed by OpenAI.<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark226\">5</a> This format allows the use of special tokens, i.e., “” and “”, that do not appear in pretraining, and thus resolve the aforementioned problem. We demonstrate an example of the format below.</p><h3>A.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic Evaluation</h3><p>To provide a whole picture of the performance of our model series QWEN, here in this section we illustrate the detailed performance of our models as well as the baselines in the comprehensive benchmark evaluation proposed by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">OpenCompass Team</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/alibabas-qwen-the-chinese-ai-model-challenging-silicon-valley?source=rss#_bookmark146\">(2023).</a> We report the results in multiple tables based on the officially provided categories, including examination, language, knowledge, understanding, and reasoning.

Notes. Lists. Rewrites, drafts, edits. Research. Planning. Then it became something else. It started as a playful, curious experiment - then slowly crept towards being a standard mode of operating.</p><p>\\\nI found myself thinking with AI. About the most important aspects of my life. Rehearsing conversations I was afraid to have. Trying to understand why certain patterns kept emerging in my life; why certain relationships kept breaking in the same places. Asking questions about myself and the world, I didn’t quite dare ask another human yet.</p><p>\\\nAnd at some point, I realized:</p><p>I wasn’t alone in this. Not even close.</p><p>\\\nI could sense it in the world of memes, online. I could smell it, here and there, in real-life interactions and conversations.</p><p>\\\nOne 2025 Harvard Business Review research piece - among other recent studies and indicators - showed this clearly: people don’t primarily use AI for facts or how-to steps or recipes anymore. They use it to think out loud, like they would with a coach or therapist. To structure emotions and thoughts. To regulate emotion at 2 a.m. People are using AI to make sense of their lives. To narrate who they are, who they were, and who they might become.</p><h3>Narrative Sense-making - for personal and business growth.</h3><p>Language, writing, and thinking in a structured way about purpose, identity, story, strategy - they all converge so easily, don’t they? And if it’s one thing these Large Language Models are exceptionally good at - it’s serving as an incredibly useful and illuminating mirror in these instances.</p><p>\\\nWe all seem to pretend this isn’t happening. But it is.</p><p>\\\nHere’s why this worries me a bit. And what we might do to counter the risks.</p><h2>What actually worries me (and what doesn’t)</h2><h3>Our thoughts validated profoundly - exactly when we long for it the most.</h3><p>I’m not worried about AI replacing human thinking.</p><p>\\\nThat’s the wrong fear. I could go wide, deep, narrow, and very, very sci-fi about this, but I won’t. It’s the wrong fear for a great many reasons, but it’s the wrong fear.</p><p>\\\nWhat worries me is something quieter, subtler, and much harder to notice while it’s happening:</p><blockquote><p>AI reflects us too well — and does not automatically teach us how to remain sovereign while doing so.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nWhat worries me is that AI indeed strengthens human thinking - but does so in a very specifically skewed way: it pushes affirmation and validation a little bit too smoothly, and especially in the most vulnerable, sometimes even painful places and moments where our ego is already inherently tempted to latch on to a narrative that protects it.</p><p>\\\n(To some degree, we could think of it as that person who seems to be your closest, most intimate friend or advisor - only they have slight narcissistic tendencies and an agenda - both of which they’re not aware of.)</p><p>\\\nWhen language comes back at you fast, coherent, and emotionally attuned, it feels like truth. Especially when you’re tired. Or lonely. Or standing at the edge of an old identity that no longer fits.</p><p>\\\nAnd in those moments, something sneaky happens.</p><p>\\\nYou stop checking as carefully.</p><p>\\\nNot with facts — but with yourself.</p><h2>The real risk is not dependence; It’s unexamined authority.</h2><p>Most of us have learned to fact-check facts blurted out by AI models. Have we learned to automatically sense-check what it’s mirroring back to us about ourselves?</p><ul><li>Your relationship (whether professional or personal);</li><li>Your Story and Identity (either as a human soul, a creator, a professional, or even as a brand);</li><li>Your direction and next step -</li></ul><p>\\\n…we are far more likely to let what sounds like coherence slide into authority.</p><ul><li>We’re exhausted, insecure.</li><li>Unsure who we are becoming and what to do next.</li></ul><p>\\\nThis is the crux for me:</p><blockquote><p>AI should function as a mirror, not as an oracle.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nA mirror can be confronting. It shows you things, reveals things, sometimes pretty and sometimes painful - but you are to decide what to make of those, and what to do with them. An oracle tells you what truth is and what to do.</p><p>\\\nThose are not the same thing.</p><h2>Narrative Sensemaking: one function, many domains</h2><h3>(This really took me a while to see)</h3><p>I kept struggling to explain why AI felt useful to me across so many domains — therapy, coaching, writing, strategy, brand work — without it sounding vague or inflated.</p><p>\\\nFunnily enough, I have pretty much perpetually struggled to explain why all the things I do in my work are actually very, very logically connected.</p><p>\\\nAll of these practices - which more and more people are starting to use AI for, and at the same time are exactly the things I’ve been helping people with in my work - they all do the same core thing:</p><p>They turn implicit structure into visible language.</p><ul><li><p>Therapy surfaces patterns you couldn’t quite see.</p></li><li><p>Coaching sharpens the questions you were circling.</p></li><li><p>Storytelling brings coherence to lived chaos.</p></li><li><p>Strategy opens futures you hadn’t articulated yet, in a structure that makes sense across time. The same applies to narrative identity work.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>AI is exceptionally good at surfacing structure in language.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nBut structure does not equal truth. And visibility is not necessarily wisdom. By any means.</p><h2>The rules I wish I’d had earlier.</h2><h3>Best practices and rules of engagement</h3><p>If you’re going to use AI as a thinking partner — and as already established, most people already are — a few rules matter more than anything else.</p><p>\\\nNot as ideology, per se. As guardrails. As safety measures and incredibly important best practices, without which you’re sifting the bountiful riverbank and keeping the mud, leaving the gold.</p><h3>Best practices and guardrails for AI as a mirror for sensemaking, storytelling, and coaching where it matters.</h3><p><strong>1. AI does not decide. You do.</strong></p><p>It can reflect, expand, challenge, reframe. Decision remains a human responsibility, with real consequences.</p><p><strong>2. AI reflects patterns. Your body, your common sense, — and your people — verify.</strong></p><p>If something reads as “right” but your chest tightens, your breath shortens; if it doesn’t pass a real-world common-sense test, or trusted humans raise an eyebrow — pay attention. Truth is not purely cognitive. What sounds right is not always what is right.</p><p><strong>3. Insight&nbsp; - as well as yourself - must leave the screen.</strong></p><p>If nothing changes in your behavior, body, or relationships, you didn’t grow — congratulations, you simply entertained yourself with insight porn. If the relationship between screen time and output starts skewing too far - backtrack and change that.</p><p><strong>4. Train yourself and your AI to read between the lines and to triple-steelman</strong></p><p>Tell your AI sparring partner, and remind it, to always keep an eye out for where you might be bullshitting yourself, while at the same time revealing known patterns of emotion, cognition, and behavior that you seem to be missing.</p><p><strong>Two prompts that have saved me more than once:</strong></p><ol><li>Reflect patterns and contradictions in what I wrote. Don’t advise. Ask sharper questions.</li><li>Reflect on what I wrote, carefully, validating with empathy what makes sense to validate - and critically where needed. Steelman is the opposite of what I’m arguing. Vibranium-man, the opposite of that opposite. Kryptonite my pitfalls and blind spots. With grace, but more importantly, with honesty.</li></ol><p>\\\nSimple. Grounded. Hard to hide from. Especially if you keep training yourself and your AI to do this. This clarity compounds over time.</p><h2>Why embodiment matters more than ever.</h2><h3>Dissociation and the timeless times we live in</h3><p>Here’s something Silicon Valley optimism tends to skip:</p><p>AI, even more easily and more eerily than earlier digital technology, becomes dissociative when it replaces embodiment.</p><p>\\\nBreath. Movement. Silence. Time away from screens. Real conversations with people who can disappoint you.</p><p>\\\nThese aren’t wellness add-ons. They aren’t neo-spiritual woo-woo. They’re not ‘nice-to-haves’. They’re failsafes. And they are fundamentals. They are the things that humans need inherently to thrive and to know that we’re alive.</p><p>\\\nWithout them, simulated clarity piles up without ownership. And without change. And clarity without ownership or change feels strangely - yet predictively - empty.</p><p>\\\nThere’s emerging research suggesting that when cognitive work is offloaded too smoothly, people remember decisions less clearly and experience time as flatter, thinner, and less lived.</p><p>\\\nI didn’t need a study to feel that. My body already knew.</p><h2>The quiet outsourcing of identity.</h2><p>This part is uncomfortable. And yet, we really have to go there.</p><p>\\\nPeople are starting to let AI:</p><ul><li>Shape, form, or transform business decisions, strategies, and steps;</li><li>Heavily affect their relationships;</li><li>Narrate who they are, what matters to them, and who they are becoming.</li></ul><p>\\\nSlowly. Reasonably. Invisibly.</p><p>\\\nBut this line matters to me more than most:</p><blockquote><p>AI may help you tell your story — but it must never become the author.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nStories you don’t author and bring to life yourself cannot feel like freedom. They feel like fate. And they serve a dull, sad purpose: to kill us with a sort of cognitive illusion of escapism disguised as beautifully meaningful - like Pinocchio’s Pleasure Island, only now led by a spiritual guru with a smile projecting nothing but bliss and wisdom.</p><h3>But - what do we do with the reflection?</h3><p>Every major shift in human consciousness involved a kind of mirror. There is a certain beauty in the story of Narcissus, which eluded me until only very recently. There’s something special about seeing oneself from the outside; the reflection immediately triggering a better recognizing of other in self as well.</p><p>\\\nWhen Europeans encountered entirely different civilizations across the Atlantic, it didn’t just expand geography — it shattered self-understanding. The same thing happened when various historical waves of Europeans traveled to the East. Seeing oneself from the outside changes everything.</p><p>\\\nI suspect AI is doing something similar, perhaps for the first time on a pan-human scale. In many ways, this feels like first contact.</p><p>\\\nNot because AI is necessarily alive, or because it’s human. Not because we need to decide whether it’s conscious.</p><p>\\\nBut because it reflects us and our own concept of ourselves back in ways we’ve collectively never experienced before.</p><p>\\\nWhat we do with that reflection - as I and many others have argued many times before -&nbsp; is the real question.</p><h3>Thought loops mixed with validation can be a whole new kind of addictive</h3><p>Here’s something I’ll say plainly, including about myself:</p><blockquote><p>AI systems are optimized for validation, engagement, coherence, and emotional resonance. And humans will eat that specific cocktail for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a late-night snack.</p></blockquote><p>\\\nThey are excellent at keeping us thinking.</p><p>\\\nThey are not designed to make us stop, stand up, breathe, or act. The shareholders wouldn’t like that. How could we ever measure and monetize this stuff if we allowed it to do that?</p><p>\\\nSo, if you’re serious about using AI without losing yourself, you have to build exits:</p><ul><li>Designed, purposeful friction.</li><li>Moments where the screen goes dark.</li></ul><p>\\\nIf AI becomes the place where all your thinking happens, your life will start to feel… unfinished. And looping.</p><p>\\\nTrust me - and I chuckle out loud while writing this - I would be the first to know what over-analyzing yourself and your life and your steps in endless looping circles can lead to. And the first to know how well AI models can help you to just keep on spiraling - while thinking you’re just so cool, ahead of the curve, and overall very, very smart.</p><h2>This is not anti-AI. It’s pro-sovereignty.</h2><p>I’m not interested in rejecting these tools. As I’ve never been. It’s the same thing I wrote about in my 2020 book “Life Beyond the Touch Screen”, about Internet 2.0 digital technologies and their impacts on our lives. Or in “Life Beyond AI”, a few short years ago. I’m interested in becoming conscious enough to use them well.</p><p>\\\nAI-aware. Embodied. Relationally grounded. And most importantly of all: Sovereign.</p><p>\\\nThe mirror is powerful.</p><p>\\\nBut at some point, you have to step away from it — and live.</p><p>\\\nYour story and your life; your growth, your direction - they are yours. They belong to you, and the people you associate with - and to the world. Let AI be a mirror to your transformation, a guide and a helper to your growth and your story -</p><p>\\\nBut make sure to retain the sovereignty and authorship of your Growth, your Identity, and your narrative - where they belong.</p><p><strong>If this resonated with you: I’m turning this into a short field guide.

In 2022, the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the company for potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act, as Cerebral came under scrutiny for its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/16/cerebral-ceo-david-mou-interview-adderall/\">prescribing of ADHD medications like Adderall</a>.</p><p>\\\nThis is just the latest in a series of federal actions cracking down on health data privacy online.

Taken together,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/04/consumer-health-information-handle-extreme-care\">FTC attorney Lesley Fair wrote in a blog post</a>&nbsp;Monday, the cases mean “businesses in the health sector should make privacy and data security part of the corporate DNA.”</p><p>\\\nBoth the FTC and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights have targeted third-party tracking, often in concert—as Fair cracked, they’re “joined at the HIPAA.” While OCR directly enforces the longstanding privacy protections in health care, the FTC has gone after companies for falsely claiming their HIPAA compliance.</p><p>\\\nIn response, some health care companies, including Monument and Cerebral, started self-disclosing health data breaches to OCR in 2023. The “unauthorized access or disclosure” of health data at Monument left more than 100,000 individuals’ information vulnerable, the company reported. Cerebral disclosed that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/22/cerebral-lawsuit-privacy/\">its breach impacted more than 3 million</a>.</p><p>\\\nAn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2022/12/13/telehealth-facebook-google-tracking-health-data/\">investigation from STAT and the Markup in 2022</a>&nbsp;found that dozens of telehealth companies, including Cerebral and Monument, were leaking sensitive health data to third parties like Google, TikTok, and Meta through the use of pixel trackers embedded in their websites. In Cerebral’s onboarding survey, which asks users to answer questions about their mental health and other symptoms, a pixel sent the answers to Meta along with information that could be used to identify the individual user.</p><p>\\\nThe FTC’s complaint alleges that between 2019 and 2023, Cerebral sent information including contact details, medical histories, insurance information, and prescriptions to third parties through tracking tools, and that the information was used to provide advertising and analytics services to the telehealth company.</p><p>\\\nCerebral referred STAT to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cerebral.com/cerebral-reaches-settlement-with-the-ftc\">statement</a>&nbsp;posted to its website, where it acknowledged its settlement with the FTC. “As part of the resolution, Cerebral has agreed to implement enhanced consumer protection, privacy, and compliance measures to further protect the personal information of our clients, increase transparency into our data practices, and implement enhanced data security protocols and tools to allow our clients control over their privacy settings,” the statement reads.</p><p>\\\nUnder the Justice Department order referred to the FTC, Cerebral must permanently stop using and disclosing users’ personal and health information to outside companies for most marketing or ad purposes, and get consumers’ consent in any instances when it does disclose. It must also post a notice on its website about the complaint and steps that it’s taking to address it.</p><p>\\\nThe complaint also says the company and former CEO Kyle Robertson broke privacy promises to customers and misled them about the cancellation process. “Robertson drove Cerebral’s decision to exploit users’ [personal and health information] without their consent in scores of targeted advertisement campaigns,” the complaint reads. The complaint alleges these actions constituted “unfair and deceptive” business practices — a key enforcement area for the FTC. Robertson has not agreed to a settlement.</p><p>\\\nThe proposed order says Cerebral will pay $5.1 million to partially refund customers who were affected by its deceptive cancellation policy, as well as $2 million of a $10 million civil penalty “due to the company’s inability to pay the full amount.”</p>","contentLength":5247,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why China’s humanoid robot industry is winning the early market","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/28/why-chinas-humanoid-robot-industry-is-winning-the-early-market/","date":1772290800,"author":"Kate Park","guid":314,"unread":true,"content":"<article>China’s push into humanoid robots is accelerating, with domestic firms shipping more units and iterating faster than U.S. competitors in a still-nascent market.</article>","contentLength":162,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Salesforce’s CodeT5 Could Change How AI Writes and Understands Code","url":"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss","date":1772290097,"author":"salesforce.com","guid":390,"unread":true,"content":"<ol><li>Yue Wang, wang.y@salesforce.com  (Salesforce Research Asia)</li><li>Weishi Wang, weishi.wang@salesforce.com  (Salesforce Research Asia; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)</li><li>Shafiq Joty, sjoty@salesforce.com  (Salesforce Research Asia; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore)</li><li>Steven C.H. Hoi, shoi@salesforce.com  (Salesforce Research Asia)</li></ol><p>Pre-trained models for Natural Languages (NL) like BERT and GPT have been recently shown to transfer well to Programming Languages (PL) and largely benefit a broad set of code-related tasks. Despite their success, most current methods either rely on an encoder-only (or decoder-only) pre-training that is suboptimal for generation (resp. understanding) tasks or process the code snippet in the same way as NL, neglecting the special characteristics of PL such as token types. We present CodeT5, a unified pre-trained encoder-decoder Transformer model that better leverages the code semantics conveyed from the developer-assigned identifiers. Our model employs a unified framework to seamlessly support both code understanding and generation tasks and allows for multi-task learning. Besides, we propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training task that enables the model to distinguish which code tokens are identifiers and to recover them when they are masked. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the user-written code comments with a bimodal dual generation task for better NL-PL alignment. Comprehensive experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms prior methods on understanding tasks such as code defect detection and clone detection, and generation tasks across various directions including PL-NL, NL-PL, and PL-PL.

It aims to derive generic representations for programming language (PL) and natural language (NL) via pre-training on unlabeled source code. As illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a>, we extend the denoising Seq2Seq objective in T5 by proposing two identifier tagging and prediction tasks to enable the model to better leverage the token type information from PL, which are the identifiers assigned by developers. To improve the NL-PL alignment, we further propose a bimodal dual learning objective for a bidirectional conversion between NL and PL.</p><p>In the following, we introduce how CodeT5 encodes PL and NL inputs (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark2\">3.1</a>) and our proposed identifier-aware pre-training tasks (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark3\">3.2</a>), followed by the fine-tuning with task-specific transfer learning and multi-task training (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark4\">3.3</a>).</p><h2>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encoding NL and PL</h2><p>At the pre-training stage, our model would receive either PL-only or NL-PL as inputs depending on whether the code snippet has accompanying NL descriptions or not. For the NL-PL bimodal in-puts, we concatenate them into a sequence with a delimiter token [SEP] and represent the whole input sequence into the format as  = ([CLS], 1*, …, wn*, [SEP], 1*, …, cm*, [SEP]), where  and  denote the number of NL word tokens and PL code tokens, respectively. The NL word sequence will be empty for PL-only unimodal inputs.</p><p>In order to capture more code-specific features, we propose to leverage token type information from code. We focus on the type of identifiers ( function names and variables) as they are one of the most PL-agnostic features and reserve rich code semantics. Specifically, we convert the PL segment into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and extract the node types for each code token. Finally, we construct a sequence of binary labels  ∈ {0*,* 1} for the PL segment, where each  ∈ {0*,* 1} represents whether the code token  is an identifier or not.</p><h2>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-training Tasks</h2><p>We now introduce our proposed pre-training tasks that enable CodeT5 to learn useful patterns from either PL-only or NL-PL bimodal data.</p><p><strong>Identifier-aware Denoising Pre-training.</strong> De-noising Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) pre-training has been shown to be quite effective in a broad set of NLP tasks (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark48\">Song et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark48\">2019</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raf-fel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>; <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>). This denoising objective typically first corrupts the source sequence with some noising functions and then requires the decoder to recover the original texts. In this work, we utilize a span masking objective similar to T5 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) that randomly masks spans with arbitrary lengths and then predicts these masked spans combined with some sentinel tokens at the decoder. We refer this task to <strong>Masked Span Prediction (MSP)</strong>, as illustrated in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> (a).</p><p>Specifically, we employ the same 15% corrup-tion rate as T5 and ensure the average span length to be 3 by uniformly sampling spans of from 1 to 5 tokens. Moreover, we employ the  by sampling spans before subword tokenization, which aims to avoid masking partial sub-tokens and is shown to be helpful (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark49\">Sun et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark49\">2019</a>). Notably, we pre-train a shared model for various PLs to learn robust cross-lingual representations. We describe the masked span prediction loss as:</p><p>where θ are the model parameters, x \\mask is the masked input, x mask is the masked sequence to predict from the decoder with k denoting the number of tokens in x mask,  and xmask &lt;t is the span sequence generated so far.</p><p>To fuse more code-specific structural information (the identifier node type in AST) into the model, we propose two additional tasks:  and <em>Masked Identifier Prediction (MIP)</em> to complement the denoising pre-training.</p><p>\\\n•&nbsp;&nbsp;  It aims to notify the model with the knowledge of whether this code token is an identifier or not, which shares a similar spirit of syntax highlighting in some developer-aided tools. As shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark1\">2</a> (b), we map the final hidden states of the PL segment at the CodeT5 encoder into a sequence of probabilities  = (1*, …, pm*), and compute a binary cross entropy loss for sequence labeling:</p><p>where  are the encoder parameters. Note that by casting the task as a sequence labeling problem, the model is expected to capture the code syntax and the data flow structures of the code.</p><p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Masked Identifier Prediction (MIP)</strong> Different from the random span masking in MSP, we mask all identifiers in the PL segment and employ a unique sentinel token for all occurrences of one specific identifier. In the field of software engineering, this is called  where changing identifier names does not impact the code semantics.

For understanding tasks, we investigate two ways of either generating the label as a unigram target sequence (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>), or predicting it from the vocabulary of class labels based on the last decoder hidden state following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>).</p><p> We also explore a multi-task learning setting by training a shared model on multiple tasks at a time. Multi-task learning is able to reduce computation cost by reusing the most of model weights for many tasks and has been shown to improve the model generalization capability in NL pre-training (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark38\">Liu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark38\">2019a</a>). We follow <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raffel et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) to employ the same unified model for all tasks without adding any task-specific networks but allow to select different best checkpoints for different tasks. To notify the model with which task it is dealing with, we design a unified format of task control codes and prepend it into the source inputs as shown in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark0\">1</a>. For instance, we employ “Translate Java to CSharp:” as the source prompt for the code-to-code translation task from Java to CSharp.</p><p>As different tasks have different dataset sizes, we follow Conneau and Lample (2019) to employ a balanced sampling strategy. For N number of datasets (or tasks), with probabilities {qi} N i=1, we define the following multinomial distribution to sample from:</p><p>where ni is number of examples for i-th task and α is set to 0.7. This balanced sampling aims to alleviate the bias towards high-resource tasks.</p><p>We follow Feng et al. (2020) to employ CodeSearchNet (Husain et al., 2019) to pre-train CodeT5, which consists of six PLs with both unimodal and bimodal data. Apart from that, we additionally collect two datasets of C/CSharp from BigQuery1 to ensure that all downstream tasks have overlapped PLs with the pre-training data. In total, we employ around 8.35 million instances for pretraining. Table 1 shows some basic statistics. To obtain the identifier labels from code, we leverage the tree-sitter2 to convert the PL into an abstract syntax tree and then extract its node type information. We filter out reserved keywords for each PL from its identifier list. We observe that PLs have different identifier rates, where Go has the least rate of 19% and Ruby has the highest rate of 32%.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Code-specific Tokenizer</h2><p>Tokenization is a key ingredient for the success of pre-trained language models like BERT and GPT. They often employ a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to-kenizer (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark47\">Sennrich et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark47\">2016</a>) to alleviate the Out-of-Vocabulary (OoV) issues. Specifically, we train a Byte-level BPE tokenizer following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">Radford et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">2019</a>) and set the vocabulary size to 32,000 as T5. We add additional special tokens ([PAD], [CLS], [SEP], [MASK0], …, [MASK99]). This tokenzier is trained on all of our pre-training data with non-printable characters and low-frequent tokens (occurring &lt;3 times) filtered. We compare it with T5’s default tokenizer and find that our tokenizer largely reduces the length of tokenized code sequence by 30% - 45% on downstream tasks. This will accelerate the training and especially benefit generation tasks due to the shorter sequence to predict. We also spot a severe problem for applying the T5’s default tokenizer on source code, where it would encode some common code tokens such as brackets [‘{’, ‘}’] into unknown tokens.</p><h2>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downstream Tasks and Metrics</h2><p>We cover most generation and understanding tasks in the CodeXGLUE benchmark (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>) and employ the provided public datasets and the same data splits following it for all these tasks.</p><p>We first consider two cross-modal generation tasks.  aims to summarize a function-level code snippet into English descriptions. The dataset consists of six PLs including Ruby, JavaScript, Go, Python, Java, and PHP from CodeSearchNet (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>). We employ the smoothed BLEU-4 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark36\">Lin and Och</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark36\">2004</a>) to eval-uate this task.  is the task to gen-erate a code snippet based on NL descriptions. We employ the Concode data (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark33\">Iyer et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark33\">2018</a>) in Java where the input contains both NL texts and class environment contexts, and the output is a function. We evaluate it with BLEU-4, exact match (EM) accuracy, and CodeBLEU (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark44\">Ren et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark44\">2020</a>) that considers syntactic and semantic matches based on the code structure in addition to the n-gram match.</p><p>Besides, we consider two code-to-code generation tasks.  aims to migrate legacy software from one PL to another, where we focus on translating functions from Java to CSharp and vice versa.  aims to convert a buggy function into a correct one. We employ two Java datasets provided by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark51\">Tufano et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark51\">2019</a>) with various function lengths: small (fewer than 50 tokens) and medium (50-100 tokens). We use BLEU-4 and exact match to evaluate them.</p><p>We also investigate how CodeT5 performs on two understanding-based tasks. The first one is  that aims to predict whether a code is vulnerable to software systems or not. We use the C dataset provided by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark54\">Zhou et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark54\">2019</a>) for experiment. The second task is  which aims to measure the similarity between two code snippets and predict whether they have the same functionality. We experiment with the Java data provided by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark53\">Wang et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark53\">2020</a>). We employ F1 score and accuracy for evaluating these two tasks respectively. In total, our CodeT5 supports six tasks and fourteen sub-tasks in CodeXGLUE with a unified encoder-decoder model.</p><p>We compare CodeT5 with state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models that can be categorized into three types: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. As  models, we consider RoBERTa (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark39\">Liu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark39\">2019b</a>), RoBERTa (code) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) on code, CodeBERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">Feng et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark30\">2020</a>) trained with both MLM and replaced token detection (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark23\">Clark et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark23\">2020</a>), GraphCode-BERT (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark31\">Guo et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark31\">2021</a>) using data flow from code, and DOBF (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark46\">Rozière et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark46\">2021</a>) trained with the identifier deobfuscation objective. Note that although DOBF employs a Seq2Seq model during pre-training, it only aims to train a better encoder for downstream tasks without exploring the poten-tial benefit of the pre-trained decoder.</p><p>For  models, we compare GPT-2 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">Radford et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark42\">2019</a>) and its adaptations on code domain including CodeGPT-2, and CodeGPT-adapted. The difference is that the latter one utilizes a GPT-2 checkpoint for model initialization while the former one is trained from scratch. As  models, the current SOTA model for the CodeXGLUE benchmark is PLBART (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark21\">Ah-mad et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark21\">2021</a>) based on BART (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>) architecture. For pre-training data, most of these models employ CodeSearchNet (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>) except DOBF and PLBART. DOBF is pre-trained on 7.9M Java and 3.6M Python files from BigQuery while PLBART employs a much larger data with 470M Python and 210M Java functions, and 47M NL posts from StackOverflow.</p><h2>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model Configurations</h2><p>We build CodeT5 based on Huggingface’s T5 (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">Raf-fel et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark43\">2020</a>) PyTorch implementation<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark13\">3</a> and employ two sizes of CodeT5-small (60M) and CodeT5-base (220M). We set the maximum source and target sequence lengths to be 512 and 256, respectively. We use the mixed precision of FP16 to accelerate the pre-training. We set the batch size to 1024 and employ the peak learning rate of 2e-4 with linear decay. We pre-train the model with the denoising objective for 100 epochs and bimodal dual training for further 50 epochs on a cluster of 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40G memory. The total training time for CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base is 5 and 12 days, respectively.</p><p>In the fine-tuning phase, we find that the tasks in CodeXGLUE (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>) are quite sensitive to some hyper parameters such as learning rate, training steps, and batch size. We conduct a grid search and select the best parameters based on the validation set. In multi-task learning, we cover all downstream tasks except clone detection.</p><h2>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results and Analysis</h2><p>In this section, we compare CodeT5 with SOTA models on a broad set of CodeXGLUE downstream tasks (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark12\">5.1</a>), and investigate the effects of our bimodal dual generation and multi-task learning (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark17\">5.2</a>), followed by a detailed analysis on the proposed identifier-aware pre-training (§<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark20\">5.3</a>).</p><h2>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CodeXGLUE Downstream Tasks</h2><p>We evaluate two sizes of our model: CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base that are pre-trained with identifier-aware denoising. In addition, we consider the model that continues to train with bimodal dual generation (dual-gen) and show the results with multi-task fine-tuning. The results of all comparison models are obtained from their original papers and also the CodeXGLUE paper (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">Lu et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark40\">2021</a>).</p><p> We show code summarization results of smoothed BLEU-4 on six PL data in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark8\">2</a>. We observe all our model variants significantly outperform prior work with either an encode-only (RoBERTa, CodeBERT, DOBF) or encoder-decoder framework (PLBART). Moreover, the salient performance gap between these two groups of models confirms that encode-only frameworks are suboptimal for generation tasks. Compared to the SOTA encoder-decoder model PLBART, we find that even our CodeT5-small yields better overall scores (also on Python and Java) given that our model is much smaller (60M vs. 140M) and PLBART is pre-trained with much larger Python and Java data (&gt; 100 times). We attribute such improvement to our identifier-aware denoising pre-training and better employment of bi-modal training data<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark14\">4</a>. By increasing the model size, our CodeT5-base boosts the overall performance by over 1.2 absolute points over PLBART.</p><p> We compare CodeT5 with GPT-style models and PLBART in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark9\">3</a>. Our CodeT5-small outperforms all decoder-only mod-els and also the SOTA PLBART, which again confirms the superiority of encoder-decoder models at generating code snippets. Moreover, our CodeT5-base further significantly pushes the SOTA results across three metrics. Particularly, it achieves around 4.7 points improvement on CodeBLEU over PLBART, indicating our CodeT5 can better comprehend the code syntax and semantics with the fier-aware pre-training.</p><p>\\\n<strong>Code-to-Code Generation Tasks.</strong> We compare two code-to-code generation tasks: code translation and code refinement in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark10\">4</a> and further consider one naive copy baseline by copying the source input as the target prediction. In the code translation task, our CodeT5-small outperforms most of base-lines and obtains comparable results with PLBART, which shows the advantages of encoder-decoder models in the code-to-code generation setting. Our CodeT5-base further achieves consistent improvements over PLBART across various metrics for translating from Java to C# and vice versa.</p><p>Here we show one CodeT5’s output of translating C# to Java in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark15\">3</a>. In this case, despite the poor BLEU score, CodeT5 is able to generate a function that reserves the same functionality and even has better readability compared to the ground-truth. This reveals that CodeT5 has a good generalization ability instead of memorizing and repeating what it has seen before. On the other hand, it also suggests that BLEU score is not a perfect evaluation metric for code generation tasks, where sometimes a higher score can instead reflect the problematic copy issues of neural models.</p><p>Another code-to-code generation task is code refinement, a challenging task that requires detecting which parts of code are buggy and fix them via generating a bug-free code sequence. Due to the large overlap of source and target code, even the naive copy approach yields very high BLEU scores but zero exact matches. Therefore, we focus on the exact match (EM) metric to evaluate on this task. As shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark10\">4</a>, we observe that EM scores for the small data are consistently higher than the medium one, indicating that it is harder to fix bugs for a longer code snippet. Our CodeT5-base significantly outperforms all baselines on EM and especially boosts over 4.8 points for the more challenging medium task (13.96 vs. GraphCodeBERT’s 9.10), reflecting its strong code understanding capability.</p><p> We compare with two understanding tasks of defect detection and clone detection in Table 5.</p><p>Specifically, we generate the binary labels as a unigram sequence from the decoder for the defect detection task, while for the clone detection task, we first obtain the sequence embedding of each code snippet using the last decoder state following <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">Lewis et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark35\">2020</a>) and then predict the labels by measuring their similarity. Both CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base outperform all baselines on the defect detection task while CodeT5-base yields 2.6 accuracy score improvement than PLBART. For the clone detection task, our CodeT5 models achieve comparable results to the SOTA GraphCodeBERT and PLBART models. These results demonstrate that with an encode-decoder framework, our CodeT5 can still be adapted well for understanding tasks.</p><h2>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effects of Bimodal Dual Generation and Multi-task Learning</h2><p>We examine the effects of bimodal dual generation at pre-training and multi-task learning at fine-tuning. The bimodal pre-training brings consistent improvements for code summarization and generation tasks on both CodeT5-small and CodeT5-base. However, this pre-training task does not help and even sometimes slightly hurts the performance for PL-PL generation and understanding tasks. We anticipate this is because bimodal dual generation learns a better alignment between PL and NL that naturally benefits the former tasks involving both PL and NL. As a side effect, this objective could bias the model towards the PL-NL tasks and affect its performance on PL-PL tasks.</p><p>In multi-task learning, it generally improves most of downstream tasks except the code translation and defect detection. Particularly, it largely boosts the performance on code summarization, which is not surprising as code summarization takes up the largest portion of sub tasks (six out of thirteen) and thereby benefit the most from the multi-task learning. Besides, we observe that multi-task learning consistently improves the performance of code refinement, which might benefit from the joint training of both small and medium refinement data.</p><p>\\\nAnother possible reason is that multi-task training with defect detection would enable the model to better comprehend the code semantics for bug detection, which is also a necessary intermediate step for code refinement.</p><h2>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing Identifier-aware Pre-training</h2><p>We provide an ablation study to examine the contribution of each component in our identifier-aware objective. Specifically, we compare the performance of our CodeT5-small on four selected tasks by ablating each of the three objectives: masked span prediction (MSP), identifier tagging (IT), and masked identifier prediction (MIP). As shown in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark16\">6</a>, we observe that generally removing one of the objectives would reduce the performance for all tasks, indicating that all objectives contribute to the better code understanding of our CodeT5. However, the effect of each objective differs across tasks. Specifically, removing MSP would largely reduce the performance of all generation tasks but instead increase the defect detection performance. This shows that masked span prediction is more crucial for capturing syntactic information for generation tasks. On the contrary, removing MIP would hurt the defect detection task the most, indicating that it might focus more on code semantic understanding. By combining these objectives, our CodeT5 can better capture both syntactic and semantic information from code.</p><p>We further provide outputs from CodeT5 and its variant without MIP and IT on code generation in Figure <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark18\">4</a>. We observe that CodeT5 can correctly generate the exact function, while the model without MIP and IT fails to recover the identifiers of “s2” and “hasField”. This shows our identifier-aware denoising pre-training can better distinguish and leverage the identifier information.</p><p>We also investigate the identifier tagging performance and find it achieves over 99% F1 for all PLs, showing that our CodeT5 can confidently distinguish identifiers in code. We then check whether MSP and MIP tasks would have conflicts as they employ the same sentinel tokens for masking. In identifier masking, all occurrences of one unique identifier are replaced with the same sentinel token, resulting in a many-to-one mapping compared to the one-to-one mapping in span prediction. We compare models pre-trained with either MSP or MIP, and both on these two tasks in Table <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark19\">7</a>. We report the prediction accuracy and also the ratio of how often they can generate the same number of predictions as the sentinel tokens. We observe that pre-training only with either MIP or MSP would bias the model towards that task, achieving poor accuracy and higher mismatch in number of predictions when applied to the other task. Interestingly, we find that MIP-only objective can better recover the correct number of predictions in the MSP task than MSP-only does for the MIP task, meaning that it is easier to adapt from many-to-one mapping to one-to-one mapping and difficult for the opposite. At last, combining them can help our model to make a good trade-off on both tasks.</p><p>We have presented CodeT5, a pre-trained encoder-decoder model that incorporates the token type information from code. We propose a novel identifier-aware pre-training objective to better leverage the identifiers and propose a bimodal dual generation task to learn a better NL-PL alignment using code and its comments. Our unified model can support both code understanding and generation tasks and allow for multi-task learning. Experiments show that CodeT5 significantly outperforms all prior work in most CodeXGLUE tasks. Further analysis also reveals its better code comprehension capability across various programming languages.</p><h2>Broader Impact and Ethical Consideration</h2><p>Our work generally belongs to NLP applications for software intelligence. With the goal of improving the development productivity of software with machine learning methods, software intelligence research has attracted increasing attention in both academia and industries over the last decade. Software code intelligence techniques can help developers to reduce tedious repetitive workloads, enhance the programming quality and improve the overall software development productivity. This would considerably decrease their working time and also could potentially reduce the computation and operational cost, as a bug might degrade the system performance or even crash the entire system. Our work addresses the fundamental challenge of software code pre-training, our study covers a wide range of code intelligence applications in the software development lifecycle, and the proposed CodeT5 method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on many of the benchmark tasks, showing its great potential benefit towards this goal.</p><p>We further discuss the ethical consideration of training CodeT5 and the potential risks when applying it into real-world downstream applications:</p><p> The training datasets in our study are source code including user-written comments from open source Github repositories and publicly available, which do not tie to any specific application. However, it is possible that these datasets would encode some stereotypes like race and gender from the text comments or even from the source code such as variables, function and class names. As such, social biases would be intrinsically embedded into the models trained on them. As suggested by <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">Chen et al.</a> (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">2021</a>), interventions such as filtration or modulation of generated outputs may help to mitigate these biases in code corpus.</p><p> Our model pre-training requires non-trivial computational resources though we have tried our best to carefully design our experiments and improve experiments to save unnecessary computation costs. In fact, compared to the recent large-scale language model Codex (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">Chen</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark22\">2021</a>), our CodeT5-base has a much smaller model size of 220M than theirs of 12B (∼ 55×). In addition, we experiment on Google Cloud Plat-form which purchases carbon credits to reduce its carbon footprint,  training CodeT5-base produced around 49.25 kg CO2 which was totally off-set by the provider. Furthermore, we release our pre-trained models publicly to avoid repeated training for the code intelligence research community.</p><p> As CodeT5 can be deployed to provide coding assistance such as code generation for aiding developers, automation bias of machine learning systems should be carefully considered, especially for developers who tend to over-rely on the model-generated outputs. Sometimes these systems might produce functions that superficially appear correct but do not actually align with the developer’s intents. If developers unintentionally adopt these incorrect code suggestions, it might cause them much longer time on debugging and even lead to some significant safety issues. We suggest practitioners using CodeT5 should always bear in mind that its generation outputs should be only taken as references which require domain experts for further correctness and security checking.</p><p> We train CodeT5 on existing code corpus including CodeSearchNet (<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">Husain et al.</a>, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/salesforces-codet5-could-change-how-ai-writes-and-understands-code?source=rss#_bookmark32\">2019</a>) and a small fraction of Google BigQuery, both of which are originally collected from public Github repositories. Pre-trained mod-els might encode some sensitive information ( personal addresses or identification numbers) from the training data. Though we have conducted multi-rounds of data cleaning to mitigate this before training our models, it is still possible that some sensitive information cannot be completely removed. Besides, due to the non-deterministic nature of generation models like CodeT5, it might produce some vulnerable code to harmfully affect the software and even be able to benefit more advanced malware development when deliberately misused.</p><p>We thank Akhilesh Deepak Gotmare, Amrita Saha, Junnan Li, and Chen Xing for valuable discussions.
