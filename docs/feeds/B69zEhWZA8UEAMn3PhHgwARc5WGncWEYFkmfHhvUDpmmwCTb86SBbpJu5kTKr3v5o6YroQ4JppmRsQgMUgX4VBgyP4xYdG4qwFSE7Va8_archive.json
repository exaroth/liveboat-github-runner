Jimmy Carter, the earnest Georgia peanut farmer who as U.S. president struggled with a bad economy and the Iran hostage crisis but brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday. He was 100.\n\n2. South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok ordered an emergency safety inspection on Monday of the country's entire airline operation system as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused the deadliest air disaster in the country.\n\n3. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday the 2023 debt ceiling extension agreed by then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden will \"go down as one of the dumbest political decisions made in years.\"\n\n4. Finnish police said on Sunday they had found tracks that drag on for dozens of kilometres along the bottom of the Baltic Sea where a tanker carrying Russian oil is suspected of breaking a power line and four telecoms cables with its anchor.\n\n5. Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks broadcast on Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. \n\n#News #jimmycarter #joebiden #donaldtrump #us #southkorea #jejuair #planecrash #usdebtceiling #finland #underseacable #balticsea #syria #ahmedalsharaa #middleeast #russia #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nðŸ‘‰  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/bcaWsJFBPVY?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"LIVE: View of Jeju Air crash site at South Korea's Muan airport","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz0wfl_x_Hg","date":1735564837,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"content":"A view of the crash site at South Korea's Muan International Airport after a Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 belly-landed and skidded off the end of the runway, erupting in a fireball as it slammed into a wall.
