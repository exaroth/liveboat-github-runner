Since taking charge of X -- formerly known as Twitter -- Elon Musk has used the social media platform as a platform for his own political views. And, after spending millions of dollars helping to secure Donald Trump’s return to the White House, he's now wading into European politics -- expressing support for far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe, including here in Germany. In December, he tweeted his support for the far-right, Alternative for Germany party -- or AfD. With a general election in February, the AfD is polling second - and parts of the party are being monitored by German domestic security services as \"possible threats to democracy\". \n\nHe's also attacked Germany's leaders, saying that Chancellor Olaf Scholz, \"should resign immediately,\" and calling him an \"incompetent fool\". And of German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, he said, \"Steinmeier is an anti-democratic tyrant! Shame on him\".  Berlin has accused Elon Musk of election interference. \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#musk #afd #democracy","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/-GUvVxsY5mU?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Why Volkswagen's unique history could cause its downfall | Business Beyond","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpEw0QRilGs","date":1736200839,"author":"DW News","unread":true,"content":"Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest car maker, is in crisis.
