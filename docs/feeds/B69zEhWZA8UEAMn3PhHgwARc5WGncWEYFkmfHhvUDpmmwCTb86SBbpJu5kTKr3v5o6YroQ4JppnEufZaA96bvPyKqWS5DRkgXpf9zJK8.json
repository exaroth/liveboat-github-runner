Early on Monday morning, several buses carrying the detainees left the gates of Israel's Ofer prison, just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the release. The freed prisoners are said to be women and teenage boys from the West Bank and Jerusalem. They are the first of 1900 Palestinians Israel is set to release in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages in phase one of the deal.\nEarlier, the first Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas militants as part of the deal.  Three women held captive for 471 days were finally brought back home to Israel - alive.  For other families, the wait continues. The six-week pause in fighting, which began on Sunday, will also allow hundreds of truckloads of aid per day to be brought in to the devastated territory.
