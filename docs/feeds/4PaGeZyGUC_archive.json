But why? Is it due to nutrition? The good weather? Or genetics? Scientists around the world are attempting to solve the mystery.\n\n91-year-old Antonangelo leads a busy life. Every morning, he goes to milk his flock of sheep and later, turns that milk into cheese. \"Work is my life, if I stop, I'll die,‚Äù says Antonangelo. Like many Sardinians in the mountain regions, he and his wife eat almost exclusively local produce. Their recipes for a long life are exercise and healthy food.\n\nGiuseppino is already 100 years old and still manages most of the steep paths in his home village of Villagrande on foot. Is the strenuous hillside location the secret of his longevity? Giuseppino's family takes care of him, but he still lives alone in his flat and is bursting with energy. For him, a positive attitude and a sense of humor are key to a long life.\n\nDespite a good deal of research, the secrets of the Blue Zones still haven‚Äôt been fully explained. But one study from the region does concludes that genetics play an important role in the first half of life. For 91-year-old Carolina, it‚Äôs clear that an intact family is a prerequisite for a long life. She has no intention of going into an old people's home. For her, the most important thing is for a mother to grow old with her children. And traditional food preparation is still one of her favorite pastimes.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #eternallife #italy #sardinia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The film accompanies these men of faith and combat, from their recruitment in Switzerland to their military training in the heart of the Vatican.\n\nMade up of 150 men, this elite corps lives in barracks in the heart of Vatican City. All must be Swiss nationals and devout Catholics. All have sworn to fight to the death to protect their faith and the Holy Father.\n\nThey are heirs to a 500-year-old tradition in which the Pope‚Äôs protection and security were assured by mercenaries from Switzerland.\n\nTrained to wield both halberds and semi-automatic assault rifles, the Swiss Guards form a unique army.

Here‚Äôs why.\n\nEvery spring, millions of people are left coughing, sneezing, and itching their way out of winter. It‚Äôs a sign that nature is blooming back to life, dumping a ton of pollen into the air ‚Äî and, subsequently, our respiratory tracts. Seasonal allergies are undeniably miserable, so it‚Äôs unsurprising that people are looking for miracle cures. One popular idea is to try and microdose pollen with honey.\n\nThe theory goes like this: Pollen causes seasonal allergies. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowering plants to produce honey. So‚Ä¶a small amount of pollen is found in honey, therefore if you eat local honey you can introduce small amounts of pollen to your immune system and help your body gradually build an immunity to it. Boom. Seasonal allergies cured. The only problem? It doesn‚Äôt actually work, but honey does have a ton of other benefits. Watch the video above to learn more.\n\nSupport our work.

Concerns about misinformation, bias, data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and accessibility issues, to name just a few of the concerns, seem to appear everywhere in the media. Who is the latest organization to be breached? Which airport is recovering from an \"incident\" - that wonderfully vague word?\n\nDelivering technology in a responsible manner includes considering all the stakeholders to the solution, not just the obvious ones. The various flavors of architects operating across a solution (perhaps just a small number of people wearing different hats) must attempt to bring the perspectives of other stakeholders into the discussion surrounding features, targets, security requirements, and more. Making this work can be a challenge for teams.\n\nIn this talk, I will first discuss some principles of responsible technology and describe the various ways that making tech responsible generates value for organizations. I will then discuss how various aspects of responsible tech intersect with our good friends the -ilities. Finally, I will describe some techniques that can be used to support teams on their way to building responsible technology.

From minimal type annotations to knowing when to use advanced features, Stefan shares insights on efficient project setup, alternatives to enums, and the strategic use of classes.\n\nThe conversation examines the philosophy behind TypeScript's design while emphasizing a pragmatic approach that focuses on understanding what happens behind the scenes to make better coding decisions. Stefan consistently advocates for simplicity and intentionality when working with TypeScript's powerful but sometimes complex type system.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:30 Intro to the TypeScript Cookbook\n13:42 Project setup: Keeping it simple\n20:14 Use type annotations strategically\n25:44 Avoiding enums in favor of simpler alternatives\n36:12 Classes: When to use them &amp; when to avoid them\n42:44 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nStefan Baumgartner ‚Ä¢ TypeScript Cookbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4iefuM7\nStefan Baumgartner ‚Ä¢ TypeScript in 50 Lessons ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4lEBanw\nAlexandre Portela dos Santos ‚Ä¢ Deno Web Development ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3MZBY7g\nFernando Doglio ‚Ä¢ Introducing Deno ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3KOFBKy\nDan Vanderkam ‚Ä¢ Effective TypeScript ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DBmCib\nNathan Rozentals ‚Ä¢ Mastering TypeScript ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2V4LYUt\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#TypeScript #JavaScript #Deno #Deno2 #Denoland #TypeScriptCookbook #enum #Frontend #WebDevelopment #TodayInTech #SoftwareDesign #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #StefanBaumgartner #PeterKroener #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

They made this commitment more than 20 years ago. But even today, more than a million minors are still working on cocoa plantations. How is this possible?\n\nIn 2002, the chocolate industry made a contractual commitment to ban child labor on cocoa plantations within five years. We want to know: are companies honoring this commitment? Many chocolate manufacturers stand for fair trade and sustainability -- and against child labor. But as the film shows, often the fancy labels on chocolate packaging are just empty promises.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, for example, children still toil on cocoa plantations - with the simplest of tools, and without protective clothing, although they handle pesticides - for many hours every day. Often, they‚Äôre not the farmers‚Äô children, but ‚Äòslave children‚Äô sent as laborers by desperate families in Mali or Burkina Faso because they‚Äôre no longer able to feed them.\n\nBut there are some small rays of hope: In the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic promotes fair organic farming. There is barely any child labor in this island nation and cocoa farmers can expect a fair income. Although the Caribbean produces just two per cent of global cocoa, it‚Äôs an example of what can be done.\n\nThe film also shows that sometimes, companies are unaware of conditions on the plantations, as practices are concealed by the middlemen. And that in some countries, little has changed since the signing of the protocol to end child labor in the cocoa industry.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cocoa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war. \n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity.

Where the clouds almost always blow past before they turn to rain. A city with the Guinness World Record for consecutive sunny days, where the local newspaper was willing to bet against the weather by giving a free paper out whenever the sun didn‚Äôt shine. And spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt give out that many.\n\nThat city is St. Petersburg, Florida ‚Äî and for the most part, it actually lives up to its reputation. In the average year it gets 361 days of sunshine, which sounds impossible in the wet and rainy state of Florida. But St. Pete exists in what we call a meteorological goldilocks zone. So what exactly is it that makes this Florida city so damn sunny?

Residents of these underserved neighborhoods are forced to live with violence and a lack of opportunities. But not everyone is willing to accept the situation.\n\nIn the areas known as the \"Quartiers Nord\" or \"Northern Quarters\" of Marseille, drug trafficking and gang wars are a part of everyday life. Drug-related violence has claimed dozens of lives in recent years and the French government has been unable to improve the situation, leaving residents in a hopeless situation. But Amine Kessaci wants to change that. The 21-year-old is the founder of an organization called Conscience. The group campaigns locally and citywide for better living conditions in these neighborhoods. It also supports families who have lost loved-ones to drug-related gang violence ‚Äî something Amine has experienced himself.\nAnother ray of hope for these troubled districts is a converted firefighting bus that provides medical assistance. Doctor Slim Hadiji and his team offer preventive care and hold information events. They also make house calls and accompany patients to medical appointments. The initiative supports those who would otherwise receive little to no help.\nMeanwhile, local football club FCL Malpass√© is an important community hub and a safe haven for the children and young people living in these areas. The club's coaches are available around the clock. They hope their club can offer young people not just a safe place to go, but also a chance to improve their lives.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #marseille #france  \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

At the center is a transplant clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, where patients from Germany and Israel in particular meet donors from countries in the Caucasus such as Azerbaijan. There are also young Kenyans who are persuaded that they are getting a good deal at 4,000 euros for a kidney. Recipients pay up to ‚Ç¨200,000 ($222,000 USD) to organ traffickers.

Vivien worked as an escort and dominatrix for four years. Christina was forced into sex work by her drug-addicted mother.\n\nThe change in the law regarding sex work presupposes that people offer sexual services voluntarily and that they are of legal age. However, the reality is often different.\n\nVivien and Christina talk about their lives as sex workers and how they got out. Vivien is now a social worker, supporting young girls. She was raised in a single-parent household and money was extremely tight. She also longed for male recognition. She was often sexually exploited and was even raped once. She ceased sex work in 2022 and is now involved with Sisters e. V., an organization that supports sex workers. \n\nA shelter for women was Christina's salvation. She was forced to offer her body in brothels, brothels, and, often, on the streets. In the process, she experienced a lot of violence. Christina was able to escape in a cloak-and-dagger operation. But she had trouble adjusting, and her inner demons rose up inside her. She went back into the milieu - into a life she knew. After a year, she left for a second time - this time successfully. Today she lives with her young daughter in a shelter.\n\nSince the new sex work law passed, there have been fewer investigations into human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. But many women are afraid to testify, says Helmut Sporer, a former senior criminal investigator in the field of sex work and human trafficking.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It‚Äôs not magic‚Äîit‚Äôs deep mastery of user experience.\n\nIn this talk, I‚Äôll reveal how the same principles that game developers use to guide players through complex game worlds can be applied to other fields. In this talk, Theo will use game design examples from her work on games for NASA and Space X's Polaris Dawn and Artemis missions to illustrate how game developers weave these experiences with concrete techniques and principles. By applying these techniques, other tech fields can elevate their user interactions to be just as intuitive, engaging, and effective.\n\nGet ready for a journey from gamepads to launchpads that might just change how you see UX and your relationship with your users.

Many legends surround the most famous buccaneers. But who were these men? Simple sailors or brutal thieves? How did they live? This film journeys back in time for answers.\n\nThe period between 1690 and 1730 is considered the golden age of piracy. Pirates continue to occupy a special place in the legends of sea adventure: As romantic figures and heroes of stories, pirates still enjoy a positive image today. \n\nBut does this image -- shaped by Hollywood and fiction -- correspond to reality? So far, only a few wrecks of pirate ships have been located and little is known about the everyday lives of the crews. On Mauritius, and in the bay of the Sainte Marie Island off Madagascar, two research missions are seeking concrete answers to these questions. \n\nArchaeologists are exploring the remains of the \"Speaker‚Äù, the ship that belonged to the famous pirate John Bowen, who died 1704. The scientists are also researching traces of his crew's stays ashore. Until now, the history of piracy was thought to be largely localized in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean; only a few historians suspected the existence of pirates off the coasts of Madagascar. \n\nOver the course of his research in the National Library of France, archaeologist Jean Soulat from the LandArc laboratory in Paris discovered documents that led his ideas in new directions -- and turned his previous ideas about piracy on their heads. He decided to put together an international research team of archaeologists and historians to conduct further study. For the first time, numerous aspects of pirates‚Äò daily lives - on land, and on the water -- are being recreated.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #pirates \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Do they have feelings? Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gary O‚ÄôReilly, and Harrison Greenbaum explore the intelligence of plants with astrobotanist Simon Gilroy. From venus flytraps to space farming, we dig deep into the secret world of plants.\n\nWe start by looking at plant awareness‚Äîdo plants know they‚Äôre being eaten? Can they predict where the sun is going to be in the morning? How do plants communicate internally without a central nervous system or a brain? Simon explains how plants communicate through chemistry, using glutamate signals, and how psychoactive molecules help defend the plant from predators. \n\nWe explore one of nature‚Äôs weirdest plants: the Venus flytrap. Can it count? How does it actually move? And can plants form memories? We explore how plants ‚Äúlearn‚Äù from past experiences as well as the dark side to the smell of freshly mowed grass. If a plant survives a harsh winter, how does it know when it‚Äôs safe to grow again? Plus, we ask: do plants know when they're in space? \n\nHow do plants react in microgravity? Can they tell which way is up without gravity to guide them? What happens when you try to grow plants in lunar soil‚Äîcan they survive without the nutrients they depend on here on Earth? And if Martian soil is toxic, could astronauts really fertilize their crops using composted waste? How close are we to turning science fiction into reality?\nFinally, could we engineer tastier space food? Would tomatoes grown in orbit taste the same as those on Earth? What about spicy peppers‚Äîdoes space change their flavor? We discuss what foods should be targeted for space farming and what farming on another planet would look like. What if the light around another star is in a different spectrum?

Programming languages are the medium through which developers codify systems and fragments.\nIn each programming language is embedded a philosophy (or many) of how to think about code, how to organise thoughts, how to design. Programming languages also define skillsets, ecosystems, jobs, loyalties and communities.\n\nWhen we think of software and technology we often think in terms of progress and rapid change. Programming languages, however, typically move at a far slower pace. Mainstream languages are still embracing ideas that are decades old. Constructs that developers welcome as new to their language of choice are often older than the developers themselves. And over all this hangs the question, what of the future?\nHow will current trends, from FOSS to LLMs, shape programming languages and their use?\n\nIn this talk, we will take a tour of the past, present and future of programming languages.

Key concepts such as deliberate practice, retrieval practice, and the value of psychological safety in team dynamics are explored, offering insights into effective learning and collaboration. The relationship between working memory and long-term memory is examined, highlighting how techniques like the Pomodoro Technique and spaced repetition optimize retention. Additionally, the conversation underscores the potential of AI in education, encouraging its integration despite concerns among educators.\n\nLastly, the phenomenon of rustiness in skill retention is explained through the dynamics of neural connections, with a hopeful outlook on the future of neuroscience research in understanding conditions like autism and dyslexia.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarbara Oakley ‚Ä¢ A Mind For Numbers\n (https://amzn.to/3Z2tjqi) Pooja K.

Hackers exploit human error or technical loopholes to steal data -- or publish it on the darknet, if the ransom demanded is not paid. It‚Äôs a practice wiith catastrophic consequences.\n\nIt can happen to anyone: Private individuals, companies, administrations, schools and even hospitals are falling victim to attacks by hackers. The media has been reporting on cybercrime for years and the trend is rising. Hackers are more powerful than ever - and always ready to exploit human error or technical vulnerabilities to penetrate the IT systems of companies, administrations or private individuals. Their tools include ransomware, i.e. malware that installs itself on a computer to lock it or encrypt data on it. Once this has been done, the criminals can steal the data. They then threaten to publish it on the darknet if the ransom demanded - in cryptocurrency, of course - is not paid. In the USA alone, the damage caused by cyberattacks in 2023 amounted to 12.5 billion dollars. An amount that, within two years, had more than doubled.\n\nA report published by the European Union for Network and Information Security in late 2022 highlights the particular risks faced by the healthcare sector. In fact, thousands of hospitals worldwide have already been virtually attacked. One hospital in Israel, for example, made a virtue of necessity, filming and publishing its handling of the attack to prevent other hospitals from falling into the same trap.\n\nIn the film, victims and their relatives talk about how their lives have been impacted by cyberattacks. Company bankruptcies, loss of pension insurance, even suicide - the consequences can be fatal. In the film, viewers also hear from a hacker, who explains how straightforward it is to deprive people of their data.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #hacker #cybersecurity \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality‚Äîa method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting \"residues\" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.\n\nUnlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.\n\nO'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n00:56 Genesis of the residuality book\n09:00 The role of uncertainty in software architecture\n16:56 Explaining residuality\n22:20 Fun with random stressors\n29:39 From playfulness to robust design\n35:13 The Architect's Paradox explained\n40:28 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ Residues ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/residuality\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ The Architect‚Äôs Paradox ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox\nJacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patterns ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3E37lvv\nAnne Currie &amp; Jamie Dobson ‚Ä¢ The Cloud Native Attitude ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3R0exeT\nGregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ The Software Architect Elevator ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3F6d2ax\nGregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ Enterprise Integration Patterns, Vol 2 ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3TNedQ3\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareArchitecture #Residues #Residuality #ComplexityScience #RobustDesign #uncertainty #RandomStrossors #Playfulness #TechCommunication #SoftwareDesign #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #BarryOReilly #JacquiRead #tekiegirl #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Harrison Greenbaum explore black hole collisions, quantum tricks, and how gravitational waves can help us uncover the early universe with MIT physicist and LIGO researcher Nergis Mavalvala.\n\nWhat are gravitational waves, and how do they stretch and squeeze spacetime? We break down Hawking radiation and why gravity itself doesn‚Äôt get sucked into a black hole. How did Einstein predict them, and why did it take a century to confirm their existence? Nergis breaks down how LIGO can measure distortions smaller than a proton. How do scientists bypass and manipulate quantum uncertainty to measure gravitational waves? \n\nWe go over Einstein‚Äôs general relativity and what cosmic phenomena it predicted. We dive into the violent collisions of black holes‚Äîwhat happens when objects moving at half the speed of light crash together? Learn how LIGO works and how lasers help us to make these minuscule measurements. Could gravitational waves let us see into the universe‚Äôs earliest moments before the cosmic microwave background? \n\nFinally, how does every great scientific discovery build on those that came before? What technological advancements might come from gravitational wave research?

Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice sit down with planetary scientist Rick Binzel, the creator of the Torino Scale, to discuss asteroid hazards, the results of the asteroid sample return, and the search for Planet 9.\n\nRick, a former MIT professor and OSIRIS-REx investigator, has been obsessed with asteroids since he published his first paper at age 15. He and Neil go way back‚Äîboth attended the same nocturnal astronomy camp, where they spent their nights scanning the cosmos. Learn how Rick helped measure Pluto‚Äôs moon transiting in front of the dwarf planet‚Äîrevealing Pluto‚Äôs real size for the first time.\n\nWe break down the Torino Scale, a 10-point system that categorizes asteroid impact risk. What does it mean when an asteroid has a 1.3% chance of hitting Earth? How do astronomers refine those probabilities over time? We discuss YR-4, an asteroid with a fluctuating impact risk, and the cosmic game of uncertainty. Why do asteroid impact predictions sometimes look like a spaghetti string of possibilities?\n\nThen, we turn to Apophis, the ‚ÄúGod of Chaos‚Äù asteroid that will pass closer than some satellites in 2029. With OSIRIS-APEX set to visit it post-flyby, what can we learn about its composition? Plus, we get the latest on the OSIRIS-REx mission‚Äîwhat did its asteroid sample reveal about the origins of life?\n\nAnd finally, is there a hidden ninth planet lurking beyond Pluto? Some scientists see hints in the Kuiper Belt, while Chuck Nice has his own theory: a giant alien mothership. Neil and Rick debate what it would take to confirm (or debunk) Planet 9‚Äôs existence.

What now?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsIhfMKg4-Q","date":1743422417,"author":"Vox","guid":43,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The new US secretary of Health and Human Services has a long history of spreading misinformation about vaccines.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. has been called the most unqualified health secretary in the history of the US. Before his confirmation, over 22,000 doctors signed a letter urging the Senate to reject his appointment. During the confirmation hearing several senators grilled him on his concerning history related to vaccine misinformation: things like his founding of an anti-vax organization, his concerning anti-vax rhetoric, and his history of suing vaccine manufacturers, something he stands to make a lot of money doing. \n\nThe former environmental lawyer was propelled to the nation‚Äôs highest health office largely by the ‚ÄúMAHA‚Äù movement, a play on Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù slogan (‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äù). As health secretary, Kennedy wants to solve the chronic disease epidemic in the US, which plenty of doctors can get behind. The issue is that he aims to do it at the expense of infectious disease research. And therein lies the problem. Most people can agree when he says things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supportive of vaccines‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want good science.‚Äù The trouble is that his definition of ‚Äúgood‚Äù is, well ‚Äî let‚Äôs call it historically shaky. In March, he appointed a well-known vaccine skeptic to head a study on the long-debunked potential link between vaccines and autism.\n\nSo what‚Äôs next? Can RFK Jr. take away vaccines that are already on the market? It‚Äôs unlikely, but he doesn‚Äôt need to. Kennedy sits at the helm of the very department he‚Äôs been undermining for years. In that position, the power he has over vaccine policy isn‚Äôt limitless, but the changes he can make could ripple for decades. \n\nSupport our work.

The U.S. government would charge two Americans with a slew of felonies, including soliciting the murder of government officials on Telegram.

Behind the workhouse building lies a cemetery where they were buried - now it is being carefully excavated as the whole site is being redeveloped.  It‚Äôs a rare opportunity to investigate the treatment of London‚Äôs destitute in the late 18th and 19th centuries - a story that was repeated in great cities across the world as people poured into them in search of work.\n\nTony has a special connection with this story - not only has been making archaeology films for decades, he also appeared as a child actor in the first stage production of the musical, ‚ÄúOliver!‚Äù.  He knows digging and he knows Dickens! He explores the finds from the excavations, from humble clay pipes to dissected skeletons revealing how dead inmates could be anatomised in the name of medical science.\n\nThis film combines unique archaeology, as well as social and literary history - the care of the poor, how their plight was brought to the attention of the public and the extreme challenges created by burgeoning cities. Dickens was writing about his times, but like all good history, the heart of it remains relevant today. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.
