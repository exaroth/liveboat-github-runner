Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.\n\nBack in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.\nThey also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. \nA nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.\nFor four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.\n\nIf you are suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.\n\nIn this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?\n\nIn short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Building Resilient Distributed Systems ‚Ä¢ https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-resilient-distributed/9781098163532\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Monolith to Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Nml96E\nSam Newman ‚Ä¢ Building Microservices ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3dMPbOs\nRonnie Mitra &amp; Irakli Nadareishvili ‚Ä¢ Microservices: Up and Running‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3c4HmmL\nMitra, Nadareishvili, McLarty &amp; Amundsen ‚Ä¢ Microservice Architecture ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3fVNAb0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Microservices #JamesLewis #Thoughtworks #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.\n\nThis is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. \n\nBecause shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #shame #emotionaljourney \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She was his most important support as he embarked on a difficult journey: Lend had decided to live not as a woman, but as a trans man.

Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?\n\nIn April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in ≈Ωilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.\n\nWhile millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler‚Äôs account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?\n\nBombing Auschwitz | Secrets of the Dead\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? \nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. \n\nIn this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.\n\n*Note* On Occasion this video shows archive footage of captured German submarines flying Allied flags/ensigns\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video: \nhttps://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_W90k5g28 \n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nx.com/I_W_M\ninstagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nfacebook.com/iwm.london\n\nAttributions:\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1980-128-63 / CC-BY-SA 3.0\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1976-127-06A / CC-BY-SA 3.0\nBundesarchiv, Bild 101II-MW-3491-06 / Buchheim, Lothar-G√ºnther / CC-BY-SA 3.0\nVector Map of the World: https://freevectormaps.com/world-maps/WRLD-EPS-01-0001?ref=atr\nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d0cc437e92884a98966ab6b235143573\nhttps://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/bell-atlantic-battle/\nhttps://uboat.net/allies/merchants/losses_year.html\nhttps://uboat.net/fates/losses/chart.htm\nhttps://mapsterman.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/fe88b5e18c6443c7afaf6e32f8432687</article>","contentLength":1749,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/sxguMx5Ph5w?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Seychelles uncovered: The heroin crisis in paradise | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouSSXpNftmQ","date":1738170062,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":10,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Beneath the beauty, the Seychelles harbor a shocking secret: It‚Äôs estimated around 10% of the adult population is addicted to heroin.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the quantum origins of the universe, charge parity violation, dark matter, and the many quarks that make up our world with CERN particle physicist Harry Cliff. \n\nWe take a look at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and his work in studying b quarks (or ‚Äúbeauty quarks‚Äù) and sifting through mountains of data to identify new phenomena. We break down the 17 known fundamental particles‚Äîincluding six quarks, three electron-like particles, and three neutrinos. What particles are yet to be uncovered? Could that be the answer to dark matter?\n\nAs we dive into the early universe, we explore how matter and antimatter formed in nearly equal amounts, only for matter to triumph in a cosmic imbalance. What conditions created this asymmetry? We discuss CP violation and the other laws of nature that the universe may have broken to create itself. \n\nHarry also dives into the lifespan of particles, from the fleeting existence of most, to the surprising stability of protons and electrons. Learn how particle discoveries evolved, from Henri Becquerel‚Äôs observation of radioactivity to Karl Anderson‚Äôs discovery of antimatter in cosmic rays. We also explore how Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity applies to particle accelerators, where particles moving near light speed experience time differently. Could these machines create a micro black hole? Harry explains why media fears of ‚Äúdestroying the universe‚Äù are unfounded and why the cosmos has been conducting such experiments for billions of years.\n\nFinally, we tackle questions about dark matter, its presence in everyday life, and the hypothetical tachyons that could travel faster than light. Through it all, Harry sheds light on the quantum fields underpinning reality, revealing how particles are ripples in these invisible forces. With insights from his books, How to Make an Apple Pie from Scratch and Space Oddities, Harry guides us through the thrilling world of particle physics, showing how much we‚Äôve learned‚Äîand how much more there is to discover. \n\nPublications by Harry Cliff:\nSpace Oddities: The Mysterious Anomalies Challenging Our Understanding of the Universe - https://amzn.to/3WEEd41\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Harry Cliff\n05:53 - The 17 Fundamental Particles\n08:25 - Is Dark Matter a Particle? \n11:40 - Finding the First Particles\n17:09 - Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry\n21:46 - What Started the Big Bang? \n25:00 - Quantum Field Theory v.

Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan‚Äôs national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.\n\nIn response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîthat Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. \n\nIn War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy‚Äôs primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.\n\nUnder Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy‚Äôs long-range scouting capabilities. As \"scout cruisers of the air,\" airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy‚Äôs first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.\n\nIn 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>","contentLength":3348,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/w6vgVTJK_rg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From India to Germany - Creating a new world with good food | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4z76ynr98","date":1737910842,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":8,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Running a restaurant as an Indian woman?

The current solutions to problems such as navigation, traffic/terrain collision avoidance and weight/balance calculations will be demonstrated to the audience, mostly for amusement. More seriously, we will have a look at the legacy that has led to the way things are, and how to improve by applying our programming skills.\n\nWe will look at:\n‚Ä¢ how aviation safety is regulated.\n‚Ä¢ how aeronautical services are provided to flight operators.\n‚Ä¢ how aeronautical navigation is conducted and regulated.\n‚Ä¢ how the weight and balance for a flight is conducted.\n‚Ä¢ the methods by which aircraft and ground coordinate between each other.\n\nWe will see:\n‚Ä¢ some real (and basic) data management problems in aviation, that very obviously threaten safety, then solve them, using programming.\n‚Ä¢ we will see a live demonstration of aeronautical navigation methods, investigate incident reports where lives were lost as a result, and consider how our programming skills can yield improvements, possibly even save lives.\n‚Ä¢ we will conduct a real weight&amp;balance calculation for a flight, then once hilarity inevitably ensues, we will look at the problems that arise by this method, then solve them using data structures and functional programming. Some of these practical problems are obvious, even to a non-aviator, and the predictable incident reports are the end result.\n‚Ä¢ finally, we will have a look at a live demonstration of a software defined radio (SDR), receiving ADS-B transmissions from aircraft (live), an #AHRS implementation and #GNSS receiver using off-the-shelf, low-cost parts. We will look at why these instruments are helpful to aircraft pilots and interact with that device using the #Haskell programming language.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Matthew ‚Ä¢ Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DVZEaw\nAmir Husain ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4ak3BBJ\nMatt Pearson ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/40cm0vS\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#FunctionalProgramming #Aviation #TonyMorris #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.\n\nIs consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it‚Äôs so hard to pin down what makes you ‚Äúyou.‚Äù From Descartes‚Äô ‚Äúbeast machines‚Äù to Darwin‚Äôs revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. \n\nWill AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness‚Äîor even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids‚Äîtiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us‚Äîand why it matters.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Anil Seth\n3:25 - Does Consciousness Even Exist? \n4:55 - Is AI Conscious? \n7:37 - Answering the Consciousness Problem\n15:05 - Why Are You You? \n18:48 - Is Pansychism Real? \n23:58 - Consciousness in the Animal Kingdom\n30:15 - Intelligence v.

This is because Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine has highlighted Europe's and especially Germany's dependence on Russian gas. One possible solution is to increase gas imports from Africa, which already account for around a fifth of the gas used in Europe.\n\nMozambique in southern Africa is expected to become the third largest African exporter of liquefied natural gas. Senegal in West Africa is also seen as a major future gas supplier. \n\nWhat does this development mean for the people of Mozambique and Senegal? Will they actually benefit from gas exports as hoped? Can the utilization of gas reserves create new jobs and help to reduce migration from Senegal to Europe? \n\nSo far, the gas sector in Mozambique has led to conflict rather than prosperity.

She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family‚Äôs fate played no role in her life.\n\nBut when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. \n\nEva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. \n\nHer mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva‚Äôs young life.\n\nDuring her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.\n\nBut a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. \n\nLater in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #holocaustsurvivor \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Elaine is from Brazil, Yassin is from Tunisia. Camera teams accompany the two for nine months in their new working environments.\n\nGermany‚Äôs labor market desperately needs skilled workers - particularly in the medical sector. There‚Äôs also a high demand for professional drivers. That‚Äôs why many companies are recruiting internationally.\n\nElaine from Brazil worked as head of nursing at the emergency department and intensive care unit of a clinic in S√£o Paulo. She‚Äôs married and has an eight-year-old son. She‚Äôs long dreamed of living in Europe; S√£o Paulo‚Äôs high crime rate is one of the reasons why she‚Äôs keen to leave her homeland. \"I can‚Äôt travel alone to early or late shifts. I‚Äôll either be raped or robbed,\" she says. In Germany, she‚Äôs hoping for security and a better quality of life - something she‚Äôd like for her son in particular. Elaine initially goes to D√ºsseldorf alone; the family plans to join her later. But it won‚Äôt be easy for the Brazilian woman. Despite the language barrier, bureaucracy, and the loneliness that comes with being separated from her loved ones, can Elaine start to feel at home in Germany?\nYassin originates from Sousse, a Tunisian coastal city. After leaving fininshing his schooling, he worked there as a truck driver. In Tunisia, the only requirements for this job are a driving license and initial training. Things are different in Germany: Yassin is training as a professional driver for three-and-a-half years at a haulage company in Hesse. Tunisian driver‚Äôs licenses aren‚Äôt recognized in European countries, so he needs to pass the tests again. Yassin‚Äôs trainers describe him as ‚Äòhighly motivated and very good‚Äô. His final exam is coming up soon. Will the young man, who‚Äôs also learning German, make it as a skilled worker on the German labor market? If so, he‚Äôd like a small flat where he can invite friends round. His current room, which doesn‚Äôt have a kitchen, isn‚Äôt suitable - and hospitality is very important in his home country.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.\n\nTogether, they envision a world where better tools and AI lower the barrier to entry for developers, driving innovation and enabling more people to bring their ideas to life.

As Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. \n\nThe US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. \n\nFluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains ‚Äî and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.  \n\nSources and further reading:\n\nThe new meta-analysis along with an editorial by Bruce Lanphear and Steven Levy can be found here: \nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control has more information on the history of community water fluoridation: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/timeline-for-community-water-fluoridation/index.html#:~:text=1956,over%20the%20next%20few%20decades\n\nUndark science magazine covered the communities in the US that have groundwater levels of fluoride that are higher than the World Health Organization maximum: \nhttps://undark.org/2024/05/06/tap-water-high-dose-of-fluoride/\n\nUndark‚Äôs podcast team made an episode where they interviewed two scientists on either side of the fluoride safety debate: \nhttps://undark.org/2024/12/23/podcast-fluoride-toxic-low-levels/\n\nHere is the Calgary study we mention: \nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542152/\n\nHere is the National Toxicology Program‚Äôs monograph that preceded the meta-analysis: \nhttps://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/ntp/ohat/oeccaaho/mgraph/occchemo_final20190300_508.pdf\n\nA similar study to the Calgary one found that water fluoride was beneficial in Juneau, Alaska\nhttps://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2019/02/happened-juneau-took-fluoride-drinking-water.cshtml</article>","contentLength":2664,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2XkV-AMhBvo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"3 Extraordinary Leaders Who Defined The Ancient World","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6zNE7o0onQ","date":1736460028,"author":"Timeline - World History Documentaries","guid":392,"unread":true,"content":"<article>These documentaries are People Profiles Productions on the lives of legendary leaders Augustas, Ramesses II and King Leonidas.
