Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan‚Äôs national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.\n\nIn response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced‚Äîrightfully so‚Äîthat Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. \n\nIn War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy‚Äôs primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.\n\nUnder Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy‚Äôs long-range scouting capabilities. As \"scout cruisers of the air,\" airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy‚Äôs first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.\n\nIn 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>","contentLength":3348,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/w6vgVTJK_rg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From India to Germany - Creating a new world with good food | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4z76ynr98","date":1737910842,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":15,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Running a restaurant as an Indian woman?

The current solutions to problems such as navigation, traffic/terrain collision avoidance and weight/balance calculations will be demonstrated to the audience, mostly for amusement. More seriously, we will have a look at the legacy that has led to the way things are, and how to improve by applying our programming skills.\n\nWe will look at:\n‚Ä¢ how aviation safety is regulated.\n‚Ä¢ how aeronautical services are provided to flight operators.\n‚Ä¢ how aeronautical navigation is conducted and regulated.\n‚Ä¢ how the weight and balance for a flight is conducted.\n‚Ä¢ the methods by which aircraft and ground coordinate between each other.\n\nWe will see:\n‚Ä¢ some real (and basic) data management problems in aviation, that very obviously threaten safety, then solve them, using programming.\n‚Ä¢ we will see a live demonstration of aeronautical navigation methods, investigate incident reports where lives were lost as a result, and consider how our programming skills can yield improvements, possibly even save lives.\n‚Ä¢ we will conduct a real weight&amp;balance calculation for a flight, then once hilarity inevitably ensues, we will look at the problems that arise by this method, then solve them using data structures and functional programming. Some of these practical problems are obvious, even to a non-aviator, and the predictable incident reports are the end result.\n‚Ä¢ finally, we will have a look at a live demonstration of a software defined radio (SDR), receiving ADS-B transmissions from aircraft (live), an #AHRS implementation and #GNSS receiver using off-the-shelf, low-cost parts. We will look at why these instruments are helpful to aircraft pilots and interact with that device using the #Haskell programming language.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Matthew ‚Ä¢ Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DVZEaw\nAmir Husain ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4ak3BBJ\nMatt Pearson ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/40cm0vS\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#FunctionalProgramming #Aviation #TonyMorris #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.\n\nIs consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it‚Äôs so hard to pin down what makes you ‚Äúyou.‚Äù From Descartes‚Äô ‚Äúbeast machines‚Äù to Darwin‚Äôs revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. \n\nWill AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness‚Äîor even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids‚Äîtiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us‚Äîand why it matters.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Anil Seth\n3:25 - Does Consciousness Even Exist? \n4:55 - Is AI Conscious? \n7:37 - Answering the Consciousness Problem\n15:05 - Why Are You You? \n18:48 - Is Pansychism Real? \n23:58 - Consciousness in the Animal Kingdom\n30:15 - Intelligence v.

This is because Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine has highlighted Europe's and especially Germany's dependence on Russian gas. One possible solution is to increase gas imports from Africa, which already account for around a fifth of the gas used in Europe.\n\nMozambique in southern Africa is expected to become the third largest African exporter of liquefied natural gas. Senegal in West Africa is also seen as a major future gas supplier. \n\nWhat does this development mean for the people of Mozambique and Senegal? Will they actually benefit from gas exports as hoped? Can the utilization of gas reserves create new jobs and help to reduce migration from Senegal to Europe? \n\nSo far, the gas sector in Mozambique has led to conflict rather than prosperity.

She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family‚Äôs fate played no role in her life.\n\nBut when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. \n\nEva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. \n\nHer mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva‚Äôs young life.\n\nDuring her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.\n\nBut a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. \n\nLater in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #holocaustsurvivor \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He advocates for a top-down vision that encourages non-technical roles, such as finance and operations, to engage deeply with technical teams, fostering a service mindset rather than a sole focus on product features.\n\nTod highlights the importance of operational insights in multi-tenant environments, where effective monitoring of tenant behaviors is essential to prevent issues before they impact customers. He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.\n\nLooking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nTod Golding ‚Ä¢ Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures\n (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) Adam Tornhill ‚Ä¢ Software Design X-Rays\n (https://amzn.to/3DEeEnI) Adam Tornhill ‚Ä¢ Your Code as a Crime Scene\n (https://amzn.to/3FI5E2V) Matthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais ‚Ä¢ Team Topologies\n (http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ) Monica Beckwith ‚Ä¢ JVM Performance Engineering\n (https://amzn.to/3BkRoiO) Dave Thomas &amp; Andy Hunt ‚Ä¢ The Pragmatic Programmer\n (https://amzn.to/3azvUy3) Diana Montalion ‚Ä¢ Learning Systems Thinking (https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Elaine is from Brazil, Yassin is from Tunisia. Camera teams accompany the two for nine months in their new working environments.\n\nGermany‚Äôs labor market desperately needs skilled workers - particularly in the medical sector. There‚Äôs also a high demand for professional drivers. That‚Äôs why many companies are recruiting internationally.\n\nElaine from Brazil worked as head of nursing at the emergency department and intensive care unit of a clinic in S√£o Paulo. She‚Äôs married and has an eight-year-old son. She‚Äôs long dreamed of living in Europe; S√£o Paulo‚Äôs high crime rate is one of the reasons why she‚Äôs keen to leave her homeland. \"I can‚Äôt travel alone to early or late shifts. I‚Äôll either be raped or robbed,\" she says. In Germany, she‚Äôs hoping for security and a better quality of life - something she‚Äôd like for her son in particular. Elaine initially goes to D√ºsseldorf alone; the family plans to join her later. But it won‚Äôt be easy for the Brazilian woman. Despite the language barrier, bureaucracy, and the loneliness that comes with being separated from her loved ones, can Elaine start to feel at home in Germany?\nYassin originates from Sousse, a Tunisian coastal city. After leaving fininshing his schooling, he worked there as a truck driver. In Tunisia, the only requirements for this job are a driving license and initial training. Things are different in Germany: Yassin is training as a professional driver for three-and-a-half years at a haulage company in Hesse. Tunisian driver‚Äôs licenses aren‚Äôt recognized in European countries, so he needs to pass the tests again. Yassin‚Äôs trainers describe him as ‚Äòhighly motivated and very good‚Äô. His final exam is coming up soon. Will the young man, who‚Äôs also learning German, make it as a skilled worker on the German labor market?

Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.\n\nTogether, they envision a world where better tools and AI lower the barrier to entry for developers, driving innovation and enabling more people to bring their ideas to life.

And the trend is rising. The German harvest can‚Äòt meet this demand and that‚Äôs why many berries are imported. From places where their cultivation is bad news for both people and for nature itself.\n\nSouthern Portugal is a booming region for berry production in Europe. The country‚Äôs cultivation zone has increased fivefold in recent years - to almost 5,000 hectares. One of the producers: Logofruits. The Portuguese company grows blueberries on its plantation in Odemira on 75 hectares of land. For the owner, Louren√ßo de Botton, the biggest challenge is finding enough workers for the harvest season. Blueberries have to be picked by hand, a labor-intensive process that requires Logofruits to employ around 600 workers per day. Many of those toiling in the orchards in the Alentejo region come from Nepal, India or Bangladesh.\n\nOdemira‚Äôs mayor H√©lder Guerreiro explains that almost 11,000 migrant workers from over 80 countries now live here. This corresponds to around 40 per cent of the municipality's population. Although on the one hand it‚Äôs a great opportunity for the region, which has struggled with emigration in the past, it also presents a huge social challenge. Another problem, according to Guerreiro, is intensive farming‚Äôs huge demand for water.\n\nOne thing‚Äôs for sure: a growing appetite for berries in Germany has consequences for the countries where they are grown. Blueberries and raspberries also grow in Germany, but not all year round. In summer, supermarkets should be full of regional fruit. But they‚Äôre not. Even during the domestic season, more and more produce from abroad can be found on the fresh produce shelves. What does this mean for German berry producers?\n\nErik Appel from Darmstadt grows raspberries, among other things. However, berries cultivated in Germany are completely different to those that have been shipped over long distances. These varieties have been bred to be particularly robust and long-lasting. When it comes to raspberries from the region for the local market, flavor is paramount. And in that respect, says Erik Appel, nothing beats local berries. In terms of labor costs however, it‚Äôs almost impossible to compete with imported goods. After all, Germany has one of the highest minimum wages in Europe. This is reflected in the price - imported goods are often cheaper than regional berries.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, creative coding has a high barrier to entry due to the breadth of knowledge and coding skills required. This talk aims to lower that barrier for you to take home and practice creative coding.\n\nIn this talk, you will learn about #algorithms and techniques for generative art using a pure #FunctionalParadigm. First, shepherding random numbers to simulate the universality of nature patterns that appear in plants, rocks, sand, and smoke. Next, using L-system formal grammar to create a seemingly infinite, but well-structured, series of graphics. Lastly, interfacing with printers to bring your drawing to life.\n\nFor you to get the most out of this talk, you should be comfortable working in a functional language of your choice. Although I will introduce some theory, background in mathematics and formal theory is not required to attend.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Matthew ‚Ä¢ Generative Art with JavaScript and SVG ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3DVZEaw\nAmir Husain ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4ak3BBJ\nMatt Pearson ‚Ä¢ Generative Art ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/40cm0vS\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#FunctionalProgramming #FunctionalGenerativeArt #XavierHo #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

The ultra-right has managed to gain a foothold at the very heart of US politics. As part of a strategy to win the 2024 election, it was ready to create a social divide similar to that of the secessionist wars, plunge the country into chaos and cause democracy to totter.\nThe triumph of the radical right is the outcome of a well-thought-out strategy set in motion more than 40 years ago by a conservative minority thirsty for power. And this group has pushed through its agenda under the nose of the world. Today, we can see how successful its strategy was: The ultra-right has gained control of the key centers of power, a process accelerated on all levels by Donald Trump. With his help, the ultra-right now has control of the Supreme Court. Its advance continues unabated, with Trump‚Äôs election victory marking an interim high point. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #usa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We will work through the concepts involved with implementing your own shell, and live code our way to a basic functional shell implemented in Haskell.\n\nFrom this talk, attendees will walk a way with a better understanding of a program they use every day, as well as ideas and inspiration around using functional programming to solve mundane programming problems.\n\nDownload slides here:\nhttps://mth.io/talks/mundane-utility\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSourav Ghosh ‚Ä¢ Building Low Latency Applications with C++ ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3szwUhV\nSteve Scargall ‚Ä¢ Programming Persistent Memory ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3Pk79ex\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#MundaneUtility #FucntionalShell #ReliableSystems #Failure #Change #MarkHibberd #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

This film shows how this commitment became a pillar of society. What measures are needed today to defend humanist values and preserve democratic achievements?\n\nThe film provides an insight into the challenges and hopes of remembrance culture work and examines how the motto ‚Äònever again‚Äô is evolving into an educational policy obligation in Germany.\n\nWith the end of the Second World War, two words became an integral part of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany: ‚ÄòNever again‚Äô. Never again fascism, never again war, never again a dictatorship like National Socialism, in which minorities are persecuted, disenfranchised and murdered. This endeavor gave rise to a culture of remembrance, which manifested itself in the form of education in schools, memorials and days of remembrance.\n\nBut sometimes, it seems like the more frequently these words appear in official speeches, the more they lose their clarity and meaning. The discourse on a meaningful culture of remembrance is mainly conducted in academia, and often doesn‚Äôt consider the realities of life in society at large.\n \nThe documentary is an incisive and confrontational look at practical remembrance work. It shows what measures need to be taken to protect democracy and human rights in Germany. It focuses on the everyday lives of those who put the culture of remembrance into practice, and those who benefit from it.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But this film documents a bleak scenario -- in which microcredits have destroyed entire families. Over-indebtedness has driven some recipients to suicide.\n\nExpectations were high. When Muhammad Yunus, the \"banker to the poor‚Äù and founder of the Grameen Bank for microfinance in Bangladesh, received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2006, it was clear to many that the principle of helping people to help themselves would lift many out of poverty. \n\nFrom the 1980s to the early 2000s, microcredits were seen as one of the best tools for combating poverty. However, the loans, which were initially seen as a positive inflow of liquidity, quickly led to further financial obligations for many families. After all, interest had to be paid on these loans. Illegal lenders stepped in. The pressure on families became unbearable, leading to the sale of land, migration, the break-up of families and ultimately even suicide.\n\nThe film tells the stories of three Cambodian families. Along the way, it debunks the myth of microfinance as a tool that truly helps the poor. Told through the eyes of the protagonists and through their personal experiences, this film highlights the hardships faced by so many Cambodians because of debt. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #cambodia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place ‚Äì soldiers sharing their diaries.\n\nOur speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!\n\nThis lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more videos about arms and armour  \n\nHelp us bring history to life by supporting us here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\n\nSign up to our museum membership scheme here: https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/ \n\n‚öîWebsite: https://royalarmouries.org/home\n‚öîBlog: https://royalarmouries.org/stories/\n‚öîFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RoyalArmouriesMuseum/\n‚öîTwitter: https://twitter.com/Royal_Armouries\n‚öî Instagram: http://instagram.com/royalarmouriesmuseum\n\nWe are the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national collection of arms and armour.

Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with actor Laurence Fishburne to explore the science of The Matrix, simulation theory, and who has the better deep voice. Would you take the red pill? \n\nWould you rather have truth or normalcy? We explore the choice Morpheus presents Neo and how it pertains to science. Laurence shares the experience of bringing Morpheus to life. He and Neil unpack the film‚Äôs profound symbolism as well as discuss the blending of ancient mythology with the emerging digital age.\n\nWe analyze the plausibility of the movie‚Äôs central premise. Can humans really serve as batteries for machines? We explore simulation theory, pondering whether our universe could be one of many nested simulations, as posed by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom. From the optical science behind the iconic spoon-bending scene to the film‚Äôs intricate religion and philosophy, we explore the storytelling elements that make The Matrix timeless.\n\nNeil connects its themes to questions about reality, truth, and human potential. Plus, a few surprises‚Äîincluding the ‚Äúdeep voice-off‚Äù and musings on why gods always have baritone voices‚Äîmake this episode a must-listen for movie buffs and science enthusiasts alike.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Laurence Fishburne\n1:45 - Laurence‚Äôs Scientific Filmography\n10:00 - The Deepest Voice\n14:21 - THE MATRIX (Spoiler Alert)\n19:00 - Religion &amp; Mythology in The Matrix\n32:05 - The Spoon &amp; Optics\n33:29 - Smart People in Movies\n35:50 - Would You Take the Red Pill?\n37:00 - Using Humans As Batteries\n41:55 - Simulation Theory\n46:40 - Living in the Matrix\n49:20 - Talking Shakespeare\n55:12 - How Neil and Laurence Met\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Both as a productivity tool, to get work done faster and better, and also as way of building new types of products and features that were previously impossible. In fact, GenAI has completely changed the way I work and the way I look at software development. It feels like I've gained superpowers, but I've had to unlearn and change habits that I've built up over 30 years.\n\nCoding with AI is a very different way of working. And like any other skill, you kind of suck at it at first but improve with practice. The transition to this strange new world can be jarring, but it is unavoidable. Being a developer in 2024 and not coding with AI is the equivalent of being 2022 and manually writing machine code or manually creating punched cards.\n\nIn this talk I'll share practical experiences from AI-powered software development - tips, tricks, and pitfalls - using mostly live demos. These techniques will reduce your time from Idea to Working Code, which is a nice feeling üôÇ [...]\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:40 2 Metaphors for generative AI\n02:16 Gen AI is more powerful than you think\n03:40 Mindset\n04:50 It's the wild west right now\n06:16 Demo 1: Rapid prototyping\n14:47 AI in your IDE\n16:35 Demo 2: Working with APIs\n32:41 Demo: Working with legacy code\n40:45 The joy of coding\n41:42 Quality\n43:16 Recalibrate\n44:17 Probable future\n45:22 Key takeaways\n46:15 Outro\n\nDownload slides and read the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2024/sessions/3226\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAlex Castrounis ‚Ä¢ AI for People and Business ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3NYKKTo\nPhil Winder ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement Learning ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nHolden Karau, Trevor Grant, Boris Lublinsky, Richard Liu &amp; Ilan Filonenko ‚Ä¢ Kubeflow for Machine Learning ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3JVngcx\nKelleher &amp; Tierney ‚Ä¢ Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn ‚Ä¢ Machine Learning Design Patterns ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2ZD7t0x\nLakshmanan, G√∂rner &amp; Gillard ‚Ä¢ Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#AI #ArtificialIntelligence #AIAssistant #ML #LLM #DeveloperProductivity #LegacyCode #API #APIs #HenrikKniberg\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Could this altered state offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?\n\nSome are more hypnotizable than others‚Äîwhy? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic‚Äîtargeted and potent, especially for managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well as for good? \n\nFrom recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis reveals its potential‚Äîand limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize medicine. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: David Spiegel\n03:15 - What is Hypnosis? \n06:55 - Is Everyone Hypnotizable? \n12:33 - The Default Mode Network\n14:20 - Hypnosis for Memory Recovery\n21:22 - Self Hypnosis v.

As Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. \n\nThe US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. \n\nFluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains ‚Äî and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.  \n\nSources and further reading:\n\nThe new meta-analysis along with an editorial by Bruce Lanphear and Steven Levy can be found here: \nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2828425\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control has more information on the history of community water fluoridation: \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/timeline-for-community-water-fluoridation/index.html#:~:text=1956,over%20the%20next%20few%20decades\n\nUndark science magazine covered the communities in the US that have groundwater levels of fluoride that are higher than the World Health Organization maximum: \nhttps://undark.org/2024/05/06/tap-water-high-dose-of-fluoride/\n\nUndark‚Äôs podcast team made an episode where they interviewed two scientists on either side of the fluoride safety debate: \nhttps://undark.org/2024/12/23/podcast-fluoride-toxic-low-levels/\n\nHere is the Calgary study we mention: \nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9542152/\n\nHere is the National Toxicology Program‚Äôs monograph that preceded the meta-analysis: \nhttps://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/ntp/ohat/oeccaaho/mgraph/occchemo_final20190300_508.pdf\n\nA similar study to the Calgary one found that water fluoride was beneficial in Juneau, Alaska\nhttps://www.uaa.alaska.edu/news/archive/2019/02/happened-juneau-took-fluoride-drinking-water.cshtml</article>","contentLength":2664,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2XkV-AMhBvo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How Trump Learned to Love Crypto","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wonot1cgmGA","date":1736499667,"author":"Bloomberg Originals","guid":17,"unread":true,"content":"<article>On his second day back in office, President Donald Trump issued a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of dark-web marketplace Silk Road.

In Northern cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, they found strength and security in a range of Muslim organizations, from the India-based Ahmadiyya movement to the homegrown Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam. In this film, host Malika Bilal (Senior Presenter, Al Jazeera English) tells the story of these early Black American Muslim communities through a woman named Florence Watts, who moved to the bustling South Side of Chicago around 1910, where she found work as a cook and a maid. \n\nDrawing on the work of Sylvia Chan-Malik, (author of Being Muslim: A Cultural History of Women of Color in American Islam,) Malika discovers how Florence was drawn to the teachings of the Ahmadiyya missionary, Mufti Mohammad Sadiq. In 1923, she joined one of the first multi-racial Muslim communities in the country. That same year, Florence was featured in the Ahmadiyya magazine Moslem Sunrise, her image captured in one of the earliest known photographs of a group of Muslim women taken in the United States. Through Florence‚Äôs story, Malika discovers how these Muslim groups helped working-class Black Americans resist the confines of race in the United States and feel part of a global community of believers. They in turn helped to create a legacy of Islam that has been embraced by African Americans since.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley‚Äôs returning to front line service in the conflict.\n\nSecond is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.\n\nThird up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.\n\nLast but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren‚Äôs box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

His name was Werner von Braun.\n\n*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film ‚ÄúThe woman in the moon‚Äù (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film - used for illustrative purposes in the video - was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it‚Äôs technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work. \n\nLearn more about Lewis' work at lewisbush.com\nYou can order his book on Werner von Braun, Depravity's Rainbow, here: shop.lewisbush.com\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video: https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_GAE5zrAe\n\n\"Werner von Braun\" Written and performed by Tom Lehrer - Public Domain\n\nAttributions:\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1978-Anh.024-03 / CC-BY-SA 3.0\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nx.com/I_W_M\ninstagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nfacebook.com/iwm.london</article>","contentLength":1440,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/zu1G_0BBAlg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lightning: Nature‚Äôs Plasma Highway #shorts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCAm38dSD78","date":1735830056,"author":"Kurzgesagt ‚Äì In a Nutshell","guid":104,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Lightning is like a super hero movie.
