Female calves later become dairy cows themselves, while male calves are surplus to the dairy industry’s requirements. They’re packed into trucks and suffer in transit on their way to fattening facilities.\n\nCows must calve once a year to produce milk. However, male calves are unwanted, considered waste products of the dairy industry. They’re often sent to fattening farms, mostly outside the EU. A farmer, a scientist and a butcher want to change this. Instead of sending the animals to factory farms where they’re fattened with soy or corn, the bull calves are sent to the pastures and alpine meadows of the Alps.\n \nAlong with a small group of farmers, restaurateurs and retailers, dairy farmer Marcel Renz is trying to change the dairy system in southern Germany. He wants to improve animal welfare, shorten transport distances and produce good quality meat that customers are willing to pay a little more for.\n\nFor people who buy their meat from butcher Hannes Hönegger, this is a positive. The butcher works with small, traditional organic farms that rely on what’s known as dual-purpose breeds, animals not bred solely for performance. Here, cows and calves are suitable for both milk and meat production, just as they were in the past. They feed almost exclusively on what grows in the pastures. In this way, they also contribute to the protection of nature in the Alps - from the Allgäu to South Tyrol.\n \nThomas Zanon's bull calves are among the lucky ones. No long journeys, no fattening with soya or maize. Instead, they graze on his mountain pasture - a small herd that he’s rescued from the dairy industry. Thomas Zanon's main job is as an assistant professor of livestock farming at the University of Bolzano in Italy. Taking all factors into account, he says, milk is by no means inferior to milk substitutes made from oats or soya. The rescued bull calves on his alpine pasture are not only happy animals: They also embody a new approach to sustainable milk production.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, &amp; Gary O’Reilly dive into the mechanics of thinking, how AI got its start, and what deep learning really means with cognitive and computer scientist, Nobel Laureate, and one of the architects of AI, Geoffrey Hinton. \n\nHinton explains the fundamental shift from logic-based rule programming to the biological approach: building systems that learn the way a brain does. Learn about the history of computer science that led to the breakthroughs we have today. We break down the structure of artificial neural networks and the meaning of AI buzzwords like “deep learning” really mean. You’ll learn about the layering of data processing and how the first layer of neurons might detect a simple edge, the second a beak, and the third a bird’s head. \n\nHinton explains the light bulb moment of backpropagation, the mathematical breakthrough using calculus to send force backward to strengthen previous connections. Is this a process we share with neural nets? We discuss whether AI thinks like us and explore why AlphaGo succeeded in beating us at our own game by generating its own data and whether LLMs will hit a ceiling as they run out of human-written text. Can AI reason? What does it mean for something or someone to think?\n\nAs the science turns toward the future, we tackle heavy questions regarding the massive energy demands of data centers and whether AI can reinvent solar technology to save itself. Hinton discusses the \"Volkswagen Effect,\" where a model might strategically underperform to avoid being unplugged. We dive into consciousness to ask if subjective experience is just a byproduct of complex perception and if chatbots already possess it. What are the upsides as well as the downsides? The singularity isn’t imminent yet... but the \"yet\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Kylie Jonasson, Bryan Pfeifer, Anton Couzens, Brad Smith, Jeffdrumseitz, Richard Vaughan, sSHEScience©, Ben Mondoux, Julien Ballez, Tom, Matteo Berlanda, Dr. Cool Young Booger Results Murray, Shawndra Hill, Mike Easter, Charles Shields, Xander-Tony Kehr, Chase Busha, Leah, Justin Harris, Stephen Schultz, Jason West, ImaPerson, Argie Weatherington, Ted Barnett, MD, Lizzie O'Grady, Kimja, Paul Baltatescu, Hanna Cantley, Bill Hoffman, FreddieAbdon, Trish, Muath, Timeless Angel, Dxly, Michael Fuery, Tom Hadrava, Guy Eran, Max Murphy, Cristy Nourash, Donita Buchheit, Kel, Screaming Firehawk, Patricia Churchland, Mikael Stenberg, Dale Duncan, Ghostpacho, Nathan Lehenbauer, James Schaedler, Andrew G, Samuel Sladkovský, Punished Leno, Chris L, George Papura, Miguel Basto, Brittney Starkey, David Rouisse, WTFbro Podcast, Marvin, Jason Driscoll, Yasyoc, Donte Jones, Trevor, Andrew, Jared Harrison, Terence Garrod, TheCrassDragon, Daithon Brown, Perkins, Brendan Gost, Daria Shkrabachenko, Tania Cortes Alonso, JD, Jacob Westman, Lacey Rae Castleberry, Isaac Castrillo, Eric Bouliane, Tim The Secular Humanist, João Sampaio, Aegor, Evan Schreier, Amanda Burris, Allen Arthur, Vikas Jain, Jeroen Wilms, Nathan Schepker, Sverre Moe, Ruth Crisp, Legend Omega, B Dubbz, Jay Youmans, Nite Stalker, Adrian Hungate, Marguerite Nesfield, Michael Engelman, Scott Donner, Diamir Elliott, Warsame Giuled, Kansas Dan, Rey Pierantoni, and Rick Servello for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Geoffrey Hinton\n03:00 - Approaches to Make and Intelligent System\n07:19 - How Artificial Neural Nets Work\n14:12 - Making a Neural Net By Hand\n24:41 - Backpropigation Breakthrough\n33:44 - Why AI Seemed to Arrive So Fast\n34:39 - What is Thinking?\n37:50 - Is AI Better at Learning? \n47:41 - Can We Humanize AI?\n50:58 - Setting Up Guardrails\n54:04 - Is AI Lying to Us? \n58:47 - Will AI Be the End of Us All?\n01:00:51 - Does AI Hallucinate? \n01:04:36 - The Upside\n01:08:13 - Will AI Create More AI? \n01:10:17 - AI Nuclear Winter: Will We Unite?\n01:15:10 - 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics\n01:16:44 - The Price of Replacing All the Jobs\n01:22:50 - Achieving Consciousness\n01:28:37 - The Work to Be Done Before the Singularity\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\n#StarTalk #NeildeGrasseTyson</article>","contentLength":4808,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/l6ZcFa8pybE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Africa - Hotspot of the Cold War | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoGhXmDVv0Y","date":1772298038,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":15,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In the collective memory, the Cold War is the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. However, one thing is often forgotten: the two superpowers also set their sights on the African continent.\n\nTo this day, the Cold War is remembered as an East-West conflict that was fought in the form of proxy and guerrilla wars in Asia and Latin America. However, one aspect of this confrontation is often forgotten: the United States and the Soviet Union also set their sights on Africa, which became a new arena for their power struggle, against the backdrop of decolonization. \nLeft-wing political forces gained strength in African countries in the 1960s. Moscow seized the opportunity and invested heavily in East African Somalia, for example. The situation was similar in Angola. And Moscow triumphed.\nWith Ronald Reagan as the new president, the United States began preparing its return to the African continent in 1981. The timing was favorable, as communism had been devastating in Africa: the collectivization of agriculture in Ethiopia, for example, led to a famine that cost 500,000 people their lives. \nAs more and more African countries turned away from the Soviet model, Moscow could only stand by and watch. Ultimately, Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms could not prevent the collapse of the USSR in 1991.\nThe end of the East-West conflict offered many countries in Africa the opportunity to take control of their own destiny once again. However, to avoid being exploited and manipulated by world powers once more, the continent had to learn the lessons of the Cold War era.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Opioids have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. While headlines often blame illegal drug trafficking by Latin American cartels, the crisis actually began 30 years ago, quite legally, in the United States.  \n\nThe Sackler family, former owners of Purdue Pharma, brought the highly addictive painkiller OxyContin onto the market, unleashing one of the greatest health disasters in US history. Using hundreds of sales reps, they pressured doctors in poorer areas to prescribe the drug. This is considered the first wave of the US opioid crisis.\n\nIn 2025, the Sackler family reached a deal to pay $7.4 billion over 15 years and give up all control of the company. They are also barred from selling opioids in the United States.

But maybe the biggest divide in our politics is the insider vs. outsider divide.\n\nThat’s only gotten more noticeable in recent months, as issues like the Epstein files and artificial intelligence have pitted the elites against everyone else. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) is at the center of both of those issues. He wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He brought one of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse survivors to this week's State of the Union address. And he’s coined the term “the Epstein class” — the group of wealthy and connected individuals that he wants to bring to accountability. Even if they’re fellow Democrats.\n\nKhanna represents Silicon Valley in his district, so he has worked with companies like Google and Meta for years. That puts him at the forefront of one of the important political and economic questions of the coming year: Is AI about to put us all out of work?

This number is probably just the tip of the iceberg. In most cases, the crimes are not reported - whether out of shame, fear of the perpetrator, or mistrust of the police and the justice system.\n\nIn the west of the country, in the wealthy and conservative state of Gujarat, the story of 17-year-old Kinjal portrays an India in which rape is apparently considered a \"trivial offense.” \nThree years ago, the young girl, who belongs to the Dalit community - a group considered \"untouchables,” who occupy the lowest social status, at the bottom of the caste system -- was raped by the son of a landowner from a higher caste. \nTo cover up the incident, the rapist's family offered Kinjal's parents land and 100,000 euros - a fortune. But Kinjal's father rejected the compromise, preferring to take the case to court. \nThis rare act of courage was considered an affront by the higher castes. As a sign of his struggle, he decided not to cut his hair again until the perpetrator was convicted. \nKinjal and her family were supported by Manjula Pradeep. The activist, who is also a Dalit, has dedicated her life to defending women who have been raped. Her goal, as yet unattained, is that each victim she helps will be the last. \nFor six months, a camera crew accompanied Kinjal and her family in their search for justice. A glimpse behind the scenes in India, where the violence of the caste system and the weight of tradition determine the lives of hundreds of millions of women.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #india \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This has already had an impact on the internal and external security of Western countries. How dependent is Germany on China?\n\nFancy some iced tea? It'll be delivered by drone. A tree falls onto the road? The driverless taxi swerves out of the way. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automation in the megacity of Shenzhen shows how high-tech China is integrating innovation into everyday life. Digitalization is everywhere, in a country where administrative procedures are carried out via mobile phone. \nBut the example of Shenzhen also shows that western countries are in danger of being left behind by China in key technologies such as AI, robotics and electric cars. \nBehind all this advancement lies a great deal of state planning - as well as possible attempts to exert influence. \nThis film shows how China is creating economic and technological dependencies, for example when it comes to so-called \"rare earths\" and \"technology metals.” These are not only indispensable for photovoltaics, wind power and robotics: Many armaments also depend on these raw materials, which are supplied almost exclusively by China.\nChinese manufacturers of batteries and electric cars are also focusing on Hungary as a location to conquer the European market. Factories are being built there, partly to circumvent EU customs duties. The country is actively courting Chinese investment. Within the EU, Hungary repeatedly blocks tougher measures against China. This is putting pressure on Germany's automotive industry.\nThe film explores the question of how dependent Germany is on China and what risks this poses for security and cyber security. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this global power? China competes with the US for leadership in the world, and has long been a security policy challenge for the West. The documentary looks at the two countries’ economic ties, political goals and interrelations -- down to the hyper-local level. Experts from Europe, the US and China provide insights and answers.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #china #europe \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This community manages to run a high-output, multi-million dollar enterprise while intentionally remaining disconnected from the internet and the local power grid. \n\nThe Amish are not a single group. Each Amish community follows its own set of rules, known as the Ordnung, which determines what tools and technologies are allowed. These decisions are made collectively and are based on whether something strengthens family life, faith, humility, and community, or undermines them. \n\nWhile Roy manages a nationwide furniture business that generates millions in annual sales, he adheres to these religious principles by choosing an e-bike over a luxury car.

With a vast army of 30,000 troops, 15,000 horses and 37 war elephants, he crossed the mighty Alps in only 16 days to launch an attack on Rome from the north. For more than 2,000 years, nobody has been able to prove which of the four possible routes Hannibal took across the Alps, and no physical evidence of Hannibal’s army has ever been found… until now. In Secrets of the Dead: Hannibal in the Alps, a team of experts – explorers, archaeologists, and scientists – combine state-of-the-art technology, ancient texts, and a recreation of the route itself to prove conclusively where Hannibal’s army made it across the Alps – and exactly how and where he did it.

An unsolved mystery. Until now. Writer-director Joe Medeiros, former head writer of The Tonight Show, traces the path of Vincenzo Peruggia, charged with the 1911 theft of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa from The Louvre, and finds the story of a daughter mourning the father she never knew and a country recovering from old wounds. Combining historical photographs, animation and interviews with Peruggia’s descendants, Medeiros answers why and how the man called ‘Macaroni’ by his French co-workers absconded with and kept the legendary painting for two years. This riveting, often humorous documentary portrays a man struggling to find his way in the world and make his family proud.

This technology for producing fresh water was a blessing for the islands. Now, it could prove to be a curse for the ecosystem.\n\nThis water treatment system is essential for life in the area - but is it compatible with the principles of sustainable development?\n\nDue to limited freshwater resources and rising demand, the first seawater desalination plant in Europe was built in the Canary Islands. It is often touted as a perfect solution. Today, the Canary Islands have the highest number of desalinations plants in the world, relative to the islands’ size and population. \n\nThe fresh water obtained in this way is indispensable for human life on the volcanic islands, but - since it appears to be available in abundance - it also encourages unbridled economic development, such as mass tourism and the intensive monoculture of bananas for export. \n\nMoreover, seawater desalination is anything but climate-neutral. The plants consume vast amounts of electricity from fossil fuels. The brine returned to the sea destroys marine life and contributes to ocean acidification. \n\nThe film sheds light for the first time on this region's dependence on desalinated seawater. The documentary also explains how water desalination works, and the various impacts that need to be considered.\n \nAware of the urgent need to protect nature, their own health and the future of their children, the Canarian people are working together with scientists to find alternative solutions for sustainable water management. \n\nThanks to decades of experience, the Canary Islands are now leaders in the field of seawater desalination, and their technical expertise is in demand worldwide. In view of increasingly frequent droughts due to climate change, the extraction of drinking water using this technology is becoming a matter of survival for an increasing number of people.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #canaryislands #water \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice dive into fan questions about optics, religion, communicating with entanglement, and life on Earth after humans. \n\nNeil explains why the speed of light doesn’t always go as fast as the speed of light.  You’ll learn about evanescent waves, the index of refraction, and why light behaves like a focused New Yorker navigating a sidewalk full of tourists when passing through molecules. We explore how anti-reflective coatings work, how total internal reflection keeps photons trapped, and why visible light can’t get through a brick wall while other wavelengths pass through with ease.\n\nChuck shares his theory on whether the expansion of the universe is caused by pressure bleeding in from the outside, while Neil discusses the upcoming Europa Clipper mission and our search for life in the solar system. What if there’s life elsewhere in the universe? What if we’re alone? We reflect on Chuck’s experience with religion and Giordano Bruno, the 16th-century monk who was martyred for suggesting the stars were suns with their own planets, and how religion often requires the world to be smaller. \n\nHow do you detect a gravitational wave if the instrument you’re using to measure also warps with the spacetime? Neil explains how LIGO was designed to fix this issue. Learn about the possibility of using quantum entanglement to communicate from inside a black hole, and why special relativity means that to a passenger on a train, it's actually Grand Central Station that is moving. Does Neil care about time capsules? We take a look at a post-human Earth. Finally, find out why Neil believes the only cure for the existential blues is the sound of bagpipes playing \"Amazing Grace.\"\n\nThanks to our Patrons Jules, Kelton Falls, Danielhero 11, Zaubergarden, Danilo Vieira Battistini, Brian Lacroix, Charles Baker, Matthew Krug, Chris A, Sandra Leduc, Rodney Schneider, Sir Sucknoramus, Dominik Zwahlen, Malachi Vanderpuye, Zac, Will Johnson, John DeGrey, ClumsyVirtuose, Holly Sweet, Chuck Montana, Jeffrey Holt, Stephen, Extronox, Jon, Ben Grund, Jona Smith, Christopher Zalenski, Wile E Coyote, Stephen Patterson, Amber Johnson, Cameron Clark, D.

Could the New Year's blaze in Crans-Montana that claimed 41 lives and left 116 people injured have been prevented?\n\nNew Year's celebrations ended in tragedy at the Le Constellation bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana. Swiss investigators believe that sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to sound insulation foam on the basement ceiling. The flames spread within seconds, turning the basement of the bar - a popular party location - into a death trap. \n41 people died as a result of the blaze and 116 people were left injured. Many of the mostly teenaged victims sustained severe burns. That night was the start of a living nightmare for the families affected. \nThis documentary accompanies some of the parents whose children were left critically injured and now face long hospital stays far from home, uncertain outcomes and the daily struggle to keep hope alive. \nOne young survivor also describes what she went through that night and how it has affected her. The psychological wounds run deep: anxiety, trauma and feelings of guilt. She is plagued by the question of why she survived when others died. \nThe film shows how initial reactions of shock and dismay quickly turned to outrage after revelations that human blunders and safety shortcomings may have led to the blaze. The investigation and legal proceedings are only just getting underway, but the mental and emotional impact is already overwhelming.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #swiss #switzerland \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The discussion reveals that effects are composable operations that encapsulate side effects and defer execution, giving developers the right handles to manage unpredictability through compiler-checked types.\nThe authors explain how ZIO tracks three critical types: outputs, failures, and environmental requirements, enabling better testing with mock clocks and random number generators.\n\nThey share their intentional avoidance of intimidating functional programming terminology like \"monads\" proving you don't need mathematical foundations to understand effects. The conversation covers effect systems' expansion beyond Scala into TypeScript, Kotlin, and new languages like Unison and Roc, and how their collaborative writing process with strict constraints like 47-character line limits - created a coherent 100-page book readable in portrait mode on your phone.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBill Frasure, Bruce Eckel, James Ward • Effect Oriented Programming • https://amzn.to/4sO6wLV\nBruce Eckel &amp; Svetlana Isakova • Atomic Kotlin • https://amzn.to/4qT1gEQ\nBruce Eckel • Thinking in C++ • https://amzn.to/4qnrIGW\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Matt reveals the mystical stories of the High King’s of Ireland, including the formative leader Brian Boru. But it’s not just Boru who has a direct link to Tara, one of Ireland’s most famous people is said to have come here…St Patrick. Patrick is believed to have performed miracles challenging the old pagan rulers, bringing christianity to the island of Ireland. Tara remains a magical place, even today. \n\nBut Ireland wasn’t to be ruled by High Kings forever...In 1167 the Normans invaded. For years they fought for control. By 1176 they gained enough land to cement their power in stone…in castles! \n\nMatt heads to one of the biggest castles in Ireland, Trim. Trim sat on the frontier of Ireland, a symbol of English dominance over the Irish populace. It was built by the Norman Lord, Hugh De Lacy. De Lacy used Trim as his powerbase to control this area of Ireland through force and ideology. The Normans portrayed the Irish as barbaric people who they should conquer and ‘civilise’. Matt explores an incredible ancient manuscript that reveals exactly this. The Topographia Hibernica could be called the first piece of colonial propaganda in Ireland, aiming to justify the subjugation of of Irish land and people. But it wasn’t just through ideology and propaganda that the Normans could invade this green isle, it was the weapons and force they brought with them too - Matt discovers the brutal weapons that backed up their fortresses.\n-\n-\n-\nLove Castles and want to find out more?

An invisible poison — lead — has been destroying lives in Zambia for decades.\n \nHeadaches, fatigue, stomach pain, memory loss — for many people in Kabwe, Zambia, all that is part of daily life.

The United Nations ranks Kabwe among the most polluted places on Earth. Around 200,000 people are affected. Nearly every child has dangerously high levels of lead in their blood.\n\nWe met mothers like Jane, whose 6-year-old daughter Elizabeth struggles to keep up at school because of lead poisoning.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

On one level, it’s great that more people are meditating. But somewhere along the way, the whole thing got flattened. When mindfulness is mainly about optimizing your output, we’ve probably missed the point.\n\nToday’s guest is Jon Kabat-Zinn, pioneer of the American mindfulness movement and author of the mega-bestseller Wherever You Go, There You Are. Jon’s work helped bring meditation into medicine, schools, sports, and everyday life. He’s also spent decades reminding people that mindfulness isn’t about escape, self-improvement, or becoming some perfectly serene version of yourself.\n\nSean and Jon talk about what mindfulness actually is, why being present is so damn hard, and what happens when industry turns meditation into another tool for self-optimization.\n\nThis episode originally aired in December of 2023.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life.\n\n00:00 Intro\n03:02 Mindfulness vs. mindlessness\n13:12 What to do when you have a lapse in attention\n19:36 The mindfulness industry\n34:10 Recognizing this moment\n36:46 A meditation led by Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\nWe would love to hear from you.

Affordable housing, social networking, and childcare services are designed to ease the burden.\n\nSingle parents in Europe can increasingly rely on help and support from people, associations, and institutions to help them balance raising children with work, financial issues, and mental overload. \n\n\"A secure, affordable living situation - that's such a key issue in the lives of single parents,” says Sarah Zeller. A few years ago, she found herself confronting this issue when, along with another friend and her child, she decided to set up a shared apartment for the two single parent families. But they searched in vain for an affordable apartment with enough space. \n\nThis predicament gave rise to an innovative approach. In 2015, the German native founded the non-profit association JUNO in Vienna. Working with property developers, the association plans and develops compact and affordable apartments for single parents. With her idea, the founder has now helped over 160 families find a suitable apartment. \n\nThe Belgian region of Wallonia has set itself the goal of strengthening the social position of single parents. Amandine Dedoncker is a social worker involved in the \"Relais Familles Mono” program, creating services tailored to the needs of single parents. The government program enables single parents to learn practical skills, meet other mothers or fathers, and be part of a community. As a population group particularly affected by loneliness, this is extremely important for single parents‘ mental health. \n\nWhen other families have free time, on Saturdays Bianka Baumann is at work: in a supermarket in Rostock. The single mother and sales assistant works weekends. But who looks after her son Linus, during a time when most daycare centers are closed? An innovative daycare center here makes her weekend work possible by offering overnight care for parents who work night shifts. \nAll of this is financed by the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A model that supports single parents - and makes it possible to truly balance work and family life.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #family #singlemom #singledad \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

By analyzing the 30 to 40-year gap between the events and their recording, the documentary examines the transition from oral tradition to written text. We delve into the lives of key figures like Peter, Mary Magdalene, and Judas Iscariot, using historical context and scholarly research to separate theological construction from the real people who walked the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago. \n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

Newly evaluated archive material, eyewitnesses, and experts document the extent, background, and consequences of this warfare.\n\nA little-known chapter of colonial violence: The French army secretly used chemical weapons against independence fighters during the Algerian War (1954-1962). Maps, documents, and eyewitness accounts from French and Algerian veterans document the dimension of this warfare, as well as the human suffering it caused. \n\nInterviews with experts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons explain how military and political decision-makers organized these secret attacks. In addition to the torture and displacement of entire population groups, the use of chemical weapons constituted a huge breach of France's international obligations. Obligations France deliberately disregarded during its colonial war. \n\nStep by step, the film reveals the impact of this warfare on Algeria’s land and people. The film illuminates both the historical events, and their current relevance.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #frenchcolonialism #colonialism #algeria \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We dive into the \"Victory Paradox\"—the irony that Bitcoin’s institutional acceptance through Wall Street ETFs and a \"crypto-friendly\" presidency has tethered it to traditional financial risks, destroying its status as an uncorrelated asset. From the $12 billion losses at Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. and the liquidity crisis at institutional prime broker BlockFills to the Great AI Pivot in the mining industry, we break down the structural traps currently paralyzing the ecosystem. Featuring insights on \"Financial Nihilism\" from Demetri Kofinas, the \"Juggalo Theory\" of crypto subcultures from Zeke Faux, and the massive migration toward prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, we ask the ultimate forward-looking question: now that Bitcoin is fully financialized, will it ever be an independent asset again?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":1984,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Xhrzm4CmpEo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Unboxing a Gamakay TK75HE V2 keyboard!","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5j9wsGEW4A","date":1771653646,"author":"Chyrosran22","guid":97,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Erratum; this is in fact HE, not TMR. \nGet it here: https://gamakay.com/products/gamakay-tk75he-v2-8k-polling-rate-rt-accuracy-hall-effect-keyboard 12% off with code \"gk12\"\nToday we unbox a board, one very different from the Monsgeek one I unboxed recently, even though it looks similar.

What is it like to stand on the threshold of death — and turn back? Three young women talk about their near-death experiences and how these moments changed their lives.\n\n\"I used to be extremely afraid of death. But ever since my near-death experience, that's no longer the case,\" says model Chanel Silberberg, who became famous through the German reality TV show \"Germany's Next Topmodel.\" She nearly died at the age of 11 from complications related to a chronic illness. The experience fundamentally shaped her.\n\nWhy do near-death experiences have such a lasting impact? This documentary shares the dramatic and inspiring stories of three young women who stood on the brink between life and death and returned with a completely new life perspective. Their background stories are vastly different: Laethisia Schimek is a competitive athlete; Léa Winzenried is a dance therapist; and Chanel Silberberg is a model and influencer. What all three have in common is an awareness of the finiteness of life, and a drive to experience it to the fullest. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Frances shares her unique teaching philosophy, which emphasizes self-contained, playable examples like simple games that make complex concepts accessible and memorable.\n\nDrawing on her background in mathematics and her father's work in teacher education, she explains how her approach—exemplified by her famous \"X Out of a Y Paper Bag\" series of talks—uses humor and practical scenarios to help learners understand challenging topics like coroutines, the spaceship operator, and the \"almost always auto\" style. The discussion touches on the evolution of C++, the upcoming reflection features in C++26, and Fran's current project: writing an introductory C++ book for complete beginners, despite finding concepts like \"constant variable\" challenging to explain even as an experienced author.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:48 Why modern C++ needs a new approach\n07:03 Teaching through games &amp; examples\n11:41 Coroutines in C++\n14:50 \"almost always auto\" &amp; modern C++ style\n22:04 Teaching &amp; writing: A family tradition?\n28:44 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nFrances Buontempo • Learn C++ by Example • https://amzn.to/4rgxSZX\nFrances Buontempo • Introducing C++ • https://amzn.to/40aHQQC\nFrances Buontempo • Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning for Programmers • https://amzn.to/3OLjXMV\nDaniel Kusswurm • Modern Parallel Programming with C++ and Assembly Language • https://amzn.to/4o5J3SF\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Cpp #CppProgramming #CppProgramminglanguage #Coroutines #ConstantVariable #Cpp26 #Compiler #AlmostAlwaysAuto #ModernCpp #CompilerExplorer #TodayInTech #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #FrancesBuontempo #MattGodbolt #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

But green technologies require critical raw materials, which often come from China. Is more mining in Europe a viable solution?\n\nEurope wants to encourage economic growth, while also saving our planet from climate collapse. The name of the plan to do this is the \"Green Deal.” Under the Green Deal, electric cars are supposed to replace combustion engines, and renewable energies will be used instead of coal, oil, and gas. \nBut green technologies require many critical raw materials, like lithium and rare earths. But these raw materials are rarely mined in Europe anymore. Currently, they come from faraway places like Africa, South America, Russia, and above all, China.\n \nThe ensuing dependence poses a risk to the European economy. Politicians and industry leaders now want to bring some mining back to Europe. They promise green, sustainable mines with as little impact on the environment as possible. But in places where these types of mines are being built, people are fighting back. They fear that their regions will be sacrificed for the energy transition.\n\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #rawmaterials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nIn “The Hugo Chávez Show,” FRONTLINE traveled to Venezuela to offer an illuminating portrait of the country’s  then-president, Hugo Chávez. Through interviews with former government officials, Chávez associates and critics, and ordinary Venezuelans, FRONTLINE chronicled how Chávez ascended to power,  how he became a dominant figure in recent Latin American history, and how he used broadcast media to spread the “21st-century socialism” he espoused.\n\nMemorably, the documentary introduced U.S. viewers to “Aló Presidente” — or “Hello, President” — a weekly televised show that often ran five to eight hours and featured Chávez speaking directly to the people, explaining government policy and mixing in a smattering of songs, poetry and whatever else struck his fancy. Beyond being a venue for Chávez’s personality, the program served as a weekly window into the Venezuelan government, with Chávez often announcing major policy decisions on live television.\n\nWith Venezuela in the headlines following the U.S. government’s capture of Nicolás Maduro, who was Chávez’s protege and successor, “The Hugo Chávez Show” offers important context on Venezuela’s political history and the accomplishments, failures, appeal and repression of the Chávez era.\n\nPraise for “The Hugo Chavez Show”:\n“This portrait transcends news events.” – David Montgomery, The Washington Post\n“An even-handed, unillusioned view of a highly perplexing figure.” – Mark Feeney, The Boston Globe\n“A fascinatingly revealing documentary.” – Kate Taylor, The Globe and Mail \n\n“The Hugo Chávez Show” is a FRONTLINE co-production with Ofra Bikel Productions.

Could we use gravitational waves to detect dark matter? \n\nAs we warp into the world of Star Trek, we examine how the franchise tracks real-world scientific milestones, from genome sequencing to the legacy of Vera Rubin. We break down the 100% efficiency of matter-antimatter annihilation, the theoretical math behind the Alcubierre warp drive, and why tachyons are a \"get out of jail free\" card for writers breaking causality. Could spacetime itself violate the speed of light? Plus, Sasheer shares what it’s like growing up with Trekkie parents and being named after a piece of Federation lore.\n\nFinally, we dive into the \"Superasymmetry\" of The Big Bang Theory and the storytelling trade-offs you have to make in science fiction. Is everything symmetrical in physics? From 3D printers bringing us closer to replicators to the societal impact of Nichelle Nichols, we look at how science fiction provides a cosmic perspective on the future we are currently building.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Kevin Lee, Meeka, Orlando Cruz, Landyn Blankenship, Gargoyleb, Matthew, Alex Anderson, MageLord, Akash Akash, Munch, Moien, Clarence Jones, Julie Harden, Thomas Cruz, Mike Nold, HEY JUDE BACA, Terry Melman, Zerain, Susan S, Jody Minx, Connor Wolanski, Dom, Aaron Alter, Scotty, Rawan Brou, Myrthu, Sean Smith, Roderick Van Nooijen, Clarence Jones, George Knapp, Lev Pickovsky, David, Jonathon Widmer, Keith Kimura, Wayne Terry, James Kovacs, CM Blake, C.M.

It increases your risk of diabetes, heart attacks, cancer, and can lead to a series of other health complications. But today, the new weight loss drugs are changing people’s lives in a way no diet ever has before. They seem to melt fat away, reduce addiction and even prevent or reverse the negative effects of obesity.\n\nHow do these drugs work?

I simply wanted to make art history accessible, stumbling into success with over two million subscribers along the way. And now, a book! \n\n“In a world of noise and distraction,” I say in my book, “great art slows us down. It demands attention, reflection, and interpretation. It doesn’t exist to give us easy answers—but it does give us better questions.”\n\nIn this illustrated talk, I bring my signature storytelling and striking visuals to explore celebrated artworks not as distant masterpieces, but as creations shaped by real people, real pressures, real ambitions. Through visual analysis, historical context, and human stories, I reveal how art intersects with power, class, money, religion, politics, and everyday life. No academic jargon. No dense theory. Just essential questions: Why was this made? What did it mean then? Why does it matter now?\n\nThroughout the talk, I encourage and guide the audience to slow down and really look. Details often missed in galleries are brought into focus, helping viewers understand how artists guide the eye, create meaning, and communicate emotion. As much as it is about learning facts, the talk is about learning how to look.\n\nThis is art history as it should be: open, democratic, relevant.\n\nCopyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

He discusses how Chainguard tackles this problem by building everything from source using Wolfi, creating minimal \"distroless\" images with near-zero CVEs, and how concepts like SBOMs, attestations, and defense in depth are reshaping security practices.\n\nThe conversation also covers major security incidents including the XZ Utils backdoor and Shai-hulud attacks, emphasizing the importance of building from source, using short-lived credentials, and replacing rather than updating containers – practices pioneered by companies like Google that are gradually spreading across the industry.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:02 Early adoption of containers\n02:12 The problem of outdated packages\n05:21 Understanding scanners &amp; vulnerabilities\n09:39 Google Distroless &amp; the beginning of Chainguard\n14:39 Wolfi &amp; building from source\n20:14 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) &amp; attestations\n27:01 Defense in depth &amp; best practices\n34:32 The XZ utils backdoor\n38:14 Resources\n38:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAdrian Mouat • Using Docker • https://amzn.to/3PEYIJL\nLiz Rice • Container Security • https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe\nLiz Rice • Kubernetes Security • https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-security/9781492039075\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Chainguard #Cybersecurity #Security #Wolfi #GoogleDistroless #SBOM #SoftwareBillOfMaterials #XZutils #ShaiHulud #ShaiHuludAttack #Containers #ContainerSecurity #Docker #DockerSecurity #TodaInTech #AdrianMouat #CharlesHumble\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Is the universe one predetermined block? Neil deGrasse Tyson and cohosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly answer grab bag questions about quantum theory, the cosmological constant, and retrocausality with astrophysicist Charles Liu.\n\nWe explore a question about the Big Rip, quarks, and whether tearing the universe apart could spark a brand-new Big Bang. We break down why phantom energy would be required, what dark energy might be, and why current observations suggest the universe probably won’t rip itself to shreds even though we still don’t know what 95% of the cosmos actually is. Could the cosmological constant be changing over time?\n\nCan light help us reconcile relativity and quantum mechanics? We discuss the work of Jacob Barandes at Harvard and whether the \"duality\" of light is the lynchpin to a unified theory. Are today’s mathematical tools just placeholders for physical phenomena? Questions about retrocausality, block time, and whether the universe already exists in full spark reflections on science fiction, free will, and the experiments we can’t yet perform.  Could extra dimensions provide a mathematical loophole for the laws of physics?\n\nWe confront quantum consciousness head-on. Is consciousness rooted in quantum mechanics? Could it persist beyond physical change or even death? We explore philosophical perspectives on Penrose’s ideas, AI consciousness, digital copies of the self, and why “I don’t know” remains the most powerful phrase in science. Along the way: pseudoscience, vaccines, human ignorance, collective behavior, spiritual experiences, and a final reminder that curiosity is what moves us forward.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Jules, Kelton Falls, Danielhero 11, Zaubergarden, Danilo Vieira Battistini, Brian Lacroix, Charles Baker, Matthew Krug, Chris A, Sandra Leduc, Rodney Schneider, Sir Sucknoramus, Dominik Zwahlen, Malachi Vanderpuye, Zac, Will Johnson, John DeGrey, ClumsyVirtuose, Holly Sweet, Chuck Montana, Jeffrey Holt, Stephen, Extronox, Jon, Ben Grund, Jona Smith, Christopher Zalenski, Wile E Coyote, Stephen Patterson, Amber Johnson, Cameron Clark, D.

This is a painting designed to be decoded.\n\nUnlike Renaissance harmony (think Leonardo or Raphael) this painting feels tense, airless.

We analyze why the FBI is still hiding crucial investigation files—like the 302 victim statements—while Ghislaine Maxwell receives a mysterious prison upgrade and offers conditional testimony. The names are finally out, but as this investigation proves, the cover-up is far from over.\n\nIn this video we ask who are: Les Wexner and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.  Since the video was released after being questioned by The Guardian - the Department of Justice said that four of the men have no connection to Epstein whatsoever, but rather appeared in a photo lineup assembled by the southern district of New York (SDNY). https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/four-men-unredacted-epstein-files-no-ties-ro-khanna\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2186,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/cvOuN5KqufE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"NFL hall of famer on what players knew about CTE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8uAuTDDOGo","date":1771016430,"author":"FRONTLINE PBS | Official","guid":335,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Former New York Giants linebacker Harry Carson, who was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome and advocated for other players to join a lawsuit against the NFL over brain injuries, discusses why he regrets ever playing football.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

Sam, a software developer with 30 years of experience spanning companies from startups to AWS, shares his approach to applying clean architecture principles with Python while maintaining the language's pragmatic nature.\n\nThe conversation explores the balance between architectural rigor and practical development, the critical relationship between architecture and testability, and how clean architecture principles can enhance AI-assisted coding workflows. Sam emphasizes that clean architecture isn't an all-or-nothing approach but a set of principles that developers can adapt to their context, with the core value lying in thoughtful dependency management and clear domain modeling.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSam Keen • Clean Architecture with Python • https://amzn.to/4pBT5g0\nFabrizio Romano &amp; Heinrich Kruger • Learn Python Programming • https://amzn.to/4myLBIt\nUncle Bob • Clean Code • https://amzn.to/3soPO6k\nUncle Bob • Clean Architecture • https://amzn.to/3x0gjBQ\nEric Evans • Domain-Driven Design • https://amzn.to/3tnGhwm\nNaomi Ceder • The Quick Python Book • https://amzn.to/3zwdDOa\nLuciano Ramalho • Fluent Python • https://amzn.to/3oSw2je\nDavid Beazley • Python Distilled (Developer's Library) • https://amzn.to/3QjNBEv\nSaleem Siddiqui • Learning Test-Driven Development • https://amzn.to/35OMb3n\nMaciej «MJ» Jedrzejewski • Master Software Architecture • https://leanpub.com/master-software-architecture\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

If today's quantum computing manufacturers achieve their roadmaps, RSA-2048 will be broken within the next few years. Beyond a sea change for encrypted communications globally, this heralds the arrival of a new era of HPC workflows and the possibility of solving heretofore unsolvable problems.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the current state of research into what applications might come online first, the nascent ecosystems for delivering them, and the call to action to all developers to prepare for Q-Day and beyond!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are joined by planetary astrobiologist David Grinspoon to discuss NASA’s return to Venus, our space future, and whether we’ll find life in our solar system. \n\nAs a primary investigator on the upcoming DAVINCI mission, David explains why we haven't sent a dedicated U.S. mission to our sister planet since the 1980s and how the history of \"space futures\" has always been a reflection of our own culture and politics. Neil and David explore the evolution of our planetary visions, from the mass delusion of Martian canals and Jules Verne's moon voyagers to the propaganda efforts during and before the Apollo era. You'll learn how people once assumed every planet was inhabited, only to have their \"cloud swamp\" dreams shattered by the harsh reality of a runaway greenhouse effect.\n\nWhen did scientists realize Venus’s runaway greenhouse and that it wouldn’t have life?  We get into the nuts and bolts of the DAVINCI (2031) and VERITAS missions. How do you build a probe to survive pressures 100 times that of Earth and temperatures hotter than a pizza oven? David breaks down the dive through the Venusian atmosphere, where the mission will capture the first-ever 21st-century measurements and descent photography of the surface. \n\nThey also tackle the phosphine controversy: Could life actually thrive in a permanent global cloud deck? Why isn’t there life in the clouds on Earth, even though you can find life everywhere else? \n\nWith the Europa Clipper heading to Jupiter’s icy moon and the OSIRIS-REX sample from Bennu revealing 14 different amino acids, the kit for life seems to be sprinkled across the cosmos. If the ingredients are common could life itself be too? \n\nThanks to our Patrons Nick Pullia, Sean Cater, Keith Reiss, Seph Gordon, Charlie Viola, Miguel Rangel, Andrew Ferguson, JeAnnette Elaine Thomas, Hugh Caley, Daniel Weber, Chris, Peter Grossman, Darryl Baker, Joyce A Edwards, Maxim, Joshua Richard, Patrick ridlon, Kathleen Reardon, David Watts, Angelina Bryant, Liza, Dave Holloway, Ricardo Andrés Morales Muñoz, Damian Wilson, m. szachacz, Vince Johnson, Lucy, Randal Walcott, Rachel Ambrose, andrew wong, Richard Hudson, Peter Galindo, Mehdi Degryse, Carl Starr M.D., Rodrigo De Luca Comelli, Christian Harris, Ryan Grillo, Jose Villavicencio, Kell, Russ, Mota Ephrahim, Andre Campos-Gomez, Catherine Noiboonsook, Sam McClure, Jerry Taylor, Ian Howarth, Gerrard Lobo, Jordan Strauch, Pretender to the Throne, Dustin, Bulbacats, Jim Mirra, Matt, Adrian Martinez, GuruMojo - Kenny, Malcolm Townes, Russell, Vincent Thomas, Caleb Winters, Carsten, Frank, Andrew Sabado, Roger beeper, Jason Burden, lilacjasminetea, Eric, Samantha, Eric Sneddon, philip griffiths, Christian Chidester, Bruce Berky, Bill Polskoy, Maddux Hammer, Tim Neumark, nathan burcl, Paul Santos, Tognia, sugar, Mike Vacay, Niklas lundkvist, JaneB, Gutek, Natalie &amp; Dad, Ashley, J Sh-Wood, Alexej Muehlberg, and Emery for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: David Grinspoon\n02:15 - History of Space Futures\n04:42 - Growing Up with Carl Sagan &amp; Star Trek\n10:30 - Portrayal of Aliens\n12:40 - Popularizing Space\n17:59 - Realizing Other Planets Didn’t Have Life\n20:00 - Mars Canal Conspiracy &amp; War of the Worlds\n25:42 - Going Back to Venus with DAVINCI\n33:30 - Could Life Thrive in the Clouds?\n39:04 - The Health of the Search for Life\n41:33 - What We Found on Asteroid Bennu\n45:09 - Do Aliens Have Music? \n49:20 - Closing Thoughts\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

We dive into the “Social Ponzi Scheme” that enabled decades of abuse, exploring the suspicious real estate transfers, cryptocurrency custodian links, and the international criminal probes that are currently toppling political giants across the globe. From the high-level PR strategies of the “Wall Street Renaissance Man” to the harrowing evidence of a eugenics-obsessed operation, we explore why this long-awaited transparency should not be confused with actual justice. As it turns out, when the powerful retreat into “vast carelessness,” it is often because they have spent years building a system designed to silence the questions they cannot answer.\n\n@2lazy2tryYT Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT9td3FJxj8&amp;t=68s\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2071,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/e-tapKoT1K0?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Timeline 1961 - Everything That Happened In The Year 1961","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDy9ZTbBQHc","date":1770562883,"author":"Weird History","guid":684,"unread":true,"content":"<article>1960 brought South Korea’s April Revolution massacre, South Africa’s Sharpeville massacre, and the most violent race riot in the history of Mississippi, everyone was hoping 1961 would be a little more chill.

An investigation from FRONTLINE in partnership with The Associated Press, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Post and Courier and AL.com.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you.

But accumulating research has linked some kinds of PFAS to serious health problems. In few places is this issue more pronounced than northwest Georgia, home to some of the world’s largest carpet companies, and now grappling with an environmental crisis.  \n\nThis story unfolds in “Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy,” a documentary investigating how PFAS chemicals once used in making stain-resistant carpets ended up in the environment and the drinking water in parts of Georgia and Alabama, and the ongoing health impacts. \n\n“Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy” is part of a groundbreaking multiplatform investigative collaboration among local and national news organizations. Over much of the past year, the consortium of journalists reviewed thousands of pages of documents and court depositions and interviewed former regulators and industry insiders, as well as doctors, scientists and people who have the kinds of illnesses that researchers have linked to PFAS contamination. \n\nThe carpet industry has long insisted it’s not to blame for PFAS getting into the environment and noted that chemical companies obscured the risks and assured them the products they were supplying were safe. But recently reviewed records also show that executives from two of the largest carpet companies received warnings dating back decades about potential harms of some types of PFAS.\n\nThe companies say they stopped using any kind of PFAS in U.S. manufacturing in 2019. But since PFAS takes so long to break down, communities fear that decades of use of these forever chemicals have made their drinking water unsafe — and local governments say the problem is too vast for them to fix alone.\n\n“Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy” is a FRONTLINE production with Five O’Clock Films in association with the AP, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, AL.com and The Post and Courier. The writer, director and producer is Jonathan Schienberg. The producers are Kate McCormick and Dana Miller Ervin.

The $14 billion deal, brokered by a consortium of politically connected investors, was supposed to end the years of national security concerns and protect the data of 170 million US users. Instead, the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture has stumbled out of the gate with a series of \"technical glitches\" that look suspiciously like targeted censorship. From the inexplicable blocking of the word \"Epstein\" in direct messages to the suppression of protest videos in Minneapolis, the new management’s first week has raised a troubling question: did we actually solve the problem of algorithmic manipulation, or did we just ensure that the people doing the manipulating are the ones who helped broker the deal?\n\nThis video examines the bizarre political U-turn that turned TikTok from a national emergency into a sweetheart deal for insiders. We look at the new owners, the incredibly invasive \"biometric harvesting\" hidden in the new Terms of Service, and the \"Rational Business Actor\" theory that suggests no company would be dumb enough to break its own product on day one. We also explore the \"Mecha-Hitler\" problem of content moderation, and why the \"National Security\" label may now be acting as a permanent shield against transparency for a platform that is now 100% domestic, 100% private, and perhaps, 100% MAGA.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2390,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/n_wNCLdlV7w?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["yt"]}
