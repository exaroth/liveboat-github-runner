And it’s paying off, with a network of ports providing strategic advantage amid rising global trade tensions.\n\nBut this unparalleled influence is also sparking security concerns.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

The US company puts pressure on retailers and exerts influence on pricing policies, thus fueling cut-throat competition.\n\nAmazon attracts customers with low prices - but according to a former manager at the company, the reason for this is not what consumers might think. She claims that the company's aim is not to give customers fair deals but to put retailers and manufacturers under enormous pressure.\n\nThis investigative documentary reveals the questionable methods used by the company: suppliers are prevented from selling their products below the Amazon-listed price - whether that be online or in a physical store.

In April 2012, a team of Historic Jamestowne archeologists discovered something surprising.

In a society that's predominantly focused on outward appearance, hair wields huge social capital. It can either elicit admiration — or turn into a problem.\n\nA full, glossy head of hair is synonymous with beauty, youth and vitality. But what happens when that hair loses its shine? As we age, our hair gets thinner, alters its structure or falls out. Can anything be done to address these changes? How do we learn to be content with the hair we have — or with no hair whatsoever? Are hair transplants worth the bother?\n\nThis documentary observes people for whom hair is of particular importance: an actor who is happy to be bald, a man who decides to have a hair transplant and a hair artist whose hair can do incredible things, such as supporting her entire body weight. This is due to the structure of hair: each individual strand consists of numerous protein spirals linked together by chemical bonds. That makes it incredibly elastic and highly stable: a single hair can hold up to 100 grams without breaking.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #hair \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A big one is to find other places in the universe that might harbor life. We only know of one such planet so far: Earth. And so we get particularly excited when we find Earth-mass planets at the right distance from their star to sustain liquid water—also critical for life as we know it. We’ve found lots of those “habitable” worlds. But we also don’t know what factors are really critical to the initial development of life. Maybe star type? We get even more excited if that Earth-mass at the right distance from a Sun-type star.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

Addicts remove the gel from pain patches and inject it directly into their bloodstream. There have been dozens of fatal overdoses in Poland. Michal has also lost one of his close friends. Corrupt pharmacists are believed to have sold large quantities of fentanyl patches to dealers. The authorities have since put a stop to this.  \nIn Żuromin, Jadwiga Karpinska lost her son Pawel to a fatal overdose. Their town, a two-hour drive from the capital Warsaw, was known as the country’s unofficial fentanyl capital in 2024. That changed when police detained a well-known local dealer. The drug continues to be available there, but in smaller quantities.\nElementary school teacher Adam Ejnik believes in prevention. He wants to keep his students away from the drug by raising awareness about its dangers. \nArtur from Łódź has managed to get off fentanyl. A few years ago, he was so addicted, he had lost the will to live. Today, his girlfriend Agnieszka helps him stay clean. His goal: he hopes to finish his psychology degree and work as a therapist to help other addicts get off the extremely powerful drug.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #poland #fentanyl \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Since then, the Blackfoot have endured a century long campaign of oppression and persecution from the United States government – a brutal and violent experience that they are only now healing from.\n\nBring Them Home follows a small group of Blackfoot who are working to right these historic wrongs by returning wild bison to their lands – an act that would heal people, re-enliven traditional culture and bring economic opportunity to their community.\n\nBut this mission has been thwarted at every turn by cattle ranchers, internal politics and the legacy of colonialism. If this opposition is successful, not only would bison never return to the wild, but it would threaten decades of work to reintroduce traditional tribal culture, language, livelihood – in essence it would complete a process started two centuries ago, a death of their spirit.</article>","contentLength":2072,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Dey6j27CJtM?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How a Scam and Chinese Spy Scandal Rocked the Philippines","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OERBzEtAj0","date":1764025205,"author":"Bloomberg Originals","guid":27,"unread":true,"content":"<article>In 2022, a small town in the Philippines elected its first female mayor, a popular figure named Alice Guo who brought prosperity and new business to the area.

The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.\n\nYemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. \n\nA proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.\n\nFollowing Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.\nBetween blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #yemen #houthi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

It dives into the themes of morality, gender roles, disease, illicit sex, and the societal pressures depicted in Victorian art. The Victorian era presented the world with an image of domestic bliss and moral rectitude - the 'Home Sweet Home' myth. This documentary shatters that facade, exploring the hidden realities of 19th-century Britain. From the strict, prison-like confines of the family home for women to the dark secrets of adultery, prostitution, and terrifying epidemics like syphilis and scarlet fever, we uncover the moral hypocrisy that gripped society. Featuring rare access to Victorian anatomical models and shocking true crime stories, this is the complex, dark history behind the respectable image.\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

The unlikely journey has brought hope to a country with rare reason to celebrate while illuminating the complex politics of the Taliban's relationship to cricket.\n\nCricket has grown into a vital part of life in Afghanistan - offering glimmers of joy and excitement to the countless Afghans that play and watch the game. And while the stunning achievements of the men's national team have fostered unity and hope, the Taliban's return to power means half of the country is barred from the festivities and many female players were forced to flee their homeland. \n\nIn a crisis-ridden country like Afghanistan, cricketing success is both deeply meaningful to its people and a complex political challenge, presenting the Taliban government with an opportunity to use the sport at home and abroad. Cricket has offered star players like Gulbadin Naib a path from childhood refugee camps to international acclaim, while all over the country young players like Jamal Stanikzai dream of one day taking part in the team's success. For Afghan refugees like former women's national team player Firooza Amiri, cricket is both a beloved sport and a form of resistance.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, Gary O’Reilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu explore force fields, warp drive, invisibility, and quantum physics behind superhero powers. \n\nIf Superman swoops in to catch a falling Lois Lane, wouldn’t she hit him like a bug on a windshield? Could his physiology, including his digestive system be super too? And what would happen if Superman’s methane-packed farts met his heat vision? The gang imagines a literal human flamethrower. How can Superman see colors with x-ray vision? \nNeil recalls DC Comics once asking him to help Superman find Krypton in the night sky, raising questions about how long it took Superman to get here. Could he have traveled through a wormhole? Or warped spacetime like the Enterprise? Charles explains why folding space might be harder than warping ourselves, and how Miguel Alcubierre’s warp bubble could one day make sci-fi travel real.\n\nWe break down the science of invisibility. What would it mean to be truly unseen? The crew explores stealth technology, light-bending metamaterials, and quantum invisibility. Learn about invisible forces, like the Casimir effect and how quantum fluctuations affect our world. We break down how the Flash can walk through walls. If atoms are mostly empty space why aren’t we falling through the floor? \n\nLearn about quantum teleportation, and whether we can use entanglement for quantum communication. We dive into the quantum realm itself with the fictional Pym particles, Dr. Manhattan’s wave function, and the many-worlds theory that spawns infinite universes every second. Neil wonders if that’s a scientific breakthrough or a cosmic cop-out. Charles closes with wisdom: as our knowledge grows, so does the perimeter of our ignorance. In a universe where every possibility happens somewhere, God doesn’t just play dice—He plays all of them at once.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Dave, Downtime Coffee, David, Colby Bechtold, Carlo Gomez, Mark Hanley, zach, David Bishop, Danielle Grant, Brian Petrunik, Micheal, Private Name, Dustin Hurtt, O.C, Cris Martinella, Václav Pechman, MrMcMuffinJr, Matthew Reagan, Kellie, Christopher Peffers, Vishal Ahmed, Chris Hodgins, Linda Nguyen, Ben F, Kirk, Charles Spence, Kirk, Zack Fay, Dave Lora, Mark Wilson, David Gaston, Emily Keck, Julian Walker, Samantha, Mikeland, Amy, M Rrr1994, Daniel Carter, Bill Holub, Craig Crawford, Rajkumar Polepaka, Tom Mison, Neil Disney, Tomas fridrik, Kurt Hayes, GA Armistead, Andrew Hagan, Jordan Wagner, Mai Tai, Ross Walker, Jonathan Price, FatDunb'Murican, Ann, Isaac Bicher, Michael Tiberg, Darrell Messer, Jeff Smith, Kimberly V Silver, Joe Jenkins, Phillips Williams, Archie, Andrew Wery, Jacob Hernke, John Ryan, Arthur Forlin, Tom Jenkins, Mario Miranda, Douglas, Heather Jones, Mancheno, Marcus Lowe, Mister Sandman, Brand0n Rs, Raj Sivakumar, Ryne Thornsen, Sean Doyle, BRAD BRIDGEWATER, Paul Bernard, Karl Desfosses, Kody Remer, Greg Scopel, Sriti Jha, Tim Enfinger, Jacob Glanville, Rilee Jensen, David W., Micheal Austin, Carlos Alberto Gonzalez, JOSH SHE-BONG, George, and Geezapouch for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Charles Liu\n05:09 - Superman Catching Lois Lane\n07:28 - Superman’s Super Digestion\n11:23 - X-Ray Vision\n13:37 - Neil’s Adventure with Superman\n18:25 - Wormholes &amp; Warp Drive\n24:38 - The Power of Invisibility\n29:58 - Force Fields &amp; The Casimir Effect\n36:38 - How Empty is an Atom?\n40:10 - How to Run Through Walls\n43:23 - Quantum Teleportation &amp; Absolute Zero\n53:00 - Getting Larger &amp; Smaller\n56:12 - Superposition &amp; Entanglement\n1:02:52 - Many Worlds Theory\n1:10:28 - Practicality with Quantum Physics\n01:14:40 - A Cosmic Perspective\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

For a long time, scientists believed insects acted mostly out of instinct and weren’t particularly intelligent, in part, because most of them only live for a few weeks. But it turns out, the insect world is far more complex than we previously thought.  \n\nMany insect species have brains the size of a grain of rice, but are still able to store images, shapes, colors and experiences, and can even learn new skills and work with tools.  \n\nIn many species, individual insects even develop unique traits and personalities, like bravery or aggressiveness. One reason for this could be that species with diverse individuals can better adapt to environmental changes, giving them an evolutionary advantage for survival. \n\nWatch the full documentary “Smart insects - The astonishing intelligence of bumblebees, wasps &amp; co.” on the DW Documentary YouTube channel.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #insects \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

From its beginnings right through to the present day, the country's armed forces have shaped both American identity and the political decisions of its leaders.\n\nThe United States of America has been at war throughout most of its 250-year existence. From the War of Independence right through to contemporary armed conflicts, the nation's armed forces have not only shaped American identity but also influenced the political decisions of its leaders.\nThe documentary takes a deep dive into this complex history and analyzes the \"hot\" and \"cold\" wars that have shaped US history in order to draw important lessons for the future.\n\nThe film explores how successive generations of US Americans viewed and experienced each conflict. It also examines the enduring impact of these wars on American society and reveals how military engagement was utilized to hone the image and the role of the US on the global stage.\nAround 30 high-profile experts, military personnel and politicians examine the military history of the United States, explaining its successes and failures, as well as its impact on the world and the everyday lives of Americans.\n\nThe film looks to the past to gain a keener understanding of how today's military decisions will affect tomorrow's world — as well as their far-reaching impact on democracy and society. And with US President Donald Trump now in office for a second term, it asks what role the army plays in Trump's world view.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #usa #war \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Her most recent book is Lidia’s From Our Family Table to Yours which was released in October 2023, a companion to her new 26-part public television series, Lidia’s Kitchen.

The images of high-ranking Nazis in the dock are seared into our collective memory.\n\nThe Nuremberg trials were a series of military tribunals staged by the Allies after World War Two. The first and best-known trial ended in October 1946 with the sentencing to death of 12 high-ranking Nazis.  Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, Hermann Göring, Germany’s foreign minister during the Nazi regime, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Armaments Minister and chief architect Albert Speer, anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher and high-ranking SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner were among those in the dock. The court met for the first time in Nuremberg in November 1945 and was in session for 218 days.\nBy making the Nazi elite answer for their crimes in this hugely complex trial, the Allies ushered in the era of modern international law. Using photos and archive film material, the documentary reconstructs what went on in the court room, as well as revealing what went on behind the scenes. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #nurembergtrials \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

But now, 30 years after they first got here, they’ve been spotted hundreds of kilometers upriver. They can’t really outcompete larger predators, but in places with little competition, they’ve been hard to stop. Crayfish reproduce incredibly fast – a single female cay lay hundreds of eggs, leaving locals, scientists and conservationists scrambling for ways to stop its quick spread and preserve their local ecosystems.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

New discoveries are helping to challenge that idea.\n\nAfter centuries buried beneath the soil, the graves of Anglo-Saxons are unlocking the secrets of these elusive people, revealing a civilisation far more complex than history often remembers.\n\nToday medieval historian Matt Lewis returns to The University of Bradford to team up with Osteoarchaeologist Dr. Jo Buckberry to investigate the remains of three individuals who lived and died in Anglo-Saxon England and who, in death, may help reveal the truth about life in early medieval Britain\n\nImages of Plan of Raunds from, Boddington, A. provided by Historic England Archive (30:10:00)\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

While the LGBTQ+ community has battled to secure its place in urban centers, out in the provinces, worlds frequently collide.\n\n\"I could move to the big city like so many others do, but I want to make a difference.\" Eric is gay and lives in a small town in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where he struggles to find acceptance. Especially when he organizes the region's first Pride parade. \"The district is a right-wing stronghold. Many people around me are concerned and afraid,\" he says. Against all odds and defying prejudice, Eric goes ahead with the Pride event, amid a large police presence. Will the celebration pass off peacefully in this small town? \"I used to know many people who actually think homosexuality is a disease,\" says Eric.\n \nFor a long time, Tina, who comes from a small village in the Black Forest region, struggled to accept herself. When she wanted to have a child, she moved back to her home village with wife Sarah. But with four generations living under her parents' roof, the couple is finding things hard: \"We did wonder if it would work out, because you're moving to a village and leaving the anonymity of the big city behind,\" says Tina.\n\nChristian is also about to leave Berlin to live with his fiancé Jens in a small village in Mecklenburg. They plan to live in a house that Christian has inherited, but until now the building has housed the village’s only pub - which has had to close to make way for the couple. Will they ever find acceptance in the village?\n\nWhen Joe came out as non-binary around two years ago and started wearing skirts and makeup, it was mainly Joe's mother who had to field questions from people in the small East Frisian village where they live. Joe is keen to change their name on their official ID, in line with Germany's Self-Determination Act, but the registry office is uncooperative. \"It was one of the worst phone calls of my life,\" says Joe. But they are not giving up.\n\nThe documentary allows viewers to witness quiet struggles as well as moments of solidarity. It demonstrates that social change and acceptance can develop outside of urban centers. Rural communities, too, can be places where queer people find ways to assert their place in society.\n\n[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide.

This 2010 documentary investigates the controversial death penalty case of Cameron Todd Willingham — and the scientific validity of the arson evidence used to convict him of the deaths of his three children. \n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nThe execution of Cameron Todd Willingham in Texas in 2004 became the center of a national debate about the death penalty and the science behind arson investigations.\n\nDrawing on unique access to those closest to the Willingham case, “Death by Fire” meticulously examines the evidence used to convict Willingham, and explores the implications of the execution of a possibly innocent man.\n\nThrough interviews with Willingham’s friends and family, the documentary tells the story of a troubled young man with a history of domestic violence who quickly became the prime suspect in his children’s deaths. The discovery by fire investigators of more than 20 indicators of arson at the scene of the fire pointed directly to Willingham’s guilt.\n\nBut the re-examination of the case turned on a critical finding that came only weeks before Willingham’s scheduled execution: The investigators who determined that he had set the fire that killed his three daughters had relied on an outdated understanding of arson evidence. \n\nExperts told FRONTLINE there could be hundreds of innocent people in prison for arson cases where the evidence was misinterpreted by investigators.\n\n“Death by Fire” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group in association with StartBox Films. The producer and director is Jessie Deeter. The writers are Mike Wiser and Michael Kirk.

In this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice answer fan questions covering higher-dimensional surgery, space elevators, alien intelligence, and colliding galaxies. Could spacetime itself be a cosmic crystal? \n\nCould 2D creatures exist, and if so, how would we even know? If 4D beings turned sideways, would we disappear like cartoon characters? We wonder whether we could make 4D surgeons do our operations for us. Could the Trantor Starbridge from Foundation actually work? Neil explains the physics behind a space elevator, how it would reach geostationary orbit, and why the dream faded once rockets got efficient. Chuck wants to know what kind of music you’d play during the world’s longest elevator ride. \n\nIf a superintelligent alien could answer any one question, what would you ask? Neil wonders if the human brain is smart enough to understand the entire universe, or are we just too dumb? Can learning happen without human connection? Neil argues that even an AI tutor can’t replace the ever-changing human condition. What makes spacetime flat? Can there ever be a “universal now”? \n\nWe ask whether you’d need absolute coordinates to return somewhere, factoring in the expansion of the universe. Finally, we explore the cosmic heavyweights: supermassive black holes. Could they swallow entire galaxies? What happens when two galaxiesand their black holes collide?

Has German politics shifted for Syrians? | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abw9VdCkw_o","date":1763485230,"author":"DW Documentary","guid":3,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Sulaiman Tadmory came to Germany in 2015 after fleeing the civil war in Syria. With dictator Bashar al-Assad and his regime now gone, he's one of thousands of Syrians wondering whether it's time to return home.\n\nIt’s been ten years since Tadmory left Syria. Now, a German citizen, he’s embarking on a personal journey to find out whether his future lies in his adopted country or his homeland. Does he feel there is a place for him in Germany amid growing racism, including calls for \"remigration\"? And does the Syria he grew up in still exist after 13 years of war?\nIn addition to visiting his native city of Homs, Tadmory also speaks with other Syrians in Germany who come from a variety of backgrounds and have differing opinions on the big question. They include Mohammed in Dortmund, a metalworker who has decided to go back to Syria for good under the German government’s voluntary return program; Leen, a student living in Berlin, who believes that Germany - despite political tensions and challenges - remains the safest place for her; and Maher, a dentist in Münster who, along with his German fiancé, is developing an emergency \"Plan B,” in case the German far-right AfD party gains control of the government. \nTadmory is torn. He wants to stay in Germany, but would return to Syria if his mother were deported.\nCan and will Germany ever feel like home? If so, under what conditions? These questions resonate not just with Tadmory, but with countless other migrants who have built a new life in this country. And he also poses these very questions to the politicians who are shaping both public discourse and policy. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #germany #refugees #deportation \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Moving beyond the \"AI will replace developers\" narrative, they reveal how AI assistants excel at the tedious work of typing, scaffolding, and error handling while remaining surprisingly bad at the nuanced thinking that experienced developers bring to complex systems.\n\nTheir discussion illuminates a more mature relationship with AI tools: one where developers maintain agency over design decisions while leveraging AI's strengths in automation, synthesis, and rapid prototyping. The result is a pragmatic roadmap for using AI to amplify human expertise rather than replace it.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDiana Montalion • Learning Systems Thinking • https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nAndrew Harmel-Law • Facilitating Software Architecture • https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nDonella H.

But, what are your options when going home isn’t one? In recent decades, Friendsgiving has emerged as the go-to choice as an additional event or complete alternative to Thanksgiving. \n\nIt can be tough during the holidays with the pressures of trying to get everything just right to present yourself as a well-adjusted adult hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, or to be present with family that may think they know what’s  best for you. Friendsgiving has opened the door to do things a little bit differently. The intention is to have a laid-back, low-pressure (or over-the-top, totally up to the host) potluck-style dinner with friends and other people in your chosen community — because as cheesy as it sounds, friends are the new family. \n\nFriendsgiving was seemingly plucked from obscurity in the 2010s. While its exact origins are debated, it was likely widely practiced prior to its fame on The Real Housewives of New Jersey in 2011. Even then it took a few more years for it to pick up steam in the media. \n\nWatch this video to learn how Friendsgiving went from a friendly potluck dinner to a cultural mainstay.\n\nThis video is presented by T-Mobile 5G Home Internet.

Is it possible to reverse this global trend by using water more sparingly in households, industry, and agriculture?\n\n\"Water is an important but not an infinite resource,\" warns Dorothea Mergel, a project engineer at Hamburg's water company, adding that water is becoming increasingly scarce both in Germany and around the world. Mergel is working to make sure that the drinking water supply in Germany's second-largest city is sustainable. One idea is a pilot project in which \"gray water\" - wastewater from our showers and kitchen sinks - is used to flush toilets and water gardens, thus saving precious drinking water.\n\nIn Tunisia, every drop counts - especially in agriculture. The country has a high proportion of desert, with temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius in summer. Agricultural scientist Dr. Bellachheb Chahbani has developed a method of traditional irrigation that reduces water use by 70%. Dr. Chahbani visits olive farmers in the south of the country, helping to set up the water-saving system.\n\nIndustry has the potential to save enormous amounts of water, too. Water conservationist Andreas Kirketerp works at the Carlsberg Brewery in Fredericia, Denmark. His innovative system recycles the water used to clean bottles, cans, equipment, and tanks, making it usable again. The saving amounts to 1,800 cubic meters of water every day - or the daily water consumption of around 14,000 people. The effect on the local drinking water supply has been hugely positive.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #water #drought \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

From the end of the 19th century, through the dawn of the Atomic Age and past the rush of the Space Race, the future was painted as a place of possibility and optimism.\n\nBut now?\nNot so much. Our view of the future lies somewhere between neutral and gloomy.\n\nWhy the change?\nThat question has come up almost every time our Program Committee has met. Back in the good old days the future was always bright. Innovation and craftsmanship was blooming. Failure not a topic.\n\nSo, if the future is not what it used to be, what is it?\nIn this keynote, PC members Kevlin Henney and James Lewis will look at the future seen through the eyes of the past.

With rare access to gang recruits, police, politicians and families caught in the crossfire, this documentary explores efforts to stem the violence and the human toll.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nOnce one of Latin America’s most peaceful nations, Ecuador has now become one of its most violent. Foreign cartels have joined with local gangs to control the drug trade, funneling cocaine to the U.S. and Europe, and pushing the homicide rate in the country to record levels. In response, Ecuador’s government declared a state of emergency in 2024, and sent the military onto the streets and into gang-plagued prisons to crack down. \n\n“Drug War in Ecuador” illuminates the stark human toll of it all, drawing on deep access to those involved in the struggle, from the military and police to the gangs to the families caught in the crossfire. The film focuses on the stories of three people: Father Jose Antonio Maeso, a well-known gang violence mediator  who also collects evidence of alleged abuses by the police and military; Colonel Javier Buitron, then governor in Esmeraldas, a hotbed of gang violence, who defends the government’s crackdown; and Ronny Medina, a grieving father who’s seeking justice for his 11-year-old son, Steven, one of four boys who were found dead after the military detained them. Ecuador’s military said the soldiers released the boys alive and gang members later killed them.  \n\nRaw and profound, the documentary offers a powerful look at the ongoing crisis in the country.\n\n“Drug War in Ecuador” is a Duskwater Films production for GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV in association with The Big Story Films. Filmed and directed by Marcel Mettelsiefen. The producers are Stephen Ellis, Marcel Mettelsiefen, Mayte Carrasco and Ahisha Ghafoor. The associate producer is Esme Ramlal.

The film explores the stark human toll of the country’s drug and gang crisis, which has caused homicide rates to skyrocket — and also examines allegations that the military has “disappeared” innocent people in the resulting crackdown.\n\nIncluding Steven. \n\nAs the above video drawn from the documentary shows, surveillance footage from December 8 in Guayaquil, Ecuador, captured the military detaining Steven and beating another boy. Steven’s charred remains and those of three 14- and 15-year-old boys he was with — Nehemías Saúl Arboleda, Josué Arroyo and Ismael Arroyo — were found on Christmas Eve. Ecuador's military said the soldiers released the boys alive and that gang members later killed them. A judge ordered 16 soldiers to be put in detention. The soldiers who picked up Steven and the other boys are currently on trial for their role in the deaths.\n\nFor the full story, watch \"Drug War in Ecuador\" starting Nov. 11 on @frontlinepbs. \n\n\"Drug War in Ecuador\" is a Duskwater Films production for GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV in association with The Big Story Films.

Decision was made that was unique in history. There would be an international trial convened in the German city of Nuremberg. The senior Nazis men like Hermann Goering, would be placed in the dock. And the trial that followed would change the course of history.\n\n00:00:00 The Crimes\n00:03:10 The Trial\n00:05:31 The Defendants \n00:13:49 Why Nuremberg \n00:18:00 The Charges \n00:20:45 Keeping the Defendants Alive\n00:26:00 The Verdicts \n00:27:00 Goering Escapes The Noose \n\nWant to see more?

It offers a compelling exploration of this pivotal moment in history, including peace and crimes against humanity. The Nuremberg trials went on to become arguably the most famous trials in history, bringing some measure of justice to the millions persecuted and devastated by the Nazi regime.'\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

If your “modernization” effort stopped at lifting-and-shifting monolithic apps into Kubernetes, you’ve simply boxed yesterday’s problems in today’s tech.\n\nIn this session we’ll unpack why true modernization demands more than orchestration stickers: it requires re-architecting for event-driven, serverless, and AI-augmented patterns that slash time-to-value and operating costs. Drawing on field experience across 50+ enterprise and startup transformations—spanning 8,000+ AWS Lambda functions, real-time data pipelines, and GenAI copilots.\n\nWe’ll explore:\n• The Illusion of Progress: Hidden technical debt and cost traps that containers often preserve.\n• Transformation Levers: Domain-driven decomposition, serverless services, and managed data layers that free teams from infrastructure toil.\n• GenAI as a Catalyst: Where large-language-model capabilities amplify modernization ROI—and where they don’t.\n• Change Management Playbook: Culture, skill-matrix, and governance shifts that let teams iterate safely at cloud speed.\n• Success Metrics &amp; Case Studies: Concrete KPIs (release frequency ↑ 5×, infra spend ↓ 60%) from healthcare, QSR, and fintech modernizations.

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nFor three decades, Dick Cheney had been an advocate of granting the president virtually unlimited wartime power. In the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, with Cheney as George W. Bush’s vice president, the Justice Department and the White House made a number of controversial legal decisions. Orchestrated by Cheney and his lawyer David Addington, the department interpreted executive power in an expansive and extraordinary way, granting Bush the power to detain, interrogate, torture, wiretap and spy — without congressional approval or judicial review.\n\nIn “Cheney’s Law,” a documentary by Michael Kirk and his team, FRONTLINE examined the battle over the power of the presidency and Cheney’s way of looking at the Constitution. As the White House and Congress faced off over executive privilege, the terrorist surveillance program, and the firing of U.S. attorneys, FRONTLINE told the story of what formed Cheney’s perspectives and what some at the time viewed as the most ambitious project to reshape the power of the president in American history.\n\nExplore additional reporting on “Cheney’s Law” on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/cheney/\n\n#Documentary #Politics #DickCheney\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline \nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

This documentary investigates how they got there, looking at the reasons behind the surge in support for their brand of hardline nationalist politics and the roles of Russia and the U.S.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nSupport for nationalist, anti-immigrant parties has surged across Europe in recent years — including in Germany, where far-right leaders have risen to the brink of power for the first time since World War II.\n\n“The Rise of Germany’s New Right” examines the recent political ascendance of the country’s far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party — exploring how it has targeted younger voters using AI videos that play on fears about immigrants and crime, how it has called for the “remigration” of immigrants who entered Germany illegally and others who had been given temporary right to stay, and how it has won vocal support from influential figures including Elon Musk and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. The documentary also probes allegations that Russia boosted the AfD through what one journalist calls “disinformation warfare.” \n\nAs the film details, after World War II, Germany set out to reckon with its grim history, in part by banning Nazi symbols and slogans and criminalizing Holocaust denial. A political “firewall” was also established, with mainstream parties vowing not to work with far-right parties to govern. The documentary details how, decades later, members of the AfD have pushed back against this “remembrance culture,” become the second largest party in Germany’s parliament, and are calling for the dismantling of the “firewall,” arguing it has no place in a democracy.\n\nDrawing on interviews with numerous AfD politicians, German intelligence service officials, political scientists, and journalists, “The Rise of Germany’s New Right” examines how and why the country reached this moment, and what it says about broader trends across Europe.\n\n“The Rise of Germany’s New Right” is a FRONTLINE production with Mongoose Pictures in association with Evan Williams Productions. The correspondent, reporter, producer and director is Evan Williams. The producer is Hannah Congdon. The senior producer is Dan Edge. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.\n\nExplore additional reporting on ”The Rise of Germany’s New Right” on our website: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/the-rise-of-germanys-new-right/\n\n#Documentary #Germany #Politics\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline \nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs​\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and is broadcast nationwide on PBS.

Inside, they found fake tickets for a one-way flight out of Germany on election day, designed to look like real airline boarding passes. In the field where a passenger’s name would ordinarily appear, the fake tickets read instead: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nAs this video drawn from the new FRONTLINE documentary \"The Rise of Germany's New Right\" explores, the “deportation tickets” were part of an ad campaign by Germany’s far-right, nationalist Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party. Tens of thousands of the flyers were distributed in mailboxes and at election campaign stands  — sparking accusations that the AfD, known for its polarizing use of rhetoric, was promoting racial hatred and echoing a grim Nazi-era history in which fake one-way tickets to Jerusalem targeting Jewish people were reportedly distributed as propaganda.\n\n“It has been reported that this particular type of ticket was very reminiscent of what the Nazis did with the Jews,” FRONTLINE correspondent Evan Williams says in the video to Marc Bernhard, the AfD official behind the campaign. “This hasn't come from nowhere in the German context. How do you respond to that?”\n\n“Yeah, well, I'm not familiar with these actions,” Bernhard responds. “To be honest, I don't know them, nor was I aware of them.”\n\nFor the full story, watch “The Rise of Germany’s New Right” Nov. 4 on @frontline's YouTube channel, in the PBS App, at pbs.org/frontline and on PBS stations. The documentary investigates how far-right leaders in Germany have risen to the brink of power, looking at the reasons behind the surge in support for their brand of hardline nationalist politics, and the roles of Russia and the U.S.\n\n“The Rise of Germany’s New Right” is a FRONTLINE production with Mongoose Pictures in association with Evan Williams Productions. The correspondent, reporter, producer and director is Evan Williams. The producer is Hannah Congdon. The senior producer is Dan Edge.

From the Mountain Pass mine in California to Apple’s $500 million recycling push, we unpack the strategic importance of rare earths in everything from electric vehicles and smartphones to fiber optics and missile systems.\nWe also look at the recent Trump–Xi summit, the temporary truce on export controls, and the deeper tensions that remain unresolved. Why are rare earths so hard to substitute? How does China’s export licensing regime work?
