But little attention is paid to it by the media and the international community. Estimates put the number of victims in the millions, with no end in sight.\n\nAll parties in the conflict seem to be trapped in a spiral of violence. The disputes are over power, money and access to the country’s valuable natural resources.\n\nBelgian film director Thierry Michel has been travelling throughout the Congo with his camera for over 30 years. He has witnessed the struggles and suffering, but also the hopes of the Congolese people. In the film, the speech by doctor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege outlines the story of the relentless violence that has devastated and destroyed the Congo for so long.\n\nNone of the actors in this drama are spared in this uncompromising film - from Congolese rulers, to neighboring countries, to international institutions. The film draws on the UN Mapping Report, which records the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003. The report names the perpetrators, which caused unease and was kept secret.\n\nThe film paints a contrasting picture of a country caught between outrage and solidarity. It speaks out in favor of coming to terms with history, and against forgetting. The film aims to play a role in setting the record straight. After decades of impunity, the film shows, those responsible for crimes must be brought to justice.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

On the one hand, lambda calculus is supposed to compute anything that can be computed. On the other hand, many intensional computations, such as deciding equality of programs (terms in closed normal form), are not definable within lambda calculus. The paradox has now been resolved by close reading of the original papers and books, which clarifies that lambda calculus is inherently extensional.\n\nMore importantly, there are new, intensional calculi which are more expressive than lambda calculus. First, pattern calculus supports both higher-order functions and generic queries of data structures, by basing all computation on pattern matching. Second, SF-calculus can query programs as well as data structures by factoring them, using the operator F. In particular, the Goedel number of a program can be defined within the calculus itself.Third, lambda-SF calculus adds native support for lambda-abstraction to SF-calculus.

They consist mainly of deciduous trees. One tree has a very special role to play: the oak.\n\nFor the Celts, the oak symbolised the connection between the spirits of heaven and earth. In fact, the tree is perfectly adapted to the changing seasons: In autumn it loses its leaves, in winter it rests under a blanket of snow and in spring it begins to sprout anew. Its fruits are a tasty treat for wood mice, wild boar, squirrels and jays, all of which help to spread the oak seeds. High in the branches, green woodpeckers and bats thank the tree for its hospitality by ridding it of the parasites that prey on its wood and leaves.\n\nThe shy lynx also serves the oak well, defending it from the deer and ibex that love to nibble on its shoots. Beneath the ground, the oak lives in symbiosis with fungi, which provide it with vital nutrients. Ecologists, biologists and fungal researchers explain the connections between these fascinating interactions. The secret of the success of the highly resilient temperate forests lies in their biodiversity. Unfortunately, they are increasingly being replaced by pure conifer plantations, which meet the demands of the highly standardized timber industry but deplete the soil, causing numerous species to migrate. In view of industrial timber construction practices and the expansion of urban centers, the question arises: is the oak really as immortal as people claim?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Grady Booth said “It’s rubbish”, Kent Back said “The report is so absurd and naive that it makes no sense to critique it in detail” and Daniel Terhorst-North said, “Don’t try to measure the individual contribution of a unit in a complex adaptive system, because the premise of the question is flawed”.\n\nIn this episode software engineer and author, Dave Farley joins in with the critique, and while agreeing with Kent Beck on most things, does look at the report in some detail to critique it. He finds that the McKinsey developer productivity article is as useless and ill-informed as the reactions of many other industry experts would suggest.\n\nMcKinsey Article:\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity#/\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS & LINKS\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nDavid Farley • Modern Software Engineering • https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley & Jez Humble • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nForsgren, Humble & Kim • Accelerate • https://amzn.to/367RI5o\nGojko Adzic & David Evans • 50 Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories • https://leanpub.com/50quickideas\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #DeveloperProductivity #McKinsey #Requirements #Programming #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #Complexity  #ProgrammingTutorial #SoftwareEngineering\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley’s returning to front line service in the conflict.\n\nSecond is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.\n\nThird up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.\n\nLast but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren’s box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition. \n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

The mission put a man on the moon for the very first time, winning the Space Race for the United States.  \n\nThe rocket that made it possible was Saturn V. As tall as a 36-story building, it was the most powerful that had ever flown, symbolising American technological dominance during the Cold War. \n\nAnd yet, the man who designed it had a dark past. During the Second World War, he had been at the forefront of the Nazi Secret Weapons programme, designing weapons which cost thousands of lives. His name was Werner von Braun.\n\n*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film “The woman in the moon” (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film (used for illustrative purposes in the video) was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it’s technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work. \n\nLearn more about Lewis' work at lewisbush.com\nYou can order his book on Werner von Braun, Depravity's Rainbow, here: shop.lewisbush.com\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video: https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_GAE5zrAe\n\n\"Werner von Braun\" Written and performed by Tom Lehrer - Public Domain\n\nAttributions:\nBundesarchiv, Bild 146-1978-Anh.024-03 / CC-BY-SA 3.0\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nx.com/I_W_M\ninstagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nfacebook.com/iwm.london","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/zu1G_0BBAlg?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Lightning: Nature’s Plasma Highway #shorts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCAm38dSD78","date":1735830056,"author":"Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell","unread":true,"content":"Lightning is like a super hero movie.

An eruption would have catastrophic consequences.\n\nIf an eruption does occur, it’ll be a race against time. So, with the help of modern measuring techniques, researchers are seeking to identify early warning signs. If they can better understand the processes taking place inside the Earth, it’ll help them predict an eruption. This, in turn, would allow affected areas to be evacuated in time. \n\nIn the past 2.1 million years, the Yellowstone Supervolcano has erupted three times - most recently, some 600,000 years ago.

This film takes a look into the largely closed-off world of the country's millionaires and billionaires - and at how the wealthy see themselves and their privileged lifestyles.\n\nWe talk to the CEO of a luxury watchmaker who says German industry suffers from overregulation, with insufficient rewards for taking risks. A well-off building contractor from Dusseldorf, on the other hand, explains how most of the country's millionaires acquire their wealth not from entrepreneurship, but from inheritance. He wants to see a drastic rise in tax rates for the rich, and the proceeds invested where they're needed, e.g. in infrastructure and education.\n\nThis documentary also shows life at the Salem boarding school, where the wealthy pay tens of thousands of euros a year to send their children to school. For many, their education includes learning to take on the responsibility involved in later running their family-run businesses.\n\nThe superrich live longer and enjoy special tax benefits. The suspension of a wealth tax in 1997 has reportedly cost the German state €380 billion in lost revenues. With the country facing a financial crisis, will its most prosperous individuals live up to their responsibilities that come with privileged financial power?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They're a social hub that helps create a sense of community.\n\nIn Germany, people from all walks of life often stop by local pubs, convenience stores, kiosks, and corner shops as part of their daily routine. These places are becoming increasingly vital for personal interaction in a society where many feel isolated and lonely. How can these social hubs help bridge divides and foster a sense of community? What challenges do they face? Jana Oertel and Bettina Stehkämper explored Berlin’s vibrant convenience store culture and visited traditional kiosks typical of the Ruhr region — establishments that serve as much more than places to shop and take care of errand. Their journey also took them to the eastern German town of Wechmar, where a group of volunteers saved a local pub from closure. Now, it serves as a community hub, bringing people together for special monthly pub evenings — a testament to the role such spaces can play in strengthening social bonds.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #reporter\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The name can be roughly translated as \"cold place.\" The film tells the story of three women: the farmer Hanna, the postwoman Maria and the biologist Nelya.\n\nIn the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, the three protagonists must grapple with their social reality - and loneliness. Very few young people live here, but the elderly women are deeply rooted to their village and its surroundings. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.\n\nIn a tiny kitchen, Hanna shares her feelings of loneliness with the filmmakers, who she says remind her of her deceased sons. At the village post office, post woman Maria has neither stamps nor heating, but customers are warmed with liquor and songs. Somewhere in the woods and caves, biologist Nelya looks for the animal droppings that are a treasure to her. The film portrays an unknown place at the heart of Europe, where people make a daily choice - stay or leave?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly’s have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!\n\nIs humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?\n\nNext, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity’s urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation—until it doesn’t. What happens to a photon’s energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe’s edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck’s constant would do to the universe. \n\nWas human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity’s ultimate motivator?\n\nCould alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made \"Matrix\"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?\n\nFinally, we explore humanity’s potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their \"Matrix\"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?\n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Chuck and Gary’s Burning Questions\n01:43 - Are We Going to Merge with Machine?\n06:41 - Redshifting to Infinity\n07:59 - If You Could Change Physics\n12:28 - Could We Have Gone to the Moon in 1700? \n21:45 - AI & Energy\n24:51 - How We Use Electrons as a Wave\n28:41 - Are The Aliens Trapped in the Matrix?\n33:19 - Does Physics Prevent Us From Living Forever? \n36:07 - Communicating with Aliens\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century. And with air-passenger numbers predicted to double in the next 20 years, it also looks at what the industry will have to do to keep up.\n\nThis is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes.

They’re concerned by the issue of animal welfare. But a primary motive is the ecological impact of industrial livestock farming.\n\nIndustrial livestock farming is responsible for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It also requires huge amounts of land and water and is thought to be contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. This is why more and more scientists and entrepreneurs are conducting research on alternatives to conventional meat production.\n\nIn California, Joshua Tetrick is working on a method of growing meat in a bioreactor. He multiplies the muscle cells of chickens in huge tanks and cultivates them with plant-based nutrients. The resulting cell pulp is molded into fibrous meat with the help of a plant scaffold. A kilo still costs many hundreds of dollars. But Joshua Tetrick hopes that production can be scaled up to a globally relevant level. After all, with ‘Good Meat’ he was one of the first two companies in the USA to receive a license for cultured meat.\n\nAt the University of California, Alison Van Eenennaam is trying to make meat production more efficient.  Using the gene editing tool CRISPR she’s altered the genetic make-up of a cow so that its offspring are exclusively male. This is a great advantage, as male calves grow faster and consume fewer resources than female calves to produce the same amount of meat - thereby reducing the carbon footprint of livestock farming. \n\nFor Pasi Vainikka from ‘Solar Foods’ in Helsinki, these are all just intermediate steps on the way to a truly sustainable future food: he’s cultivating a whole new category of food in gigantic fermenters: Bacteria that are fed with CO2 and hydrogen and blended to create a product called ‘Solein’. A flavorless, protein-rich basic ingredient that can replace eggs and milk in practically all foods.\n\nScience journalist Ingolf Baur meets some of the researchers and entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to industrial livestock farming around the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the last decade of my career however, I have been focusing much more on experience design - and engaging people and communities away from technology. I have been studying how to engage people and draw them into a community or conversation - curating every detail across multiple touchpoints including what people see, hear, smell, taste–and above else–feel.\n\nExperience design is critical to designing digital experiences and innovative new products. But it can also be used to explore better workplace policies, better experiences for employees, and even shape creative career paths.\n\nTogether, we’ll explore how experience designers are able to explore new ways of addressing the problems their people face.

It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. \n\nDespite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. \n\n2024 had much of the world voting for change.

Strict rules posed challenges for both the censors and photographers, and the resulting images are intriguing, to say the least. \n\nThere are now 11 million photographs in the Imperial War Museum’s archive, many with intriguing stories behind them.

That George Washington owned enslaved people who were Muslim? And that a Muslim diplomat broke his Ramadan fast in the White House in 1805? These are some of the facts that Aymann Ismail (staff writer, Slate Magazine) discovers as he explores the role that Muslims played in the imagination of America’s founding generation. Aymann’s journey takes him from George Washington’s Mount Vernon to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello but begins in the Library of Congress. Here he sees two books that symbolize the promise and contradictions of the early Republic; Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’an and an autobiography written by an enslaved African Muslim, Omar Ibn Said, who was brought to the United States during Jefferson’s presidency.  Through these books, Ayman discovers how some Muslims were included in the founders’ vision of religious freedom in the nascent Republic, while other Muslims were denied all their rights, because of their race and legal status. \n\nThe film features interviews with Keith Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress,) Denise A. Spellberg (author of Thomas Jefferson’s Qur’an: Islam and the Founders), and Jeffrey Einboden (author of Jefferson’s Muslim Fugitives: The Lost Story of Enslaved Africans, their Arabic Letters, and an American President). \n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric.

Learn more about Vancouver at findyourrefresh.com. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nMovie magic is what makes our favorite films so good: Actors flawlessly inhabiting the personalities of totally made-up characters, visual effects transforming a green screen to an otherworldly setting, musical scores making us feel every emotion under the sun. But there’s another kind of magic we don’t talk about as much: one physical location masquerading as another. And it happens all the time.\n\nWhen filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn’t as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nThis is especially true for holiday movies — many of which are filmed in Canada. In this video, we talk to a prolific Christmas movie producer — who has worked on films like 2024’s Netflix hit Hot Frosty — about shooting movies in Canada. \n\nCorrection: In a previous version of this video we mistakenly said that Clark Kent's farm in the TV show Smallville was in Kentucky at :58 and 1:13. The Kent family farm was actually in Kansas.

Coming in the wake of a state investigation that found a broad cascade of failures, “Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” investigates critical missteps that day — and in the years prior, as the county and state were repeatedly advised to invest more money in prevention and preparedness, and as experts and residents raised concerns.\n\nThe documentary draws on harrowing footage filmed by those in the path of the inferno and firsthand accounts from survivors, victims’ families and friends, first responders, and local and state authorities. Through these accounts as well as a detailed analysis of over a thousand 911 calls and public records across multiple government agencies, it provides a wrenching, moment-by-moment reconstruction of the fire and its aftermath. \n\nThe film also examines how changes to the climate and landscape have made Maui increasingly vulnerable to fires and raises difficult questions about what led to the fire’s heavy toll.\n\n“Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” is a FRONTLINE production with Mandarin Duck Films LLC.

Through his paintings and thousands of pages of drawings and writings, Leonardo da Vinci explores one of humankind’s most curious and innovative minds.\n\nDirected by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, and David McMahon, written by David McMahon and Sarah Burns, produced by Sarah Burns, David McMahon, Tim McAleer, and Ken Burns, and executive produced by Ken Burns.\n\n#leonardodavinci #leonardo #renaissance #facts #history #kenburns #anatomy #inventions","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/XSwLFErAwjA?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Why animals help each other - Ashley Ward","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWG2f9DwwpY","date":1734451264,"author":"TED-Ed","unread":true,"content":"Dig into the animal kingdom’s capacity for generosity, and find out how cooperation between animals may contribute to their survival.\n\n--\n\nCharles Darwin introduced the notion of “survival of the fittest,” where the fittest animals are those who can survive long enough to produce healthy offspring. The fittest animal can also be the most stealthy, resourceful, or even the most cooperative. So what exactly does cooperation look like in the wild?

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. \n\nBut our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house. \n\nTo  read more about Roman toilets and plumbing, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/ancient-roman-toilets-history/jim-rowley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#ancientrome #plumbing #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9HaCRGeolMc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The World's Most Stunning Natural Phenomena | BBC Earth Science","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipphJHSFYE0","date":1734264050,"author":"BBC Earth Science","unread":true,"content":"From incredible lightning strikes to finding out what creates the biggest waves in the ocean, witness some of the most stunning natural phenomena caught on camera.\n\nBest of Earth Science: http://bit.ly/EarthLabOriginals \nBest of BBC Earth: http://bit.ly/TheBestOfBBCEarthVideos \n\nTaken from 'Spectacular Earth' (2022)\n\nThis is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes.

But the endeavours of Alan Turing, Dilly Knox and their colleagues were so top secret that we are only now beginning to learn how they really lived day-to-day in this magnificent house, where – behind closed doors, under the cover of darkness, and against the clock - they determined the course of our wartime history. \n\nThe house is also fascinating for what it tells us about how the 10,000 men and women working there would live on a daily basis. Artefacts from a Recreation Club – offering activities such as fencing, debating societies and amateur dramatics, amongst others – and film showings suggest an atmosphere not dissimilar to an Oxbridge college, and show a more human side to the story of how they developed the Enigma Machine. In this World War Two Season Special, join Dan Snow on an exclusive tour of the house and grounds, as well as the little known but all-important cottages that surround them. Learn about the men and women whose skill and ingenuity saved millions of lives, and about the machine they developed to help them do it.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​\n\nThere were 656 mass shootings in the United States in 2023. The one in October in Lewiston, Maine — where an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 — was the year’s deadliest. \nIn “Breakdown in Maine,” FRONTLINE and its Local Journalism Initiative partners the Portland Press Herald and Maine Public examine a series of missteps by the military, local law enforcement and mental health providers before the tragedy. The documentary probes Maine’s unique gun laws and details the shooter’s brain injuries, possibly sustained during his time as an Army grenade instructor. It also examines the devastating impact of the shooting, including on Maine’s Deaf community, which lost four people that day.\n\n“Whose fault is it? Who do we blame?” asks Megan Vozzella, whose husband, Steve, was killed in the shooting. “It makes me angry. He could have been stopped.”\n\nBreakdown in Maine is a FRONTLINE production with Storyboard Studios LLC.  The director is Bronwyn Berry. The producer is James Blue. The writers are Bronwyn Berry and James Blue. The journalists from the Portland Press Herald are Julia Arenstam and John Terhune; and from Maine Public, Steve Mistler and Susan Sharon.

In a fascinating blend of politics and biology, Hitler's Jurassic Park is the true and astonishing story of how the Nazis tried to take control of nature and change the course of evolution.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

So let's see how our video has held up.Re-watch our 2014 video here: https://kgs.link/war-2014\n\n\nOUR CHANNELS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nGerman:        https://kgs.link/youtubeDE\nSpanish:        https://kgs.link/youtubeES\nFrench:          https://kgs.link/youtubeFR\nPortuguese:  https://kgs.link/youtubePT\nArabic:           https://kgs.link/youtubeAR\nHindi:             https://kgs.link/youtubeHI\nJapanese:     https://kgs.link/youtubeJA\nKorean:          https://kgs.link/youtubeKO\n\n\nHOW CAN YOU SUPPORT US?\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThis is how we make our living and it would be a pleasure if you support us!\n\nGet Products designed with ❤️ https://shop.kgs.link\nJoin the Patreon Bird Army 🐧  https://kgs.link/patreon  \n\n\nDISCUSSIONS & SOCIAL MEDIA\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nTikTok:           https://kgs.link/tiktok\nReddit:            https://kgs.link/reddit\nInstagram:     https://kgs.link/instagram\nTwitter:           https://kgs.link/twitter\nFacebook:      https://kgs.link/facebook\nDiscord:          https://kgs.link/discord\nNewsletter:    https://kgs.link/newsletter\n\n\nOUR VOICE\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nThe kurzgesagt voice is from \nSteve Taylor:  https://kgs.link/youtube-voice\n\n\nOUR MUSIC ♬♪\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n700+ minutes of kurzgesagt soundtracks by Epic Mountain:\n\nSpotify:            https://kgs.link/music-spotify\nSoundcloud:   https://kgs.link/music-soundcloud\nBandcamp:     https://kgs.link/music-bandcamp\nYoutube:          https://kgs.link/music-youtube\nFacebook:       https://kgs.link/music-facebook\n\nThe soundtrack of this video:\nSoundcloud: https://bit.ly/4it7IPC\nBandcamp: https://bit.ly/49tUi1G\n\nIf you want to help us caption this video, please send subtitles to subtitle@kurzgesagt.org\nYou can find info on what subtitle files work on YouTube here:\nhttps://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734698?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7296214\nThank you!\n\n\n🐦🐧🐤 PATREON BIRD ARMY 🐤🐧🐦\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\nMany thanks to our wonderful Patreons (from http://kgs.link/patreon) who support us every month and made this video possible:\nJulie C, Matt Towner, Ryan BrodeFrank, Joseph Lee, Billy Cheesesteaks, Damian Rooney, Erwan Le Cren, David Hughes, Ethan Suh, Cameron Ensel, Gustavo Rosanova, Alexandra Andreas, KooParan, Wilson, ManlioRN, Names Haillay,David Dunlap, Marissa Alyse Wilkinson, Craig, Marvela, Jim Wright, Oskar Junevicius, Sai, Magdalena Wanzenböck, Marco Manna, Joe Ward, Anthony Devine, Cameron Mitchell, Matthew Carey, bybr3nnan, Bauer, Erin Lee, Carol Wise, The Towne Witch, Sandy, Stark, Matt Seif, Nomnom, Jenny Griffiths, Toyas Dhake, ChromaDim, Michael Marino, Maxim Dupéré, Tiffany Tang, Marcel Schulz, Super Space Man 34, Huntman473, Mischa Hall, Orange, Jindřich Vlášek\n\n\nCHAPTERS\n▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀\n0:00 Start\n7:27 The End of the Rules Based World?\n9:30 Ground News Sponsorship\n11:22 A Special Piece of kurzgesagt","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/reSfF60-2S4?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Historian Answers Google's Most Popular Questions About Pompeii","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBFAFDwSZls","date":1733767239,"author":"History Hit","unread":true,"content":"Was Pompeii named after Pompey?

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOne thing is clear: The roughly 75 million people who voted for Trump were saying “no” to lots of things.\n\nBut what were they saying “yes” to?\n\nIn this excerpt from The Gray Area podcast, Sean Illing and Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp try to figure out whether Trumpism is a movement or just a moment. Is it a political ideology that we’ll reckon with for years to come, or just a collection of whims from the most powerful man in the world? And what does it mean for the country’s political future?\n\nBeauchamp is the author of The Reactionary Spirit: How America's Most Insidious Political Tradition Swept the World. It’s a book about democracy and the contradictions and conflicts at the heart of it. https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/?lens=publicaffairs \n\nListen to the full conversation.
