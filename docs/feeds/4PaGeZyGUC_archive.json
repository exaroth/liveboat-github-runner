At the heart of the film is Ariella, a brilliant young Muslim scholar whose life is upended by the tragic loss of her father. Shattered but determined, she embarks on a bold journey to uncover answers to life's most profound questions: What is love? Can it endure across time and adversity? And how do we rebuild after losing it? Along the way, Ariella is captivated by five astonishing tales from the Islamic tradition ‚Äî stories that redefine love's meaning.\n\nShe delves into an epic poem of star-crossed love as tragic as Romeo and Juliet and unravels the mysteries of the Taj Mahal. She discovers a largely unknown story about how family love shaped Malcolm X and finds empowerment in the remarkable partnership of the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija. Woven through these rich narratives is Ariella‚Äôs own quest to rediscover faith, hope, and the courage to love again. With breathtaking storytelling and universal resonance, Islam‚Äôs Greatest Stories of Love invites viewers on a journey as unforgettable as the stories it unveils, reminding us that love is not just an emotion; it is a force.</article>","contentLength":2008,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/QBBjiDKMI6A?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Andrew Goes to Hobo Convention","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ql9CTlGqmLA","date":1755903694,"author":"Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan","guid":433,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ql9CTlGqmLA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Gaza‚Äôs hunger crisis is officially a famine #shorts","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6DVbgHcklOs","date":1755897287,"author":"Vox","guid":48,"unread":true,"content":"<article>The UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system ‚Äî the world‚Äôs leading authority on hunger crises ‚Äî has officially determined that there is a famine in Gaza.

A shy, reserved child turned rebellious visionary. He scandalised Vienna with raw, often unsettling depictions of the human body. His work is filled with twisted forms and existential angst, reflecting an obsession with mortality, sexuality, and identity - especially his own. \nHis self-portraits are unlike anything that came before them: emaciated, contorted and confrontational. With sunken eyes and twisted limbs - they were not intended to flatter, but to disturb.

He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality‚Äîa method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting \"residues\" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.\n\nUnlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.\n\nO'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBarry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ Residues\n (https://leanpub.com/residuality) Barry O'Reilly ‚Ä¢ The Architect's Paradox\n (https://leanpub.com/architectsparadox) Jacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patterns\n (https://amzn.to/3E37lvv) Anne Currie &amp; Jamie Dobson ‚Ä¢ The Cloud Native Attitude\n (https://amzn.to/3R0exeT) Gregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ The Software Architect Elevator\n (https://amzn.to/3F6d2ax) Gregor Hohpe ‚Ä¢ Enterprise Integration Patterns, Vol 2 (https://amzn.to/3TNedQ3) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Laughter is both contagious and a social behavior: people laugh 30 times more often in company. The documentary shows how neuroscience and psychology have discovered that humor makes us stronger.\n\nIn London, neuroscientist Sophie Scott has dedicated herself to researching laughter. \"Laughter plays an important role in building and maintaining social relationships. It reduces stress and relaxes us. It is an important behavior to understand,\" she says.  This is why laughter is also interesting for psychology. A research team at the Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt is exploring how humor can help in psychotherapy. Humor strengthens the relationship between therapists and patients, which can actually reduce symptoms.\n\nOthers have also discovered the positive interpersonal effect for themselves: the \"Humor hilft heilen\" (\"humor helps to heal‚Äù) foundation, founded by German doctor and TV presenter Eckart von Hirschhausen, conducts workshops in hospitals, among other places. Humor trainers teach nursing staff how to cope better with the everyday demands of their jobs. It's not about constantly cracking jokes. Rather, it‚Äôs about lightening interactions between nursing staff and patients.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #laughter #laughing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The conflict between Rudolph and Ottokar had been building for five years, representing a final showdown between two powerful rulers who could not coexist. Rudolph's victory marked a turning point in European power dynamics, establishing the Habsburgs as a dominant dynasty with lasting political impact, particularly in Central Europe.

Many of them are now discovering that their past is a lie. International adoptions are at the center of an unprecedented scandal.\n\nThis scandal is far-reaching. It involves children stolen from their mothers during the Pinochet dictatorship, as well as people described as Africa's \"fake orphans‚Äù. The film follows investigative journalists, activists and researchers in South Korea, Sweden, France, Chile, Germany and Switzerland. How was this huge, lucrative market able to flourish? And why does it still exist today?\n\nEven today, women are manipulated, threatened or deceived into giving up their babies - often with the blessing of state authorities. The fraudulent practices persist despite the Hague Convention, which has governed international adoption since 1993. That is because the system is flawed and encourages corruption.\n\nIn many cases, these practices come to light mainly due to pressure from adopted children who have grown into adults. After discovering the dubious conditions of their adoptions, they begin to search for their birth parents and demand explanations. These searches are often easier to conduct these days, thanks to social media, the Internet and the availability of genealogy websites.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #adoption #orphans \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

What is the Casimir Force, and why does empty space press metal plates together? If you crunched the asteroid belt into one object, would it even be a planet?

Surfing was on the verge of extinction almost a century ago - a thorn in the side of Christian missionaries.\n\nIt owes its resurrection to a handful of young runaways, businessmen and rebellious young men and women from all over the world.

What is‚Ä¶ complexity? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O‚ÄôReilly learn how complexity science, chaos theory, and emergence could be the key to understanding our place in the universe with David Krakauer, president of the Santa Fe Institute and professor in complex systems. \n\nIf chemistry is universal, could music be? We dive into what makes something ‚Äúuniversal,‚Äù why Mars is inhabited by robots, and how cities, economies, and societies exhibit emergent behaviors. We explore the roots of complexity science, from steam engines to organisms, and how early thinkers laid the groundwork for studying order in chaos. \n\nWhat does it mean to call something ‚Äúemergent‚Äù? We break down the definition of emergence, chaos theory, and its relationship to math, physics, biology, economics, and psychology. We discuss humans as individual particles and when the unpredictable becomes predictable. How do we get order out of disorder? We break down how intelligence isn‚Äôt just about answers, it‚Äôs about understanding. We examine AI, fake knowledge vs. real problem-solving, and whether life itself is a computational process.\n\nCan consciousness be measured? Are we intelligent, or just clever tools using even cleverer tools? We break down how problem-solving matter transcends what it‚Äôs made of. Where does creativity come from?

In the opening hours, coalition aircraft struck Iraq‚Äôs air defense systems and command networks, crippling its ability to respond.\n\nAt the time, the Iraqi Air Force was the sixth largest in the world. But within days, it was overwhelmed. Many Iraqi jets were lost in the early hours of combat, and hundreds more were destroyed on the ground. Facing near-total air superiority by the coalition, Saddam Hussein ordered a mass evacuation of Iraqi aircraft to neighboring Iran, hoping to preserve them for the future.\n\nTo block escape routes, the U.S. Air Force deployed F-15 Eagles on patrol along the Iranian border, trapping Saddam's Air Force inside the country. In response, Iraq launched an ambitious counter-operation: ‚ÄúOperation Samurra‚Äù. The plan set the stage for a rare head-to-head clash between two Cold War icons‚Äîthe MiG-25 Foxbat and the F-15 Eagle.\n\nThe F-15 Eagle, built by the United States, was a cutting-edge fighter designed with state-of-the-art  avionics, radar systems, and precision weapons. It represented the peak of Western air superiority doctrine. The MiG-25 Foxbat on the other hand was an interceptor built by the Soviet Union. By the 1990s, it was hopelessly outdated but still incredibly fast and dangerous in the right hands. Where the Eagle was refined and sophisticated, the Foxbat was an instrument of brute force.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most surprising aerial encounters of the Gulf War, with an outcome few could have expected.</article>","contentLength":2079,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/5RtwFbSeV5Y?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Unboxing a Iqunix Magi65 keyboard!","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qxaWj2Ab8","date":1755320453,"author":"Chyrosran22","guid":59,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Get it here: https://iqunix.com/products/magi65\nToday we unbox an unusual type of low-profile keyboard, with a few features I've never seen before on one.

Researchers around the world are focusing on bacteriophages. These \"good\" viruses infect specific bacteria and destroy them. Do they offer a way out of the antibiotics crisis?\n\nEvery year, around 1.3 million people die because of antibiotic resistance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this is one of the biggest threats to global health.\n\nThere are various reasons for the growing number of antibiotic resistances: Unspecific or incorrect use of antibiotics causes bacteria to mutate into multi-resistant germs. In addition, the excessive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry has alarming consequences for humans: Antibiotics, which were considered one of medicine's greatest achievements against infections, are increasingly losing their effectiveness. Increasingly, science is relying on the potential of bacteria-eating viruses, or bacteriophages, to combat bacteria.\n\nResearchers from the US, Georgia, Kenya and Uganda are developing suitable phage therapies and establishing international collaborations. And they‚Äôre finding what they‚Äôre looking for in bacteria-contaminated wastewater. Phage samples from the US and African countries will help to build up a biobank and produce specific phage cocktails. Phage therapy has not yet been approved in Germany due to a lack of clinical studies. However, in some countries, such as Georgia and Slovakia, bacteriophages are being used successfully to treat patients with antibiotic resistances.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #health #science \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.\n\nThe duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation. Vlad also reveals his unique approach to the book‚Äîintegrating AI-generated poetry into each chapter to help readers grasp complex concepts. With a focus on modularity as the antidote to complexity, Vlad emphasizes that by managing coupling, engineers can create more maintainable, scalable systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nVlad Khononov ‚Ä¢ Balancing Coupling in Software Design\n (https://amzn.to/4iGpbDv) Vlad Khononov ‚Ä¢ Learning Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/41EVhIX) Sheen Brisals &amp; Luke Hedger ‚Ä¢ Serverless Development on AWS\n (https://amzn.to/3W3Sw2f) Glenford Myers ‚Ä¢ Composite/Structured Design\n (https://amzn.to/4kVblPN) Vaughn Vernon ‚Ä¢ Implementing Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/41Mpk2E) Eric Evans ‚Ä¢ Domain-Driven Design\n (https://amzn.to/43lNxhv) van Kelle, Verschatse &amp; Baas-Schwegler ‚Ä¢ Collaborative Software Design\n (https://amzn.to/4iv0N8I) Nick Tune &amp; Jean-Georges Perrin ‚Ä¢ Architecture Moderniza (https://amzn.to/4b5ASiN) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Weinberg was foundational in establishing the standard model of particle physics, and represented an enormous leap in understanding how this universe works. But his little 1987 paper, though more obscure, may tell us something about how the multiverse works, and can even be thought of as evidence for the existence of an enormous number of other universes. \n\n\nPBS Member Stations rely on viewers like you.

She analyses the historical accuracy of key scenes, from Henry's first meeting with Catherine of Aragon to the downfall of Anne Boleyn and the controversial marriage to Katherine Howard.\n\nThroughout the video, Dr. Paul critiques the casting choices of actors like Damian Lewis, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman, discussing how they capture the complex and often terrifying personality of the Tudor king. She delves into the realities behind the dramatic events, including the annulment from Catherine of Aragon, the secret marriage to Anne Boleyn, the birth of his long-awaited son with Jane Seymour, the disastrous union with Anne of Cleves, and the tragic fate of Katherine Howard, culminating in a look at his final years with Katherine Parr.\n\n0:00 The Young Henry VIII &amp; Catherine of Aragon ('The Spanish Princess')\n12:24 The Anne Boleyn Affair ('The Other Boleyn Girl')\n27:18 A Son &amp; A New Wife: Jane Seymour &amp; Anne of Cleves ('Wolf Hall')\n42:54 The Teenage Queen: Katherine Howard ('The Tudors')\n54:11 Jude Law &amp; The Final Years with Katherine Parr ('Firebrand')\n1:08:16 Historian's Final Verdict on Henry VIII Portrayals\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

They circumnavigate an area that - though roughly the size of China and the USA combined - has only half the population of Berlin.\n\nOn the Chatham Islands, we learn how loneliness becomes a daily challenge when you live surrounded by so much water. A supply ship fails to arrive on time, leading to food prices rising quickly and diesel becoming scarce. But there is a treasure that is harvested in this remote region - something prized by gourmets that fetches high prices: abalone. Jade Kahukore-Dixon dives for these precious sea snails, gathering them at depths of 10 to 15 meters. \"On a good day, I can earn around 2,000 to 2,500 New Zealand dollars,\" he says. But the job is dangerous. This is great white shark territory. Divers are regularly injured or even killed. What some see as a treasure, others view as a burden.\n\nOver on the Marshall Islands, we find the area where the United States tested atomic and hydrogen bombs until the 1960s. The people of these remote atolls are still living with the consequences. On Runit Island lies one of the world‚Äôs largest nuclear waste sites - the structural integrity of which is now under threat because of rising sea levels and tropical storms.\nOn Tuvalu, the team discovers that not all the bleak prophecies may withstand closer scrutiny.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Jade Kahukore-Dixon, the 24-year-old diver on the Chatham Islands whom the team accompanied during his work. Jade Kahukore-Dixon was killed by a great white shark two months after filming ended.\n\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/ENFm1mkgdRY\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

You'll learn some of the core mathematical theory behind why and how this works, as well as the differences between approaches like homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. At the end, you'll get some pointers and open-source library hints on where to go next and how to start using encrypted computation for problems you are solving the hard way (or not solving at all).

Please subscribe to their channel for more: https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles.\n\nKing Baldwin IV, known as the \"Leper King,\" ascended to the throne of Jerusalem at age 13 in 1174, a reign complicated by his diagnosis of leprosy. Despite his debilitating illness, he proved to be a formidable military leader, most notably securing a major victory against Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard in 1177. His reign was a constant struggle with both his worsening health and the political intrigues of his court, which was focused on finding a successor since he could not have children. Baldwin's death at age 23 in 1185 set off a chain of events, including the brief reign of his nephew, the succession of his sister Sibylla and her husband Guy of Lusignan, and ultimately, the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. His short but impactful rule is remembered for his resilience in the face of immense physical and political challenges, which, had he lived longer, might have prevented the eventual collapse of the Crusader kingdom.\n\nDo you love uncovering the past, exploring historic sites, and venturing to distant lands?

However, hundreds of matches from the German top and regional leagues are offered on international betting portals: It's a billion-dollar business.\n\nThe betting industry is cashing in on amateur soccer - even though sports betting on these games is banned in Germany. Clubs and players are often unaware of this and are left empty-handed in this global business. And that's not all: amateur soccer is susceptible to match fixing - the integrity of Germans' favorite sport is at stake!\n\nMany players and clubs have no idea what‚Äôs going on. For example, Kirchheimer SC, a club that played in the Bayernliga in the 23/24 season. They only found out from journalists that bookmakers were making money from their games - and were outraged. The players are amateurs and not in it for the money: \"It's the passion that should count, the fight on the pitch and simply the fun of the sport. I think action should be taken against this,\" says a young amateur player.\n\nBut it's not that simple. Where‚Äôs the loophole in the system? How does information about free kicks, yellow cards and goals in real time in the fifth division get onto bookmakers' websites? The suspicion: there must be someone on the ground collecting and forwarding the data, a person known as a data scout.\n\nThe risk of addiction is particularly high with this kind of betting, as is the temptation to rig the results. In the film, an Austrian amateur gambler who was jailed for match fixing explains how it works. It's not just minor providers including amateur games in their betting portfolio. This is a problem that reaches into the upper echelons of the industry, sponsors of the 2024 European Championship, Bundesliga clubs and even sponsors of the DFB. How can that be?\n\nA team of investigative journalists and data experts uncovers the truth.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

John explains the rebranding and how public interpretation shaped the language. They begin with John‚Äôs background in electrical engineering, quantum optics, and a ‚Äúlove-hate‚Äù relationship with the NSA. They break down how anomalies are detected, from doorbell cameras to advanced electromagnetic sensors, and the challenge of relying on low-quality footage and human observation. Can machine learning and better cameras help? Will there be an app for citizen reporting?\n\nThey explore the data pipeline: how AARO collects, verifies, and investigates reports, including the role of AI-generated fakes, confirmation bias, and false positives like Venus over Brooklyn. With 98% of cases explained and 2% still mysterious, Kosloski shares insights on working with law enforcement, geographic bias, sensor kits, and what defines a ‚Äúhot spot.‚Äù\n\nWhat makes something ‚Äúclassified‚Äù? We break down specific sightings like GoFast or the Mount Etna Object.

Marit van Dijk &amp; Hannes Lowette highlight that while developers are trained to write code, they spend most of their time understanding existing codebases‚Äîoften with incomplete documentation and evolving complexity.\n\nThey discuss research-backed strategies, such as structured code reading exercises, participation in communities like the Code Reading Club, and leveraging modern IDE tools to navigate and comprehend unfamiliar code. The conversation underscores the importance of empathy in code reviews, writing clear commit messages, and using tests as documentation to improve collaboration and maintainability. By practicing code reading deliberately and utilizing available resources, developers can become more effective and adaptable in their work.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nFelienne Hermans ‚Ä¢ The Programmer's Brain\n (https://amzn.to/3mENbN0) Adrienne Braganza Tacke ‚Ä¢ \"Looks Good to Me\": Constructive Code Reviews\n (https://amzn.to/3E75XrD) Duncan McGregor &amp; Nat Pryce ‚Ä¢ Java to Kotlin (https://amzn.to/4apSjLu) \n (https://amzn.to/40OIDa3) Saleem Siddiqui ‚Ä¢ Learning Test-Driven Development\n (https://amzn.to/35OMb3n) Roy Osherove ‚Ä¢ The Art of Unit Testing\n (https://bit.ly/3obiKNB) Trisha Gee &amp; Helen Scott ‚Ä¢ Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA\n (https://amzn.to/3ZBgnGc) Jacqui Read ‚Ä¢ Communication Patt (https://amzn.to/3E37lvv) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Some have taken to listing their items on platforms like eBay or Depop, but an emerging group of vintage resellers are going a more active and rapid route: livestream selling. These small business owners have learned to pivot multiple times in their careers and live shopping is just a new avenue to help them connect more with their customers.\n\nWe sat down with Chris Honetschlaeger (The Record Parlour), Janelle Adviento (@bleumi on Whatnot), Libby Rodney (The Harris Poll), and Darko Pavic (member of the Forbes Technology Council) to explore how livestream shopping could be the future of thrifting ‚Äî especially for younger audiences ‚Äî and the roadblocks to mass adaptation of this technology. \n\nWatch Vox‚Äôs latest to learn more.\n\nLinks: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/02/03/how-live-shopping-is-changing-the-retail-landscape-across-the-globe/\nhttps://theharrispoll.com/briefs/gen-zs-fascination-with-secondhand-apparel-depop-sees-large-brand-equity-gains-among-younger-consumers-according-to-ad-age-harris-poll-brand-tracker/\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/consumers-care-about-sustainability-and-back-it-up-with-their-wallets\nhttps://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2024/ThredUp_2024_Resale%20Report.pdf\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.\n\nThe book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the \"fighting animals\" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.\n\nFinally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nBen Evans &amp; Jim Gough ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Cloud Native Java\n (https://amzn.to/41nivD9) Ben Evans, Jason Clark &amp; David Flanagan ‚Ä¢ Java in a Nutshell\n (https://amzn.to/43FDoMA) Ben Evans, Martijn Verburg &amp; Jason Clark ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer\n (https://amzn.to/41JMG7N) Ben Evans, Jim Gough &amp; Chris Newland ‚Ä¢ Optimizing Java\n (https://amzn.to/4bNOfGh) Ben Evans &amp; Martijn Verburg ‚Ä¢ The Well-Grounded Java Developer (https://amzn.to/4hs9MWk) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

When you‚Äôre faced with difficult choices it‚Äôs your principles, aligned with your values, that steer your course away from or into the rocks. You can‚Äôt anticipate the seas you‚Äôre going to sail, but good principles will work regardless of how choppy the waters are. And the broad and deep waters of building a successful internal developer platform can be choppier than most, so holding your principles close is essential to not drowning in all that platform engineering promise.\n\nPlatform engineering promises the best application of people, financial and technical resources to support and deliver speed at scale, so the stakes are high and the promise mouth-watering to unsuspecting CTOs. But there‚Äôs ‚Äúmany a slip-twixt-cup-and-lip‚Äù, and it‚Äôs looking likely that the roads in the coming years will be likely peppered with wasted budgets and articles such as ‚ÄúWhy platform engineering doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù. So let‚Äôs get ahead of all that negativity and talk about how it can work in a couple of real-world environments.\n\nIn this talk Russ Miles, Technical Product Owner of the Cloud and On-Premise Infrastructure Platform Products at Clear.Bank, will share some principles he uses to guide the teams responsible for delivering a successful internal developer platform. Using real-world examples and stories, and being very careful of survivor bias, we‚Äôll explore the complex terrain that a platform initiative has to plot a course through. After this talk you‚Äôll take away a toolbox of principles to apply to your own complex, socio-technical working environment. You‚Äôll learn the foundations and principles that can keep your own platform engineering initiatives off the rocks and sailing in the blue waters of ROI.\n\nHow you may ask?\nIt all starts by not feeding the pigeons. Curious? See you at the talk!

Exciting discoveries and fresco-inspired animations tell the story of life in Pompeii AD 79. It also imagines the horrors faced by resident as Vesuvius erupted. Stream now: https://to.pbs.org/3ysvubQ\n\nThe excavation aims to unearth the buildings, their purpose, who lived there, and what happened to them during the eruption. Alongside the present tense story of the dig, the series investigates the timeline of the eruption. From the violent earthquakes that shook the city in the years before the eruption to the day of the disaster, Vesuvius first slowly buries Pompeii and then delivers the killer blows in the form of pyroclastic flows.\n\nAnd, for the first time, pioneering new research finds hard evidence that some Pompeiians escaped the city and survived the eruption. From evidence hidden in Pompeii‚Äôs storeroom of prominent Pompeiians, the investigation discovers inscriptions that date from after the eruption and bear the same name in the area surrounding the destroyed city.</article>","contentLength":1970,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/2_2r_Z6jCgg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Hunter Biden on the Illuminati and Diddy Parties","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/j5rGRdb_dho","date":1754513671,"author":"Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan","guid":422,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/j5rGRdb_dho?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Japan is (Literally) Dying Out","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYA9i0KC0tE","date":1754507340,"author":"ColdFusion","guid":400,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Go to https://ground.news/coldfusion to compare news coverage, spot media bias, and avoid algorithms.

The conversation wraps up with practical advice on identifying real bottlenecks and securing buy-in for a successful cloud native journey.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAnne Currie &amp; Jamie Dobson ‚Ä¢ The Cloud Native Attitude\n (https://amzn.to/3R0exeT) Anne Currie, Sarah Hsu, &amp; Sara Bergman ‚Ä¢ Building Green Software\n (https://amzn.to/3IKopW5) Sarah Wells ‚Ä¢ Enabling Microservice Success\n (https://amzn.to/4aa8xrv) Bill Gates ‚Ä¢ How to Avoid a Climate Disaster\n (https://amzn.to/4iWtvPI) Liz Rice ‚Ä¢ Container Security\n (https://amzn.to/3oU4iJe) Burns, Beda &amp; Hightower ‚Ä¢ Kubernetes: Up &amp; Running\n (https://amzn.to/3sueuuI) Matthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais ‚Ä¢ Team Topologies (http://amzn.to/3sVLyLQ) \n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Since 2019, the U.S. has lost nearly 5,000 movie theater screens. Big chains have struggled financially. Alamo Drafthouse, once independent, was recently acquired by Sony Pictures. And Netflix‚Äôs Ted Sarandos famously claimed that moviegoing is an ‚Äúoutdated concept.‚Äù\n\nBut people still love going to the movies ‚Äî and independent movie theater owners are meeting that passion head-on.\n\nAcross the country, independent cinemas are reimagining what it means to be a theater.

Here‚Äôs why.\n\nFor decades parents and pediatricians have followed the CDC‚Äôs Childhood Immunization Schedule. It‚Äôs a monthly schedule that lays out the age a child should be vaccinated for common infectious diseases. Its main goal is to protect one of our most vulnerable populations: children, especially those under the age of one, and it‚Äôs been wildly successful at doing just that. Diseases like polio or measles that at one time left children paralyzed, brain damaged, or even dead were eliminated in the United States. \n\nIn recent years, more and more parents are choosing to delay or even outright omit parts of this schedule and to be fair‚Ä¶ It IS a very overwhelming thing. Why do young children need so many shots so quickly? \n\nSupport our work.
