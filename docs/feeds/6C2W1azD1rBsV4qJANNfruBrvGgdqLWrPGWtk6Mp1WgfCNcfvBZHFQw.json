You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.</em></p><p><em>Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.</em></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a sports journalist named Maria.</p><p>She had to travel often by flight for work.</p><p>But one day she lost her luggage during a flight, and couldn‚Äôt track it. </p><p>So she was sad and upset.</p><p>She hears about a tracking device, called <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airtag/\">Apple AirTag,</a> from a coworker.</p><p>And bought it immediately, she was dazzled by its simplicity in tracking luggage.</p><p>I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):</p><p>And I‚Äôd love to connect if you‚Äôre also on Bluesky:</p><p>An AirTag contains a low-power CPU and a tiny amount of memory.</p><p>A tracking device must send its accurate location data at regular intervals.</p><p>Yet finding location data using GPS, WiFI, or cellular networks consumes power. Besides it‚Äôs expensive to maintain a tracking device with GPS functionality.</p><p>So smart engineers at Apple used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.</p><p>An AirTag doesn‚Äôt use GPS, WiFi, or a cellular network for communication; instead, it uses Bluetooth Low Energy ().</p><p>Imagine BLE as a low-power wireless technology for communication.</p><p>The key pair is shared between AirTag and the user account. The AirTag sends location data after <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-encryption?hl=en\">encrypting</a> it using the public key. While the user account decrypts the received location data using the private key.</p><p>Think of the  as an email address; anyone can send messages to it. While the  is similar to the password of an inbox; only the user with the password can read emails.</p><p>And authenticity of an email can be verified by checking the sender‚Äôs email address: .</p><h3>2. Broadcasting AirTag‚Äôs Location</h3><p>They send the AirTag‚Äôs location, which is near its owner‚Äôs iPhone, using Bluetooth, or Ultra Wideband for precision and efficiency.</p><p>Think of  as a wireless technology for high-speed, and short-range communication.</p><p>Yet Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband communication won‚Äôt work if the owner‚Äôs iPhone is far from the AirTag. So they rely on someone else's iPhone which is nearby.</p><ul><li><p>The AirTag <em>broadcasts its public key every 2 seconds over BLE</em>.</p></li><li><p>Someone else‚Äôs iPhone, which is nearby, receives the broadcast signal. </p></li><li><p>The iPhone encrypts its location data and timestamp using the received public key.</p></li><li><p>The iPhone uploads the encrypted data to the Apple server over HTTP.</p></li></ul><p>Put simply, AirTag doesn‚Äôt send location data; instead, only the public key. The iPhone then includes its location data and encrypts it.</p><h3>3. Finding AirTag‚Äôs Location</h3><p>The owner can find AirTag‚Äôs location using their iPhone app.</p><ul><li><p>The owner authenticates on the Apple server.</p></li><li><p>The owner requests location data for a specific public key.</p></li><li><p>The owner <em>decrypts the received location data using their private key</em>.</p></li></ul><p>The iPhone then displays AirTag‚Äôs recent location on a map.</p><p>An iPhone is necessary to relay location data, so an AirTag won‚Äôt work if there aren‚Äôt any iPhones nearby.</p><p>Put simply, the precision and effectiveness of an AirTag depends on the number of iPhones in its proximity.</p><p>While there are around 1.46 billion iPhone users in the world.</p><p>üëã PS - Do you want to level up at work?</p><ul><li><p>I‚Äôm launching system design deep dives in February 2025.</p></li><li><p>But it‚Äôll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.</p></li></ul><p>My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.</em></p><p><em>Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.</em></p><p>Once upon a time, 3 people decided to sell snowboarding equipment online.</p><p>And set up an e-commerce platform.</p><p>Yet their business model failed.</p><p>So they pivoted to create a software-as-a-service model with the e-commerce platform and called it Shopify.</p><p>Their growth rate was explosive.</p><p>But they wanted to keep it simple and reduce costs.</p><p>So they built Shopify using a classic monolith architecture in Ruby on Rails.</p><p>As time passed, they added features to scale the business.</p><p>Yet it increased the codebase complexity.</p><p>And became difficult to understand &amp; maintain the code.</p><p>So they  moving to a microservices architecture.</p><p>Although it‚Äôll temporarily solve their issues, it might create newer problems.</p><p>Each microservice needs a separate deployment pipeline.</p><p>So it‚Äôll increase the effort and costs.</p><p>Also security vulnerabilities must be updated in each microservice.</p><p>So it‚Äôll increase the system complexity.</p><p>I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):</p><p>And I‚Äôd love to connect if you‚Äôre on Bluesky:</p><p>They wanted the benefits of monolith and microservices architecture.</p><p>But ditch the problems coming with it.</p><p>So they set up a modular monolith.</p><p>They designed each module around a specific business domain.</p><p>Think of as grouping functionalities from a business area within a module. Put simply, related functionalities get stored in a specific module.</p><p>Also they created a  for each module and hid the internal logic &amp; data behind it. It let them:</p><ul><li><p>Understand the behavior of a module easily.</p></li><li><p>Modify a module without breaking others.</p></li></ul><p>Imagine  as a measure of dependency between 2 modules.</p><p>A module will always depend on something.</p><p>Yet dependencies must be minimized.</p><p>So they merged modules with many dependencies on each other. (It happens when domain boundaries aren‚Äôt set properly.)</p><p>They designed modules to communicate with each other via public API - function calls. And threw errors if anything got accessed outside the public API.</p><p>Each module can be deployed as a separate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)\">process</a> for fault isolation.</p><p>So they deploy every module within the same process.</p><p>They organized code so each module contains a business domain. Put simply, each directory represents a specific business domain. For example, the code for orders and payments modules will be in separate directories.</p><p>Also they set up separate database schemas for each module. And avoided transactions across them to avoid coupling &amp; achieve data isolation.</p><p>A modular monolith is a better way to organize code than a classic monolith. Here are its benefits:</p><ul><li><p>It‚Äôs easier to modify code as the area of code change is limited. (Compared to <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/cs/layered-architecture\">layered architecture</a> in a classic monolith.)</p></li><li><p>Developer productivity is high because the codebase is easier to understand.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>There‚Äôs no network overhead because functional calls are enough. (Compared to microservices.)</p></li><li><p>It‚Äôs easier to deploy because there‚Äôs only a single app.</p></li><li><p>The infrastructure costs are low because there‚Äôs only a single codebase.</p></li></ul><p>Besides a modular monolith makes the transition to microservices easier.</p><p>Each architecture has its tradeoffs:</p><ul><li><p>It‚Äôs difficult to scale only a specific module in a modular monolith, so resources might get wasted.</p></li></ul><p>Also failure impact is high because every module runs in the same process.</p><p>Each architectural pattern solves a specific problem.</p><p>Yet there‚Äôs no silver bullet.</p><p>So the correct solution depends on your needs and scale.</p><p>While Shopify remains one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world.</p><p>And handled 30TB traffic per minute during black friday.</p><p>üëã PS - Are you unhappy at your current job?</p><p>And preparing for system design interviews to get your dream job can be stressful.</p><p>Don't worry, I'm working on content to help you pass the system design interview.
