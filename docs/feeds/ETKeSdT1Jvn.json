For users of screen readers, a missing announcement can mean confusion, distrust, or exclusion—yet the issue often remains invisible to most developers and designers. In this talk, we’ll explore how the absence of spoken feedback impacts accessibility, trust, and user experience, particularly for people navigating dynamic web interfaces. Drawing on real-world examples and practical scenarios, we’ll examine the root causes of “silent failures” (such as missing ARIA live regions, improper roles, stale live-region content) and discuss how seemingly minor markup decisions ripple into major accessibility barriers. Attendees will walk away with a clear framework for diagnosing and remedying these silent gaps: from audit strategies and end-user testing through to implementable code patterns, best practices for dynamic announcements, and how to integrate these into your UI/component library workflow. Whether you’re working in React, Web Components, or template-driven apps, you’ll gain actionable insights to ensure your components announce properly, your users feel heard, and your silent UI becomes truly inclusive.\n\n**Key take-aways:**\n\nWhy missing announcements matter: the user-experience impact beyond visual cues\n\nCommon pitfalls in dynamic content, live regions, and state changes\n\nA developer-friendly approach to audit, test, and fix announcement gaps\n\nHow to bake these practices into your component library or design system (for example, your team’s work with PatternFly and a custom theme)\n\nTips for collaboration between developers, UX designers, and accessibility testers to maintain accessibility as your product evolves\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1959,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/x2KwuVDGG10?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Open Source Community Playbook: What Works, What Doesn’t, and Why- DevConf.IN 2026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAy4mgyX61Q","date":1771423085,"author":"DevConf","guid":610,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Title: The Open Source Community Playbook: What Works, What Doesn’t, and Why\n\nSpeaker(s): Pritesh Kiri\n\n---\nIn this talk, I’ll share a practical playbook for creating and sustaining a healthy open source community, drawn from my experience building projects like LitmusChaos, ToolJet, and ReactPlay.

While ArgoCD excels in managing applications within a single Kubernetes cluster, deploying and managing workloads across a fleet of clusters can introduce complexity. This session introduces the ArgoCD Agent, a powerful component designed to simplify and secure multi-cluster GitOps workflows. Modern enterprises run multiple clusters to balance compliance, resilience, and team autonomy across global operations. Attendees will learn what the ArgoCD Agent is, how it addresses challenges in a distributed environment, why it was developed, how it solves the scaling problem and see a live demonstration of it in action.

The core challenges remain the same—managing communication, balancing load, and coordinating resources but the abstractions and tooling are now defined by PyTorch Distributed.\n\nThis talk bridges the gap between traditional HPC paradigms and PyTorch's distributed computing ecosystem, designed specifically for deep learning workloads. We'll explore how familiar HPC concepts like collective operations, point-to-point communication, and process groups, manifest in PyTorch's distributed APIs. We'll discover how PyTorch builds upon battle-tested communication backends (NCCL, Gloo, MPI) while introducing novel primitives optimized for gradient synchronization and model parallelism. We then move beyond basic data parallelism to explore advanced memory-saving techniques like Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), PyTorch's native answer to memory scaling and touch upon the nascent Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism APIs, demonstrating how these techniques compose to train massive models.\n\nThis session equips you with a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch's distributed architecture and reveals the inner workings of one of the most actively developed areas in modern ML infrastructure. By mapping distributed systems concepts to PyTorch's implementation, you'll see how familiar patterns from parallel computing manifest in PyTorch's ecosystem and where there is still room for innovation and improvement.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1798,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/rzJSJsglFYY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to attack AI systems (and how to defend them) !!!! - DevConf.IN 2026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvBiMiIrW3w","date":1771423084,"author":"DevConf","guid":607,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Title: How to attack AI systems (and how to defend them) !!!!\n\nSpeaker(s): Huzaifa Sidhpurwala\n\n---\n\nAI systems today demonstrate impressive capabilities—but they also introduce a rapidly expanding attack surface.

Federated Learning (FL) offers the following two advantages for model update: (1) It aggregates learnings from data patterns of fleet of vehicles to provide a sophisticated model that has been trained on wide range of scenarios. (2) It protects the privacy of the vehicle user without sending raw data to the central repository for model updates. With simulated vehicle data and Flower FL framework, a range prediction solution has been developed in a manner so as to easily port to an embedded edge Texas Instruments platform. The edge component can run as a quality managed (QM) component where as the central model aggregation can run as a containerized application on-prem or cloud where communication is established using gRPC.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1160,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/cl9MUQhaAcY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Beyond ImagePullBackOff: A Stateless, Secret-less Distributed Registry for Edge - DevConf.IN 2026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sYQbqN3dY","date":1771423083,"author":"DevConf","guid":602,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Title: Beyond ImagePullBackOff: A Stateless, Secret-less Distributed Registry for Edge\n\nSpeaker(s): Prasanth Baskar\n\n---\n\nWe have all seen it.
