It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London.

We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. \n\nWe’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.\n\n// Bio\nTomaz Levak, founder of OriginTrail, is active at the intersection of Cryptocurrency, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the core of OriginTrail is a pursuit of Verifiable Internet for AI, an inclusive framework addressing critical challenges of the world in an AI era. To achieve the goal of Verifiable Internet for AI, OriginTrail's trusted knowledge foundation ensures the provenance and verifiability of information while incentivizing the creation of high-quality knowledge. These advancements are pivotal to unlock the full potential of AI as they minimize the technology’s shortfalls such as hallucinations, bias, issues of data ownership, and model collapse.\n\nTomaz's contributions to OriginTrail span over a decade and across multiple fields. He is involved in strategic technical innovations for OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and NeuroWeb blockchain and was among the authors of all three foundational White Paper documents that defined how OriginTrail technology addresses global challenges. Tomaz contributed to the design of OriginTrail token economies and is driving adoption with global brands such as British Standards Institution, Swiss Federal Railways and World Federation of Haemophilia, among others.\n\nCommitted to the ongoing expansion of the OriginTrail ecosystem, Tomaz is a regular speaker at key industry events. In his appearances, he highlights the significant value that the OriginTrail DKG brings to diverse sectors, including supply chains, life sciences, healthcare, and scientific research. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, Tomaz and the OriginTrail ecosystem as a whole are playing an important role in ensuring a more inclusive, transparent and decentralized AI.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://origintrail.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://origintrail.io</a></p>","contentLength":3065,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/97410634/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-0-22%2F393522714-44100-2-c347ea83225bc.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nancey Murphy - A New Heaven & A New Earth?","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk4Snl4NGs8","date":1737734449,"author":"Closer To Truth","guid":496,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Shop Closer To Truth merch like mugs, hoodies, and T-shirts to show your support of the show: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje\n\n‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible.
