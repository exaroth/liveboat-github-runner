We've transformed this process by building a distributed multi-agent system that enables parallel quantitative evaluation of hundreds of product concepts. Our system combines three key components: an Agentic innovation lab generating high-quality product concepts, synthetic consumer panels using fine-tuned foundational models validated against historical data, and an evaluation framework that correlates with real-world testing outcomes. We can talk about how this architecture enables rapid concept discovery and digital experimentation, delivering insights into product success probability before development begins. Through case studies and technical deep-dives, you'll learn how we built an AI powered innovation lab that compresses months of product development and testing into minutes - without sacrificing the accuracy of insights.</p><p>With over 15 years of leadership experience in AI, data science, and analytics, Luca has driven transformative growth in technology-first businesses.

However, these models require significant resources, making them difficult to use in resource-constrained educational settings. This proposal explores how Small Language Models (SLMs) — simpler, open-source and more affordable AI systems — can transform education by offering personalized learning and scalable solutions, even in low-resource environments.\n\nIntroduction:\nSLMs are smaller, simpler versions of AI models that are easier to use and cost less. Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which need powerful computers, SLMs can work on basic devices, making them ideal for schools with limited budgets. They maintain efficiency and accessibility while offering targeted solutions tailored to specific educational needs. By focusing on domain-specific knowledge, local languages, and contextual customization, SLMs address the equity and inclusivity gaps often exacerbated by larger models.\n\nMethodology:\nThis approach leverages insights from recent implementations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in education. Key methodologies include:\n1. Fine-tuning on Localized Data: Customizing SLMs to address specific learner needs and proficiency levels.\n2. Using Lightweight AI Frameworks: Deploying open-source, resource-efficient tools for underserved communities and low-resource settings.\n3. Integrating SLMs into Systems: Adding SLMs to existing learning platforms to create personalized plans and adjust lessons based on students' progress.\n4. Real-World Success Stories: Demonstrating how SLMs enhance teaching through automation, support student progress, and operate efficiently without high-end infrastructure.\n\nDemo Proposal:\nWe will showcase a live demonstration to highlight how Small Language Models (SLMs) can be effectively deployed in real-world educational settings. The demonstration will feature:\nPersonalized Learning Assistant:\nA fine-tuned open-source Small Language Model(SLM) will be used to create personalized learning plans tailored to students' progress and feedback. The key benefits include:\n1. Adaptability to Individual Needs: The system adjusts the complexity of learning materials based on each student’s progress. For slow learners, subjects are presented gradually, with difficulty levels, without overwhelming them. This step-by-step progression builds confidence, enhances engagement, and promotes a deeper understanding of concepts, contributing to their long-term success and mental well-being.\n2. Affordability in Resource-Constrained Settings: SLMs are optimized for low-resource hardware, making them a cost-effective solution for schools and communities with limited budgets.\nThis demo will illustrate how SLMs can empower educators and improve learning outcomes, making quality education accessible to all.\n\nStrengths of SLMs:\nSmall Language Models offer several key advantages for education:\n1. Low Resource Requirements: They run on basic devices like low-cost laptops or mobile phones.\n2. Cost-Effective: Affordable for schools with limited budgets or in developing regions.\n3. Ease of Updates: Easy to adapt to new curricula or local content.\n4. Privacy-Friendly: On-device processing ensures student data security.\n5. Personalization: Tailors learning to individual student needs and paces.\n6. Support for Local Languages: Adaptable to regional languages and cultural contexts.\n7. Energy Efficient: Uses less energy, supporting sustainable AI use.\n8. Scalable: Easy to implement across schools and districts.\n\nLimitations of SLMs:\n1. Less Powerful: SLMs may struggle with complex tasks like handling multi-disciplinary contexts or generating nuanced responses.\n2. Performance Risks: Aggressively scaling down models can lead to degraded accuracy, especially for tasks requiring deep understanding.\n3. Requires Careful Design: Achieving balance between simplicity and performance demands thoughtful optimization and regular evaluation.\n\nReferences\n1.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386358963_Applications_of_Artificial_Intelligence_for_Modern_Businesses_and_Entrepreneurial_Decision_Making_A_Systematic_Review\n2. https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/ANALYSIS_AND_MODELING_OF_STATE-LEVEL_POLICY_AND_LEGISLATIVE_TEXT_WITH_NLP_AND_ML_TECHNIQUES/27956481?file=50976462\n3.  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-46677-9_40\n4.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608023000195\n---\n\nSlides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2025/talk/RZSTYK/</article>","contentLength":4713,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/z-NWvJe8NBw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From Fragmented to Unified:Transforming Management & Governance of Data & AI assets- DevConf.IN 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5NY0f5J79g","date":1744092041,"author":"DevConf","guid":558,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Avinash Singh, Puja Thacker\n\n---\nIn today’s data-driven landscape, organizations in finance and healthcare face the dual challenges of managing sensitive data—such as revenue and patient information—and dealing with data fragmentation across different systems and formats. Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access while ensuring its accessibility for operations is crucial, as is integrating fragmented data for effective governance. This session will explore how the OSS Unity Catalog addresses these issues by centralizing data management, enforcing fine-grained access controls, and ensuring robust governance. Attendees will learn how Unity Catalog’s multimodal interface and support for various data formats and engines enable secure, efficient data sharing across tables, files, functions, and AI models.
