In every enterprise, value emerges from connections: customers to products, suppliers to shipments, molecules to targets. This talk introduces Relational Foundation Models (RFMs)—a new class of models that reason over interactions, not just data points. Drawing on advances in graph neural networks and large-scale ML systems, I’ll show how RFMs capture structure, enable richer reasoning, and deliver measurable business impact.

Previously, Jure served as Chief Scientist at Pinterest and as an investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub.
