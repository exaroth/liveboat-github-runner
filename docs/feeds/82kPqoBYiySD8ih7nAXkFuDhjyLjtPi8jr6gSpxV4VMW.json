In the last\n2 releases, we have concentrated on mitigating a particular source of\nslowness, heap allocations. Each time a Go program allocates memory\nfrom the heap, there’s a fairly large chunk of code that needs to run\nto satisfy that allocation. In addition, heap allocations present\nadditional load on the garbage collector.  Even with recent\nenhancements like <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/greenteagc\">Green Tea</a>, the garbage collector\nstill incurs substantial overhead.</p><p>So we’ve been working on ways to do more allocations on the stack\ninstead of the heap.  Stack allocations are considerably cheaper to\nperform (sometimes completely free).  Moreover, they present no load\nto the garbage collector, as stack allocations can be collected\nautomatically together with the stack frame itself. Stack allocations\nalso enable prompt reuse, which is very cache friendly.</p><h2>Stack allocation of constant-sized slices</h2><p>Consider the task of building a slice of tasks to process:</p><pre><code>func process(c chan task) {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Let’s walk through what happens at runtime when pulling tasks from the\nchannel  and adding them to the slice .</p><p>On the first loop iteration, there is no backing store for , so\n has to allocate one. Because it doesn’t know how big the\nslice will eventually be, it can’t be too aggressive. Currently, it\nallocates a backing store of size 1.</p><p>On the second loop iteration, the backing store now exists, but it is\nfull.  again has to allocate a new backing store, this time of\nsize 2. The old backing store of size 1 is now garbage.</p><p>On the third loop iteration, the backing store of size 2 is\nfull.  has to allocate a new backing store, this time\nof size 4. The old backing store of size 2 is now garbage.</p><p>On the fourth loop iteration, the backing store of size 4 has only 3\nitems in it.  can just place the item in the existing backing\nstore and bump up the slice length. Yay! No call to the allocator for\nthis iteration.</p><p>On the fifth loop iteration, the backing store of size 4 is full, and\n again has to allocate a new backing store, this time of size\n8.</p><p>And so on. We generally double the size of the allocation each time it\nfills up, so we can eventually append most new tasks to the slice\nwithout allocation. But there is a fair amount of overhead in the\n“startup” phase when the slice is small. During this startup phase we\nspend a lot of time in the allocator, and produce a bunch of garbage,\nwhich seems pretty wasteful. And it may be that in your program, the\nslice never really gets large. This startup phase may be all you ever\nencounter.</p><p>If this code was a really hot part of your program, you might be\ntempted to start the slice out at a larger size, to avoid all of these\nallocations.</p><pre><code>func process2(c chan task) {\n    tasks := make([]task, 0, 10) // probably at most 10 tasks\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>This is a reasonable optimization to do. It is never incorrect; your\nprogram still runs correctly. If the guess is too small, you get\nallocations from  as before. If the guess is too large, you\nwaste some memory.</p><p>If your guess for the number of tasks was a good one, then there’s\nonly one allocation site in this program. The  call allocates a\nslice backing store of the correct size, and  never has to do\nany reallocation.</p><p>The surprising thing is that if you benchmark this code with 10\nelements in the channel, you’ll see that you didn’t reduce the number\nof allocations to 1, you reduced the number of allocations to 0!</p><p>The reason is that the compiler decided to allocate the backing store\non the stack. Because it knows what size it needs to be (10 times the\nsize of a task) it can allocate storage for it in the stack frame of\n instead of on the heap<a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/allocation-optimizations#footnotes\"></a>.  Note\nthat this depends on the fact that the backing store does not <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/gc-guide#Escape_analysis\">escape\nto the heap</a> inside of .</p><h2>Stack allocation of variable-sized slices</h2><p>But of course, hard coding a size guess is a bit rigid.\nMaybe we can pass in an estimated length?</p><pre><code>func process3(c chan task, lengthGuess int) {\n    tasks := make([]task, 0, lengthGuess)\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>This lets the caller pick a good size for the  slice, which may\nvary depending on where this code is being called from.</p><p>Unfortunately, in Go 1.24 the non-constant size of the backing store\nmeans the compiler can no longer allocate the backing store on the\nstack.  It will end up on the heap, converting our 0-allocation code\nto 1-allocation code. Still better than having  do all the\nintermediate allocations, but unfortunate.</p><p>But never fear, Go 1.25 is here!</p><p>Imagine you decide to do the following, to get the stack allocation\nonly in cases where the guess is small:</p><pre><code>func process4(c chan task, lengthGuess int) {\n    var tasks []task\n    if lengthGuess &lt;= 10 {\n        tasks = make([]task, 0, 10)\n    } else {\n        tasks = make([]task, 0, lengthGuess)\n    }\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>Kind of ugly, but it would work. When the guess is small, you use a\nconstant size  and thus a stack-allocated backing store, and\nwhen the guess is larger you use a variable size  and allocate\nthe backing store from the heap.</p><p>But in Go 1.25, you don’t need to head down this ugly road. The Go\n1.25 compiler does this transformation for you!  For certain slice\nallocation locations, the compiler automatically allocates a small\n(currently 32-byte) slice backing store, and uses that backing store\nfor the result of the  if the size requested is small\nenough. Otherwise, it uses a heap allocation as normal.</p><p>In Go 1.25,  performs zero heap allocations, if\n is small enough that a slice of that length fits into 32\nbytes. (And of course that  is a correct guess for how\nmany items are in .)</p><p>We’re always improving the performance of Go, so upgrade to the latest\nGo release and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FUm0pfgWehI?si=QRTt_JYwr-cRHDNJ&amp;t=960\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">be\nsurprised</a> by\nhow much faster and memory efficient your program becomes!</p><h2>Stack allocation of append-allocated slices</h2><p>Ok, but you still don’t want to have to change your API to add this\nweird length guess. Anything else you could do?</p><pre><code>func process(c chan task) {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    processAll(tasks)\n}\n</code></pre><p>In Go 1.26, we allocate the same kind of small, speculative backing\nstore on the stack, but now we can use it directly at the \nsite.</p><p>On the first loop iteration, there is no backing store for , so\n uses a small, stack-allocated backing store as the first\nallocation. If, for instance, we can fit 4 s in that backing store,\nthe first  allocates a backing store of length 4 from the stack.</p><p>The next 3 loop iterations append directly to the stack backing store,\nrequiring no allocation.</p><p>On the 4th iteration, the stack backing store is finally full and we\nhave to go to the heap for more backing store. But we have avoided\nalmost all of the startup overhead described earlier in this article.\nNo heap allocations of size, 1, 2, and 4, and none of the garbage that\nthey eventually become. If your slices are small, maybe you will never\nhave a heap allocation.</p><h2>Stack allocation of append-allocated escaping slices</h2><p>Ok, this is all good when the  slice doesn’t escape. But what if\nI’m returning the slice? Then it can’t be allocated on the stack, right?</p><p>Right! The backing store for the slice returned by  below\ncan’t be allocated on the stack, because the stack frame for \ndisappears when  returns.</p><pre><code>func extract(c chan task) []task {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    return tasks\n}\n</code></pre><p>But you might think, the  slice can’t be allocated on the\nstack. But what about all those intermediate slices that just become\ngarbage? Maybe we can allocate those on the stack?</p><pre><code>func extract2(c chan task) []task {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    tasks2 := make([]task, len(tasks))\n    copy(tasks2, tasks)\n    return tasks2\n}\n</code></pre><p>Then the  slice never escapes . It can benefit from\nall of the optimizations described above. Then at the very end of\n, when we know the final size of the slice, we do one heap\nallocation of the required size, copy our s into it, and return\nthe copy.</p><p>But do you really want to write all that additional code? It seems\nerror prone. Maybe the compiler can do this transformation for us?</p><p>For escaping slices, the compiler will transform the original \ncode to something like this:</p><pre><code>func extract3(c chan task) []task {\n    var tasks []task\n    for t := range c {\n        tasks = append(tasks, t)\n    }\n    tasks = runtime.move2heap(tasks)\n    return tasks\n}\n</code></pre><p> is a special compiler+runtime function that is the\nidentity function for slices that are already allocated in the heap.\nFor slices that are on the stack, it allocates a new slice on the\nheap, copies the stack-allocated slice to the heap copy, and returns\nthe heap copy.</p><p>This ensures that for our original  code, if the number of\nitems fits in our small stack-allocated buffer, we perform exactly 1\nallocation of exactly the right size. If the number of items exceeds\nthe capacity our small stack-allocated buffer, we do our normal\ndoubling-allocation once the stack-allocated buffer overflows.</p><p>The optimization that Go 1.26 does is actually better than the\nhand-optimized code, because it does not require the extra\nallocation+copy that the hand-optimized code always does at the end.\nIt requires the allocation+copy only in the case that we’ve exclusively\noperated on a stack-backed slice up to the return point.</p><p>We do pay the cost for a copy, but that cost is almost completely\noffset by the copies in the startup phase that we no longer have to\ndo. (In fact, the new scheme at worst has to copy one more element\nthan the old scheme.)</p><p>Hand optimization can still be beneficial, especially if you have a\ngood estimate of the slice size ahead of time. But hopefully the\ncompiler will now catch a lot of the simple cases for you and allow\nyou to focus on the remaining ones that really matter.</p><p>There are a lot of details that the compiler needs to ensure to get\nall these optimizations right. If you think that one of these\noptimizations is causing correctness or (negative) performance issues\nfor you, you can turn them off with\n<code>-gcflags=all=-d=variablemakehash=n</code>. If turning these optimizations\noff helps, please <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/new\">file an issue</a> so we can investigate.</p><p> Go stacks do not have any -style mechanism for\ndynamically-sized stack frames.

Then in the <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/gofix#go/analysis\">second section</a> we’ll dive into the infrastructure behind it and how it is evolving. Finally, we’ll present the theme of <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/gofix#self-service\">“self-service”</a> analysis tools to help module maintainers and organizations encode their own guidelines and best practices.</p><p>The  command, like  and , accepts a set of patterns that denote packages. This command fixes all packages beneath the current directory:</p><p>On success, it silently updates your source files. It discards any fix that touches <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">generated files</a> since the appropriate fix in that case is to the logic of the generator itself. We recommend running  over your project each time you update your build to a newer Go toolchain release.

Many of the trivial loops that Go programmers routinely write, such as to gather the keys of a map into a slice, can now be conveniently expressed as a call to a generic function such as <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/maps#Keys\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>. Consequently these new features create many opportunities to simplify existing code.</p><p>In December 2024, during the frenzied adoption of LLM coding assistants, we became aware that such tools tended—unsurprisingly—to produce Go code in a style similar to the mass of Go code used during training, even when there were newer, better ways to express the same idea. Less obviously, the same tools often refused to use the newer ways even when directed to do so in general terms such as “always use the latest idioms of Go 1.25.” In some cases, even when explicitly told to use a feature, the model would deny that it existed. (See my 2025 GopherCon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU&amp;t=3m50s\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">talk</a> for more exasperating details.) To ensure that future models are trained on the latest idioms, we need to ensure that these idioms are reflected in the training data, which is to say the global corpus of open-source Go code.</p><p>Over the past year, we have built <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dozens of analyzers</a> to identify opportunities for modernization. Here are three examples of the fixes they suggest:</p><p> replaces an  statement by a use of Go 1.21’s  or  functions:</p><div><pre>x := f()\nif x &lt; 0 {\n    x = 0\n}\nif x &gt; 100 {\n    x = 100\n}\n</pre><pre>x := min(max(f(), 0), 100)\n</pre></div><p> replaces a 3-clause  loop by a Go 1.22 -over-int loop:</p><div><pre>for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {\n    f()\n}\n</pre></div><p> (whose  output we saw earlier) replaces uses of  and slicing by Go 1.18’s :</p><div><pre>i := strings.Index(s, \":\")\nif i &gt;= 0 {\n     return s[:i]\n}\n</pre><pre>before, _, ok := strings.Cut(s, \":\")\nif ok {\n    return before\n}\n</pre></div><p>These modernizers are included in <a href=\"https://go.dev/gopls\">gopls</a>, to provide instant feedback as you type, and in , so that you can modernize several entire packages at once in a single command. In addition to making code clearer, modernizers may help Go programmers learn about newer features. As part of the process of approving each new change to the language and standard library, the <a href=\"https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/README.md\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> review group now considers whether it should be accompanied by a modernizer. We expect to add more modernizers with each release.</p><h2>Example: a modernizer for Go 1.26’s new(expr)</h2><p>Go 1.26 includes a small but widely useful change to the language specification. The built-in  function creates a new variable and returns its address. Historically, its sole argument was required to be a type, such as , and the new variable was initialized to its “zero” value, such as . In Go 1.26, the  function may be called with any value, causing it to create a variable initialized to that value, avoiding the need for an additional statement. For example:</p><div><pre>ptr := new(string)\n*ptr = \"go1.25\"\n</pre></div><p>This feature filled a gap that had been discussed for over a decade and resolved one of the most popular <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/45624\">proposals</a> for a change to the language. It is especially convenient in code that uses a pointer type  to indicate an optional value of type , as is common when working with serialization packages such as <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">json.Marshal</a> or <a href=\"https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/gotutorial/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">protocol buffers</a>. This is such a common pattern that people often capture it in a helper, such as the  function below, saving the caller from the need to break out of an expression context to introduce additional statements:</p><pre><code>type RequestJSON struct {\n    URL      string\n    Attempts *int  // (optional)\n}\n\ndata, err := json.Marshal(&amp;RequestJSON{\n    URL:      url,\n    Attempts: newInt(10),\n})\n\nfunc newInt(x int) *int { return &amp;x }\n</code></pre><p>Helpers such as  are so frequently needed with protocol buffers that the  API itself provides them as <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Int64\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>, <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#String\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a>, and so on. But Go 1.26 makes all these helpers unnecessary:</p><pre><code>data, err := json.Marshal(&amp;RequestJSON{\n    URL:      url,\n    Attempts: new(10),\n})\n</code></pre><p>To help you take advantage of this feature, the  command now includes a fixer, <a href=\"https://tip.golang.org/src/cmd/vendor/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize/newexpr.go\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">newexpr</a>, that recognizes “new-like” functions such as  and suggests fixes to replace the function body with  and to replace every call, whether in the same package or an importing package, with a direct use of .</p><p>To avoid introducing premature uses of new features, modernizers offer fixes only in files that require at least the minimum appropriate version of Go (1.26 in this instance), either through a <a href=\"https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions\"> directive</a> in the enclosing go.mod file or a <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-Build_constraints\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">build constraint</a> in the file itself.</p><p>Run this command to update all calls of this form in your source tree:</p><p>At this point, with luck, all of your -like helper functions will have become unused and may be safely deleted (assuming they aren’t part of a stable published API). A few calls may remain where it would be unsafe to suggest a fix, such as when the name  is locally shadowed by another declaration. You can also use the <a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/deadcode\">deadcode</a> command to help identify unused functions.</p><p>Applying one modernization may create opportunities to apply another. For example, this snippet of code, which clamps  to the range 0–100, causes the minmax modernizer to suggest a fix to use . Once that fix is applied it suggests a second fix, this time to use .</p><div><pre>x := f()\nif x &lt; 0 {\n    x = 0\n}\nif x &gt; 100 {\n    x = 100\n}\n</pre><pre>x := min(max(f(), 0), 100)\n</pre></div><p>Synergies may also occur between different analyzers. For example, a common mistake is to repeatedly concatenate strings within a loop, resulting in quadratic time complexity—a bug and a potential vector for a denial-of-service attack. The  modernizer recognizes the problem and suggests using Go 1.10’s :</p><div><pre>s := \"\"\nfor _, b := range bytes {\n    s += fmt.Sprintf(\"%02x\", b)\n}\nuse(s)\n</pre><pre>var s strings.Builder\nfor _, b := range bytes {\n    s.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(\"%02x\", b))\n}\nuse(s.String())\n</pre></div><p>Once this fix is applied, a second analyzer may recognize that the  and  operations can be combined as <code>fmt.Fprintf(&amp;s, \"%02x\", b)</code>, which is both cleaner and more efficient, and offer a second fix. (This second analyzer is <a href=\"https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks#QF1012\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">QF1012</a> from Dominik Honnef’s <a href=\"https://staticcheck.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">staticcheck</a>, which is already enabled in gopls but not yet in , though we <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/76918\">plan</a> to add staticcheck analyzers to the go command starting in Go 1.27.)</p><p>Consequently, it may be worth running  more than once until it reaches a fixed point; twice is usually enough.</p><h3>Merging fixes and conflicts</h3><p>A single run of  may apply dozens of fixes within the same source file. All fixes are conceptually independent, analogous to a set of git commits with the same parent. The  command uses a simple three-way merge algorithm to reconcile the fixes in sequence, analogous to the task of merging a set of git commits that edit the same file. If a fix conflicts with the list of edits accumulated so far, it is discarded, and the tool issues a warning that some fixes were skipped and that the tool should be run again.</p><p>This reliably detects  conflicts arising from overlapping edits, but another class of conflict is possible: a  conflict occurs when two changes are textually independent but their meanings are incompatible. As an example consider two fixes that each remove the second-to-last use of a local variable: each fix is fine by itself, but when both are applied together the local variable becomes unused, and in Go that’s a compilation error. Neither fix is responsible for removing the variable declaration, but someone has to do it, and that someone is the user of .</p><p>A similar semantic conflict arises when a set of fixes causes an import to become unused. Because this case is so common, the  command applies a final pass to detect unused imports and remove them automatically.</p><p>Semantic conflicts are relatively rare. Fortunately they usually reveal themselves as compilation errors, making them impossible to overlook. Unfortunately, when they happen, they do demand some manual work after running .</p><p>Let’s now delve into the infrastructure beneath these tools.</p><h2>The Go analysis framework</h2><p>Since the earliest days of Go, the  command has had two subcommands for static analysis,  and , each with its own suite of algorithms: “checkers” and “fixers”. A checker reports likely mistakes in your code, such as passing a string instead of an integer as the operand of a  conversion. A fixer safely edits your code to fix a bug or to express the same thing in a better way, perhaps more clearly, concisely, or efficiently. Sometimes the same algorithm appears in both suites when it can both report a mistake and safely fix it.</p><p>In 2017 we redesigned the then-monolithic  program to separate the checker algorithms (now called “analyzers”) from the “driver”, the program that runs them; the result was the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Go analysis framework</a>. This separation enables an analyzer to be written once then run in a diverse range of drivers for different environments, such as:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/unitchecker\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unitchecker</a>, which turns a suite of analyzers into a subcommand that can be run by the go command’s scalable incremental build system, analogous to a compiler in go build.

We often use it for ad hoc experiments and measurements over the module mirror (<a href=\"https://proxy.golang.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proxy.golang.org</a>) corpus.</li><li><a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/multichecker\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">multichecker</a>, which does the same thing for a suite of analyzers with a ‘swiss-army knife’ CLI.</li><li><a href=\"https://go.dev/gopls\">gopls</a>, the <a href=\"https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">language server</a> behind VS Code and other editors, which provides real-time diagnostics from analyzers after each editor keystroke.</li><li>the highly configurable driver used by the <a href=\"https://staticcheck.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">staticcheck</a> tool. (Staticcheck also provides a large suite of analyzers that can be run in other drivers.)</li><li><a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/tricorder-building-a-program-analysis-ecosystem/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tricorder</a>, the batch static analysis pipeline used by Google’s monorepo and integrated with its code review system.</li><li>gopls’ <a href=\"https://go.dev/gopls/features/mcp\">MCP server</a>, which makes diagnostics available to LLM-based coding agents, providing more robust “guardrails”.</li></ul><p>One benefit of the framework is its ability to express helper analyzers that don’t report diagnostics or suggest fixes of their own but instead compute some intermediate data structure that may be useful to many other analyzers, amortizing the costs of its construction. Examples include <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/ctrlflow\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">control-flow graphs</a>, the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/buildssa\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SSA representation</a> of function bodies, and data structures for <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/inspect\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">optimized AST navigation</a>.</p><p>Another benefit of the framework is its support for making deductions across packages. An analyzer can attach a “<a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#hdr-Modular_analysis_with_Facts\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fact</a>” to a function or other symbol so that information learned while analyzing the function’s body can be used when later analyzing a call to the function, even if the call appears in another package or the later analysis occurs in a different process. This makes it easy to define scalable interprocedural analyses. For example, the printf checker can tell when a function such as  is really just a wrapper around , so it knows that calls to  should be checked in a similar manner. This process works by induction, so the tool will also check calls to further wrappers around , and so on. An example of an analyzer that makes heavy use of facts is <a href=\"https://github.com/uber-go/nilaway\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uber’s nilaway</a>, which reports potential mistakes resulting in nil pointer dereferences.</p><img src=\"https://go.dev/blog/gofix-analysis-facts.svg\"><p>The process of “separate analysis” in   is analogous to the process of separate compilation in . Just as the compiler builds packages starting from the bottom of the dependency graph and passing type information up to importing packages, the analysis framework works from the bottom of the dependency graph up, passing facts (and types) up to importing packages.</p><p>In 2019, as we started developing <a href=\"https://go.dev/gopls\">gopls</a>, the language server for Go, we added the ability for an analyzer to suggest a <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#SuggestedFix\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fix</a> when reporting a diagnostic. The printf analyzer, for example, offers to replace  with  to avoid misformatting should the dynamic  value contain a  symbol. This mechanism has become the basis for many of the quick fixes and refactoring features of gopls.</p><p>While all these developments were happening to ,  remained stuck as it was back before the <a href=\"https://go.dev/doc/go1compat\">Go compatibility promise</a>, when early adopters of Go used it to maintain their code during the rapid and sometimes incompatible evolution of the language and libraries.</p><p>The Go 1.26 release brings the Go analysis framework to . The  and  commands have converged and are now almost identical in implementation. The only differences between them are the criteria for the suites of algorithms they use, and what they do with computed diagnostics. Go <a href=\"https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1:src/cmd/vet/main.go;l=62\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vet analyzers</a> must detect likely mistakes with low false positives; their diagnostics are reported to the user. Go <a href=\"https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.26rc1:src/cmd/fix/main.go;l=46\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fix analyzers</a> must generate fixes that are safe to apply without regression in correctness, performance, or style; their diagnostics may not be reported, but the fixes are directly applied. Aside from this difference of emphasis, the task of developing a fixer is no different from that of developing a checker.</p><h3>Improving analysis infrastructure</h3><p>As the number of analyzers in  and  continues to grow, we have been investing in infrastructure both to improve the performance of each analyzer and to make it easier to write each new analyzer.</p><p>For example, most analyzers start by traversing the syntax trees of each file in the package looking for a particular kind of node such as a range statement or function literal. The existing <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inspector</a> package makes this scan efficient by pre-computing a compact index of a complete traversal so that later traversals can quickly skip subtrees that don’t contain any nodes of interest. Recently we extended it with the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/ast/inspector#Cursor\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cursor</a> datatype to allow flexible and efficient navigation between nodes in all four cardinal directions—up, down, left, and right, similar to navigating the elements of an HTML DOM—making it easy and efficient to express a query such as “find each go statement that is the first statement of a loop body”:</p><pre><code>    var curFile inspector.Cursor = ...\n\n    // Find each go statement that is the first statement of a loop body.\n    for curGo := range curFile.Preorder((*ast.GoStmt)(nil)) {\n        kind, index := curGo.ParentEdge()\n        if kind == edge.BlockStmt_List &amp;&amp; index == 0 {\n            switch curGo.Parent().ParentEdgeKind() {\n            case edge.ForStmt_Body, edge.RangeStmt_Body:\n                ...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre><p>Many analyzers start by searching for calls to a specific function, such as . Function calls are among the most numerous expressions in Go code, so rather than search every call expression and test whether it is a call to , it is much more efficient to pre-compute an index of symbol references, which is done by <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/internal/typesinternal/typeindex\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">typeindex</a> and its <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools@v0.41.0/internal/analysis/typeindex\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">helper</a> analyzer. Then the calls to  can be enumerated directly, making the cost proportional to the number of calls instead of to the size of the package. For an analyzer such as <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/hostport\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hostport</a> that seeks an infrequently used symbol (), this can easily make it <a href=\"https://go.dev/cl/657958\">1,000× faster</a>.</p><p>Some other infrastructural improvements over the past year include:</p><ul><li>a <strong>dependency graph of the standard library</strong> that analyzers can consult to avoid introducing import cycles. For example, we can’t introduce a call to  in a package that is itself imported by .</li><li>support for <strong>querying the effective Go version</strong> of a file as determined by the enclosing go.mod file and build tags, so that analyzers don’t insert uses of features that are “too new”.</li><li>a richer <strong>library of refactoring primitives</strong> (e.g. “delete this statement”) that correctly handle adjacent comments and other tricky edge cases.</li></ul><p>We have come a long way, but there remains much to do. Fixer logic can be tricky to get right. Since we expect users to apply hundreds of suggested fixes with only cursory review, it’s critical that fixers are correct even in obscure edge cases. As just one example (see my GopherCon <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU&amp;t=13m17s\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">talk</a> for several more), we built a modernizer that replaces calls such as <code>append([]string{}, slice...)</code> by the clearer  only to discover that, when  is empty, the result of Clone is nil, a subtle behavior change that in rare cases can cause bugs; so we had to exclude <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/modernize#hdr-Analyzer_appendclipped\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that modernizer</a> from the  suite.</p><p>Some of these difficulties for authors of analyzers can be ameliorated with better documentation (both for humans and LLMs), particularly checklists of surprising edge cases to consider and test. A pattern-matching engine for syntax trees, similar to those in <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/honnef.co/go/tools/pattern\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">staticcheck</a> and <a href=\"https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/queries/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tree Sitter</a>, could simplify the fiddly task of efficiently identifying the locations that need fixing. A richer library of operators for computing accurate fixes would help avoid common mistakes. A better test harness would let us check that fixes don’t break the build, and preserve dynamic properties of the target code. These are all on our roadmap.</p><h2>The “self-service” paradigm</h2><p>More fundamentally, we are turning our attention in 2026 to a “self-service” paradigm.</p><p>The  analyzer we saw earlier is a typical modernizer: a bespoke algorithm tailored to a particular feature. The bespoke model works well for features of the language and standard library, but it doesn’t really help update uses of third-party packages. Although there’s nothing to stop you from writing a modernizer for your own public APIs and running it on your own project, there’s no automatic way to get users of your API to run it too. Your modernizer probably wouldn’t belong in gopls or the  suite unless your API is particularly widely used across the Go ecosystem. Even in that case you would have to obtain code reviews and approvals and then wait for the next release.</p><p>Under the self-service paradigm, Go programmers would be able to define modernizations for their own APIs that their users can apply without all the bottlenecks of the current centralized paradigm. This is especially important as the Go community and global Go corpus are growing much faster than the ability of our team to review analyzer contributions.</p><p>The  command in Go 1.26 includes a preview of the first fruits of this new paradigm: the <strong>annotation-driven source-level inliner</strong>, which we’ll describe in an upcoming companion blog post next week. In the coming year, we plan to investigate two more approaches within this paradigm.</p><p>First, we will be exploring the possibility of <a href=\"https://go.dev/issue/59869\">dynamically loading</a> modernizers from the source tree and securely executing them, either in gopls or . In this approach a package that provides an API for, say, a SQL database could additionally provide a checker for misuses of the API, such as SQL injection vulnerabilities or failure to handle critical errors. The same mechanism could be used by project maintainers to encode internal housekeeping rules, such as avoiding calls to certain problematic functions or enforcing stronger coding disciplines in critical parts of the code.</p><p>Second, many existing checkers can be informally described as “don’t forget to X after you Y!”, such as “close the file after you open it”, “cancel the context after you create it”, “unlock the mutex after you lock it”, “break out of the iterator loop after yield returns false”, and so on. What such checkers have in common is that they enforce certain invariants on all execution paths. We plan to explore generalizations and unifications of these control-flow checkers so that Go programmers can easily apply them to new domains, without complex analytical logic, simply by annotating their own code.</p><p>We hope that these new tools will save you effort during maintenance of your Go projects and help you learn about and benefit from newer features sooner.
