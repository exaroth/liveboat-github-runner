He originally wanted to call it \"Freax,\" but his friend Ari Lemmke, who set up the server, named the directory \"Linux\" instead. Early contributor Theodore Ts'o set up the first North American mirror on his VAXstation at MIT, since the sole 64 kbps link between Finland and the US made downloads painful. That mirror gave developers on this side of the Atlantic their first practical access to the kernel. \n\nAnother early developer, Dirk Hohndel, recalled that Torvalds initially threw away incoming patches and reimplemented them from scratch -- a habit he eventually dropped because it did not scale. When Torvalds could not afford to upgrade his underpowered 386, developer H. Peter Anvin collected checks from contributors through his university mailbox and wired the funds to Finland, covering the international banking fees himself. Torvalds got a 486DX/2. In 1992, he moved the kernel to the GPL, and the first full distributions appeared in 1992-1993, turning Linux from a kernel into installable systems.","contentLength":1449,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Idea Raised For Nicer DRM Panic Screen Integration On Fedora Linux","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/26/02/17/2157254/idea-raised-for-nicer-drm-panic-screen-integration-on-fedora-linux?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1771370400,"author":"BeauHD","guid":191,"unread":true,"content":"A proposal within the Fedora Linux community suggests improving the kernel's DRM Panic screen to a more user-friendly, BSOD-style experience.

Besides having a more pleasant UI/UX, from this web page the intent would also be to make it easier to report this error to the Fedora BugZilla. Being able to easily pass the kernel log to the Fedora bug tracker could help in making upstream aware of the problem(s) and seeing if other users are also encountering similar panics.\n \nRight now this idea was just raised earlier today as a \"request for comments\" on the Fedora mailing list.

Yes, the M-series chips are ARM-based, but that doesn't automatically make the whole system compatible in the same way most traditional x86 PCs are. Pretty much everything in modern MacBooks is custom. The boot process isn't standard UEFI like on most PCs. Apple has its own boot chain called iBoot. The same goes for other things, like the GPU, power management, USB controllers, and pretty much every other hardware component. It is as proprietary as it gets. \n\nThis is exactly what the team behind Asahi Linux has been working toward. Their entire goal has been to make Linux properly usable on M-series Macs by building the missing pieces from the ground up. I first tried it back in 2023, when the project was still tied to Arch Linux and decided to give it a try again in 2026. These days, though, the main release is called Fedora Asahi Remix, which, as the name suggests, is built on Fedora rather than Arch... \n\nFor Linux on Apple Silicon, the article lists three major disappointments:\n \n\"External monitors don't work unless your MacBook has a built-in HDMI port.\"\n\"Linux just doesn't feel fully ready for ARM yet. A lot of applications still aren't compiled for ARM, so software support ends up being very hit or miss.\" (And even most of the apps tested with FEX \"either didn't run properly or weren't stable enough to rely on.\")\nAsahi \"refused to connect to my phone's hotspot,\" they write (adding \"No, it wasn't an iPhone\").","contentLength":1703,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Oldest Active Linux Distro Slackware Finally Releases Version 15.0","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/26/02/15/0249259/oldest-active-linux-distro-slackware-finally-releases-version-150?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1771176840,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":189,"unread":true,"content":"Created in 1993, Slackware is considered the oldest Linux distro that's still actively maintained. And more than three decades later... there's a new release! (And there's also a Slackware Live Edition that can run from a DVD or USB stick...)\n.\n \n\nSlackware's latest version was released way back in 2016, notes the blog It's FOSS:\n\n\nThe major highlight of Slackware 15 is the addition of the latest Linux Kernel 5.15 LTS. This is a big jump from Linux Kernel 5.10 LTS that we noticed in the beta release. Interestingly, the Slackware team tested hundreds of Linux Kernel versions before settling on Linux Kernel 5.15.19. The release note mentions... \"We finally ended up on kernel version 5.15.19 after Greg Kroah-Hartman confirmed that it would get long-term support until at least October 2023 (and quite probably for longer than that).\" \n\nIn case you are curious, Linux Kernel 5.15 brings in updates like enhanced NTFS driver support and improvements for Intel/AMD processors and Apple's M1 chip. It also adds initial support for Intel 12th gen processors. Overall, with Linux Kernel 5.15 LTS, you should get a good hardware compatibility result for the oldest active Linux distro. \n\n\nSlackware's announcement says \"The challenge this time around was to adopt as much of the good stuff out there as we could without changing the character of the operating system. Keep it familiar, but make it modern.\"\n\n\nAnd boy did we have our work cut out for us. We adopted privileged access management (PAM) finally, as projects we needed dropped support for pure shadow passwords. We switched from ConsoleKit2 to elogind, making it much easier to support software that targets that Other Init System and bringing us up-to-date with the XDG standards. We added support for PipeWire as an alternate to PulseAudio, and for Wayland sessions in addition to X11. Dropped Qt4 and moved entirely to Qt5. Brought in Rust and Python 3. Added many, many new libraries to the system to help support all the various additions. \n\nWe've upgraded to two of the finest desktop environments available today: Xfce 4.16, a fast and lightweight but visually appealing and easy to use desktop environment, and the KDE Plasma 5 graphical workspaces environment, version 5.23.5 (the Plasma 25th Anniversary Edition). This also supports running under Wayland or X11. We still love Sendmail, but have moved it into the /extra directory and made Postfix the default mail handler. The old imapd and ipop3d have been retired and replaced by the much more featureful Dovecot IMAP and POP3 server.\n \n\n\"As usual, the kernel is provided in two flavors, generic and huge,\" according to the release notes. \"The huge kernel contains enough built-in drivers that in most cases an initrd is not needed to boot the system.\" \n\nIf you'd like to support Slackware, there's an official Patreon account.\nAnd the release announcement ends with this personal note:\n\n\nSadly, we lost a couple of good friends during this development cycle and this release is dedicated to them. Erik \"alphageek\" Jan Tromp passed away in 2020 after a long illness... My old friend Brett Person also passed away in 2020. Without Brett, it's possible that there wouldn't be any Slackware as we know it — he's the one who encouraged me to upload it to FTP back in 1993 and served as Slackware's original beta-tester. He was long considered a co-founder of this project. I knew Brett since the days of the Beggar's Banquet BBS in Fargo back in the 1980's... Gonna miss you too, pal. \n\nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader rastos1 for sharing thre news.","contentLength":3576,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Is Linux Mint Burning Out?
