Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. \n\n In fact, December \"saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey,\" according to TechSpot &mdash; \"up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%...\"\nElsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.\nRounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... \n\nPhoronix adds that the Windows percent \"pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Steam+On+Linux+Ends+2024+With+Small+Marketshare+Boost%2C+AMD+Linux+CPU+Use+Near+74%25%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F05%2F0251206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F01%2F05%2F0251206%2Fsteam-on-linux-ends-2024-with-small-marketshare-boost-amd-linux-cpu-use-near-74%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/05/0251206/steam-on-linux-ends-2024-with-small-marketshare-boost-amd-linux-cpu-use-near-74?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Is 2025 the Year of the Linux Desktop?","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/31/205245/is-2025-the-year-of-the-linux-desktop?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1735676400,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"content":"The long-anticipated \"year of the Linux desktop\" could see renewed interest in 2025 as Microsoft's planned end of support for Windows 10 approaches, potentially driving users to explore alternatives. \n\nWith Windows 10 reaching end of support in October 2025, many users will face decisions about upgrading hardware for Windows 11 or considering different operating systems entirely.

Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Linux+Kernel+6.12+Confirmed+As+LTS%2C+Will+Be+Supported+For+'Multiple+Years'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0125219%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0125219%2Flinux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0125219/linux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
