indie hackers community for years.<p>I had made so many useless apps [you should check my website <a href=\"https://ansh.life\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ansh.life</a>], but this time I built a very useful product that has a number of super easy-to-use tools in one app for video, music, and photo files. Users can compress, convert, resize, and do so much more with easy-to-use tools.<p>Background: I developed a frame-by-frame video cropper to upload cropped landscape videos to Instagram Reels. However, it required FFmpeg, and as a noob video editor, I decided to incorporate more user-friendly video tools. I then introduced image and audio tools to maximize the capabilities of FFmpeg. I use my app daily, and it has surprisingly generated a few thousand dollars for me.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585009\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42585009</a></p>\n<p>Points: 521</p>\n<p># Comments: 290</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”?","url":"https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/","date":1735900244,"author":"rcarmo","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/\">https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584400\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584400</a></p>\n<p>Points: 791</p>\n<p># Comments: 437</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"I am rich and have no idea what to do","url":"https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/","date":1735858215,"author":"vhiremath4","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/\">https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579873\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579873</a></p>\n<p>Points: 934</p>\n<p># Comments: 1595</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"iTerm2 critical security release","url":"https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog","date":1735855722,"author":"tjwds","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog\">https://iterm2.com/downloads/stable/iTerm2-3_5_11.changelog</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579472\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42579472</a></p>\n<p>Points: 666</p>\n<p># Comments: 436</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Tell HN: Impassable Cloudflare challenges are ruining my browsing experience","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577076","date":1735841988,"author":"blakeashleyjr","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>I travel often.
