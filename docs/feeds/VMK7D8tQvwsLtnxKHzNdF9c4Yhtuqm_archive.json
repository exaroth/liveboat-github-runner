by evolution to appear to love you, really does love you.</p></li><li><p>That if you’re a life form and you cook up a baby and copy your genes to them, you’ll find that the genes have been degraded due to oxidative stress et al., which isn’t cause for celebration, but if you find some other hopefully-hot person and randomly swap in half of their genes, your baby will still be somewhat less fit compared to you and your hopefully-hot friend on average, but now there is variance, so if you cook up several babies, one of them might be as fit or even fitter than you, and that one will likely have more babies than your other babies have, and thus complex life can persist in a universe with increasing entropy.</p></li><li><p>That if we wanted to, we surely  figure out which of the 300-ish strains of rhinovirus are circulating in a given area at a given time and rapidly vaccinate people to stop it and thereby finally “cure” the common cold, and though this is too annoying to pursue right now, it seems like it’s just a matter of time.</p></li><li><p>That if you look back at history, you see that plagues went from Europe to the Americas but not the other way, which suggests that urbanization and travel are great allies for infectious disease, and these both continue today but are held in check by sanitation and vaccines even while we have lots of tricks like UVC light and high-frequency sound and air filtration and waste monitoring and paying people to stay home that we’ve barely even put in play.</p></li><li><p>That while engineered infectious diseases loom ever-larger as a potential very big problem, we also have lots of crazier tricks we  pull out like panopticon viral screening or toilet monitors or daily individualized saliva sampling or engineered microbe-resistant surfaces or even dividing society into cells with rotating interlocks or having people walk around in little personal spacesuits, and while admittedly most of this doesn’t sound awesome, I see no reason this shouldn’t be a battle that we would win.</p></li><li><p>That clean water, unlimited, almost free.</p></li><li><p>That radioactive atoms either release a ton of energy but also quickly stop existing—a gram of Rubidium-90 scattered around your kitchen emits as much energy as ~200,000 incandescent lightbulbs but after an hour only 0.000000113g is left—or don’t put out very much energy but keep existing for a long time—a gram of Carbon-14 only puts out the equivalent of 0.0000212 light bulbs but if you start with a gram, you’ll still have 0.999879g after a year—so it isn’t actually  easy to permanently poison the environment with radiation although Cobalt-60 with its medium energy output and medium half-life is unfortunate, medical applications notwithstanding I still wish Cobalt-60 didn’t exist, screw you Cobalt-60.</p></li><li><p>That while curing all cancer would only increase life expectancy by ~3 years and curing all heart disease would only increase life expectancy by ~3 years, and preventing all accidents would only increase life expectancy by ~1.5 years, if we did all of these at the same time and then a lot of other stuff too, eventually the effects would go nonlinear, so trying to cure cancer isn’t actually a waste of time, thankfully.</p></li><li><p>That the peroxisome, while the mitochondria and their stupid Krebs cycle get all the

don’t starve so fast and then layered on some maintenance processes, but the effect is that we live in a cycle and when things aren’t going your way it’s comforting that reality doesn’t stretch out before you indefinitely but instead you can look forward to a reset and a pause that’s somehow neither experienced nor skipped.</p></li><li><p>That, glamorous or not, comfortable or not, cheap or not,

success.</p></li><li><p>That every symbolic expression recursively built from differentiable elementary functions has a derivative that can also be written as a recursive combination of elementary functions, although the latter expression may require vastly more terms.</p></li><li><p>That every expression graph built from differentiable elementary functions and producing a scalar output has a gradient that can itself be written as an expression graph, and furthermore that the latter expression graph is always the same size as the first one and is easy to find, and thus that it’s possible to fit very large expression graphs to data.</p></li><li><p>That, eerily, biological life and biological intelligence does not appear to make use of that property of expression graphs.</p></li><li><p>That if you look at something and move your head around, you observe the entire light field, which is a five-dimensional function of three spatial coordinates and two angles, and yet if you do something fancy with lasers, somehow that entire light field can be stored on a single piece of normal two-dimensional film and then replayed later.</p></li><li><p>That, as far as I can tell, the reason five-dimensional light fields can be stored on two-dimensional film simply cannot be explained without quite a lot of wave mechanics, a vivid example of the strangeness of this place and proof that all those physicists with their diffractions and phase conjugations really are up to something.</p></li><li><p>That disposable plastic, littered or not, harmless when consumed as thousands of small particles or not, is popular for a reason.</p></li><li><p>That disposable plastic, when disposed of correctly, is literally carbon sequestration, and that if/when air-derived plastic replaces dead-plankton-derived plastic, this might be incredibly convenient, although it must be said that currently the carbon in disposable plastic only represents a single-digit percentage of total carbon emissions.</p></li><li><p>That rocks can be broken into pieces and then you can’t un-break the pieces but you can check that they came from the same rock, it’s basically cryptography.</p></li><li><p>That the deal society has made is that if you have kids then everyone you encounter is obligated to chip in a bit to assist you, and this seems to mostly work without the need for constant grimy negotiated transactions as Econ 101 would suggest, although the exact contours of this deal seem to be a bit murky.</p></li><li><p>That of all the humans that have ever lived, the majority lived under some kind of autocracy, with the rest distributed among tribal bands, chiefdoms, failed states, and flawed democracies, and only something like 1% enjoyed free elections and the rule of law and civil liberties and minimal corruption, yet we endured and today that number is closer to 10%, and so if you find yourself outside that set, do not lose heart.</p></li><li><p>That if you were in two dimensions and you tried to eat something then maybe your body would split into two pieces since the whole path from mouth to anus would have to be disconnected, so be thankful you’re in three dimensions, although maybe you could have some kind of jigsaw-shaped digestive tract so your two pieces would only jiggle around or maybe you could use the same orifice for both purposes, remember that if you ever find yourself in two dimensions, I guess.</p></li>","contentLength":8048,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46073033"},{"title":"AI CEO – Replace your boss before they

Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load.</p><p>At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare.</p><p><strong>ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)</strong></p><p>Key Historical Milestones:</p><ul></ul><p>This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects.</p><p><strong>The difference between a TPU and a GPU?</strong></p><p>To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture.</p><p>The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads.</p><p>A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array.</p><p>The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck).</p><p>In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”).</p><ol><li><p>It loads data (weights) once.</p></li><li><p>It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers.</p></li><li><p>The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory.</p></li></ol><p>What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data.</p><p>Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking:</p><ul><li><p>They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs)</p></li><li><p>It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip.</p></li><li><p>Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks.</p></li></ul><p>The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule.</p><p>For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do.</p><p><strong>Performance numbers TPU vs GPU?</strong></p><p>As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways.</p><p>The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data:</p><ul><li><p>TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5p</p></li><li><p>TPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GB</p></li><li><p>TPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5p</p></li></ul><p>We can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7.</p><p>Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA &amp; others), the summary of the results is as follows.</p><p>Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho.</p><p>A Former Google Cloud employee:</p><div><p>»If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome.</p><p>The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.«</p></div><p>Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs:</p><div><p>»TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%«</p></div><p>This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7.</p><p>Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads).</p><p>There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail:</p><div><p>»If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage.</p><p>Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.«</p></div><p>Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs:</p><div><p>»I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.«</p></div><p>We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment:</p><div><p>»When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.«</p></div><p>What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU.</p><p>A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia:</p><div><p>»The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia«</p></div><p>In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium).</p><p>Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely.</p><p>Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs?</p><p><strong>Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUs</strong></p><p>It is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example).</p><p>The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well:</p><div><p>»Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies.</p><p>Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in.</p><p>I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there.</p><p>With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.«</p></div><p>These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible.</p><p>A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization.</p><p><strong>Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 years</strong></p><p>The most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC.</p><p>The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future).</p><p>While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part.</p><p>Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs.</p><p>As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it.

While there were issues concerning conditions such as attribution required by most licenses, there was a particularly high volume of discourse suggesting that the conditions of copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), would propagate to the model itself, necessitating that the entire model be released under the same license. The propagation of the GPL is a concept that many modern software engineers have naturally accepted; thus, for an engineer with a straightforward sensibility, it is a perfectly natural progression to think that if GPL code is included in some form, copyleft applies and the license propagates.</p><p>However, as of 2025, the theory that the license of the source code propagates to AI models trained on Open Source code is not seen as frequently as it was back then. Although some ardent believers in software freedom still advocate for such theories, it appears they are being overwhelmed by the benefits of AI coding, which has overwhelmingly permeated the programming field. Amidst this trend, even I sometimes succumb to the illusion that such a theory never existed in the first place.</p><p>Has the theory that the license of training code propagates to such AI models been completely refuted?</p><p>Actually, it has not. This issue remains an indeterminate problem where lawsuits are still ongoing and the judgments of major national governments have not been made clear. In this article, I will explain the current situation of this license propagation theory, namely “GPL propagates to AI models trained on GPL code,” and connect it to points of discussion such as the legal positioning of models and the nature of the freedom we pursue in the AI domain.</p><p>This article is an English translation of a post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shujisado.com/2025/11/25/gpl_propagation_to_ai_models/\">originally written in Japanese.</a>&nbsp;While it assumes a Japanese reader, I believe it may also be useful for an English-speaking audience.</p><h2>The Current Standing in Two Lawsuits</h2><p>First, let us organize what the “GPL propagation theory to AI models” entails. This is the idea that when an AI model ingests GPL code as training data, the model itself constitutes a derivative work (derivative) of the GPL code; therefore, when distributing the model, the copyleft conditions of the GPL, such as the obligation to disclose source code, apply. In other words, it is not a question of whether the output of the model is similar to the GPL code, but a theory that “since the model itself is a derivative containing GPL code, the GPL extends to the model.” While there were many voices supporting this theory around 2021, as mentioned earlier, it is no longer the mainstream of the discussion today. However, two major ongoing lawsuits can be cited as grounds that this theory has not been completely denied. These are  (the Copilot class action) filed in the United States and  filed in Germany. I will explain the history and current status of each lawsuit below.</p><h3>Doe v. GitHub (Copilot Class Action): The Persisting Claim of Open Source License Violation</h3><p>In the Copilot class action filed at the end of 2022 in relation to GitHub Copilot, anonymous developers became plaintiffs and argued that GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI trained their models on source code from public repositories without permission, inviting massive license violations through Copilot. Specifically, they viewed it as problematic that when Copilot reproduces part of the code that served as the training source in its output, it does not perform the author attribution or copyright notice required by licenses such as MIT or Apache-2.0 at all, and furthermore, it indiscriminately trains on and outputs code under licenses that impose copyleft conditions like the GPL, thereby trampling on license clauses. The plaintiffs claimed this was a contractual violation of open source licenses and also sought damages and injunctions, asserting that it constituted a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) under copyright law.</p><p>In this case, several decisions have already been handed down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and many of the plaintiffs’ claims have been dismissed. What were dismissed were mainly peripheral claims such as DMCA clause violations, privacy policy violations, unjust enrichment, and torts, but some DMCA violations and the claim of “violation of open source licenses” (breach of contract) are still alive. Regarding the latter specifically, the argument is that despite the plaintiffs’ code being published under licenses like GPL or MIT, the defendants failed to comply with the author attribution or the obligation to publish derivatives under the same license, which constitutes a contractual violation. Although the court did not recognize claims for monetary damages because the plaintiffs could not demonstrate a specific amount of damage, it determined that there were sufficient grounds for the claim for injunctive relief against the license violation itself. As a result, the plaintiffs are permitted to continue the lawsuit seeking an order prohibiting the act of Copilot reproducing others’ code without appropriate license indications.</p><p>As is clear from the above history, “violation of open source licenses in training data” is still being contested in court in the Copilot litigation, and this is one of the reasons why the theory of license propagation to models has not been completely denied. The plaintiffs’ claim in this lawsuit does not directly demand the release of the model itself under the GPL, but it legally pursues the point that license conditions were ignored in the process of training and output; consequently, it suggests that “if the handling does not follow the license of the training data, the act of providing the model could be illegal.” Furthermore, the court has not clearly rejected this logic at this stage and has indicated a judgment that the use of open source code is accompanied by license obligations, and providing tools that ignore this could constitute a tort subject to injunction.</p><p>However, it is necessary to note that the claims in the Copilot litigation are legally framed as breach of contract (license) or DMCA violation, and are not a direct copyright argument that “the model is a derivative work of GPL code.” No judgment has been shown stepping so far as to mandate the disclosure of the entire model under the GPL license. The actual judgment is conservative, stating “monetary damages have not been shown, but there is room for future injunctive relief,” and does not mention the obligation to disclose the model itself. In other words, at present, there is no judicial precedent directly addressing the “GPL propagation theory to models,” and the situation is one where the issue raised regarding license violation of the source code remains alive in the judicial arena.</p><h3>GEMA v. OpenAI: The Theory Treating “Memory” in Models as Legal Reproduction</h3><p>Another important lawsuit is the case where the German music copyright collective GEMA sued OpenAI. This is a copyright lawsuit concerning the unauthorized training and output of lyrics by an AI model, not AI code generation, but it carries significant theoretical implications related to “license propagation to models” even if not directly related to GPL.</p><p>In November 2025, the Munich I Regional Court handed down a judgment on this lawsuit, indicating regarding the matter where the ChatGPT model had memorized and reproduced the lyrics of 9 famous German songs, that the act of “memory” inside the model itself falls under the act of reproduction under copyright law. According to the judgment, the lyrics under the plaintiff’s management were “fixed” in the models of ChatGPT’s GPT-4 and 4o, and the situation was such that the lyrics were output almost verbatim just by the user giving a simple prompt. Based on this, the court determined that the model contains “parameters that memorized the work” internally, and if it is possible to reproduce an expression substantially identical to the original work for a human by means of an appropriate prompt, that memory itself falls under “reproduction” in Article 16 of the German Copyright Act. Furthermore, it determined that the act of actually outputting lyrics in response to a prompt is also a separate act of reproduction, and providing lyrics to the user falls under the act of making available to the public (public transmission). Also, it ruled that since all of these are done without the permission of the rights holder, they deviate from the scope justified by the TDM (Text and Data Mining) exception in the EU DSM Copyright Directive.</p><p>The important point of this judgment is that it clearly acknowledged that “if a work is recorded inside the model in a reproducible form, that state itself can constitute copyright infringement.” The court cited the text of the EU InfoSoc Directive that “reproduction includes copies in any form or manner, and does not need to be directly perceptible to humans,” and stated that in the spirit of this, even if the lyrics are encoded within the model’s parameters, it amounts to the creation of a reproduction. It went as far as to mention that “encoding in the form of probabilistic weights does not prevent it from being considered a copy,” showing a strong recognition that differences in technical formats cannot avoid the nature of reproduction under copyright law. Also, since the fact that the model could output the lyrics was not coincidental but highly consistent, it was factually found that “the direct incorporation of the essential part of the training data” occurred rather than the result of statistical learning. As a result, the Munich District Court recognized OpenAI’s liability for injunction and damages regarding the output act of the lyrics in question, and further ordered the provision of information regarding training data and output content for the future. However, this judgment is the first instance, and since OpenAI has indicated an intention to appeal, it is expected to be a continuing dispute.</p><p>The noteworthy theory shown by this GEMA judgment is the extension of the concept of reproduction under copyright law to the interior of the model. That is, if the work used as training data remains within the model and can be reproduced with a simple operation, it means the model already contains a reproduction of that work. This theory is groundbreaking in that it deems “the model contains the source work,” and indeed, in a commentary by Osborne Clarke, it is evaluated that “in contrast to the judgment of the English High Court in the  case, the Munich District Court explicitly recognized the possibility that the AI model contains copies of the training material.” Standing on this view, the model is not merely a result of analysis, but depending on the case, can be evaluated as an aggregate of the training data itself.</p><p>However, it is necessary to keep in mind that this judgment is based on an extreme case where a complete match output was obtained with short text such as lyrics. The court itself stated, “Normally, temporary reproduction for learning remains within the purpose of analysis and does not infringe on the rights holder’s market, but in this case, the model holds the work in a restorable form and exceeds the scope of analysis,” emphasizing that the judgment is limited to “cases where the model performs complete reproduction.” Also, as the UK case shows, judicial decisions vary by country, and a legal consensus on this issue has not yet been formed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the judgment this time, which declared that the recording of a work inside a model is a reproduction, can become a major basis supporting the license propagation theory. This is because, while the premise for discussing GPL propagation is “whether the model can be said to be a reproduction or derivative work of the GPL code,” the logic of the Munich District Court legally certified exactly that “a model can be a reproduction of training data”.</p><h3>Possibilities Derived from the Current Status of the Two Lawsuits</h3><p>From the two lawsuits above, we can consider the path through which the theory of license propagation to AI models might be recognized in the future.</p><p>Let us assume the worst-case scenario from the perspective of AI operators, where these lawsuits are finalized with the plaintiffs winning. In the Copilot litigation, the judgment that “model providers must comply with the license conditions of the training source code” would be established, and in the GEMA litigation, the legal principle that “the model encompasses reproductions of the work” would be established. When these two intersect, the conclusion that “since an AI model containing GPL code is a reproduction or derivative work of the GPL code, the conditions of the GPL directly apply to its provision” is theoretically derived. That is, the possibility emerges that the theory of GPL propagation to models is effectively ratified by the judiciary.</p><p>Specifically, if the model memorizes and contains GPL code fragments internally, the act of distributing or providing that model to a third party may be regarded as the distribution of a reproduction of GPL code; in that case, the act of distribution under conditions other than GPL would be evaluated as a GPL license violation. If a GPL violation is established, there would be room to argue for remedies such as injunctions and claims for damages, as well as forced GPL compliance demanding the disclosure of the entire model under the same license, just as in the case of ordinary software. In fact, the remedies GEMA sought from OpenAI included disclosure regarding training data and output content, and although this is in the context of musical works, this can be said to be a type of disclosure request to make transparent “what the model learned and contains.” In the case of a GPL violation as well, the possibility cannot be denied that demands such as “disclosure of the GPL code parts contained inside the model” or “source disclosure in a form that allows reconstruction of the model” would emerge in seeking license compliance.</p><p>Even if not reaching such an extreme conclusion, an intermediate scenario could involve imposing certain restrictions on model providers. For example, the Copilot litigation might be settled or judged by taking measures such as “attaching a license and author attribution at the time of output if existing code of a certain length or more is included in the generated code,” or technically mandating the implementation of filters so that GPL code fragments are not extracted or reproduced from the model. In fact, GitHub, the developer of Copilot, has already introduced an optional feature that “excludes from suggestions if the candidate code matches existing code on large-scale repositories,” attempting to reduce litigation risk. Also regarding OpenAI, there are reports that it strengthened filters so that ChatGPT does not output copyrighted lyrics as they are, in response to the GEMA judgment.</p><p>While these are not license propagation itself legally, in practice, they indicate that the industry is steering in the direction of “ensuring the model does not potentially infringe license conditions.” In the future, there is a possibility that guidelines for excluding data with specific license terms like GPL at the model training stage, or mechanisms and systems to guarantee that there is no license-infringing output by conducting output inspections after training, will be established.</p><p>In any case, until these two lawsuits are completely settled and the subsequent legislative response is determined, the “theory of GPL propagation to models” has not completely disappeared. It is a scenario that could suddenly become realistic depending on future judgments, and even if the plaintiffs lose in the lawsuits, there is a possibility that support for this theory will reignite within the open source community. It is necessary to note that while it is currently an “undetermined theory not shouted as loudly as before,” that does not mean it has been legally completely denied and resolved. As our community, we need to carefully consider countermeasures while observing these trends and taking into account the legal systems of each country and opposing arguments described in the latter half of this article.</p><h3>Treatment under Japanese Law</h3><p>Based on the trends of the overseas lawsuits mentioned above, I will also organize the relationship between AI models, copyrighted works, and licenses under Japanese law. In Japan, Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, introduced by the 2018 amendment, exists as a provision that comprehensively legalizes reproduction acts associated with machine learning. Furthermore, in March 2024, the Copyright Division of the Council for Cultural Affairs of the Agency for Cultural Affairs published a guideline-like document titled “Thought on AI and Copyright” (hereinafter “the Thought”), presenting a legal organization divided into the development/training stage and the generation/utilization stage of generative AI.</p><p>According to “the Thought,” reproduction performed basically for the purpose of AI training is legal as long as it satisfies “information analysis not for the purpose of enjoying the thoughts or sentiments expressed in the work” as defined in Article 30-4. Therefore, acts of collecting and reproducing a wide range of data from the internet to create a training dataset for research and development purposes can be done without the permission of the rights holders in principle. However, what is important is whether an “purpose of enjoyment” is mixed into that training act. “The Thought” states that if training is conducted with the purpose of “intentionally reproducing all or part of the creative expression of a specific work in the training data as the output of generative AI,” it is evaluated as having a concurrent purpose of enjoying the work rather than mere information analysis, and thus lacks the application of Article 30-4. As a typical example of this, “overfitting” is cited, and acts such as making a model memorize specific groups of works through additional training to cause it to output something similar to those works are judged to have a purpose of enjoyment.</p><p>Furthermore, “the Thought” also mentions the legal treatment of trained models, stating first that “trained models created by AI training cannot be said to be reproductions of the works used for training in many cases.” This is the view that since the model can generate outputs unrelated to the original in response to various inputs in a general-purpose manner, the model itself is not a copy of any specific work.</p><p>However, “the Thought” simultaneously acknowledges the possibility that, exceptionally, in cases where “the trained model is in a state of generating products with similarity to the work that was training data with high frequency,” the creative expression of the original work remains in the model, and it may be evaluated as a reproduction. It also points out that in such cases, the model is positioned as a machine for copyright infringement, and a claim for injunction may be recognized. In short, usually the model is merely statistical data and not the work itself, but if it has turned into a device for spewing out specific works almost as they are, it can be treated as an infringing item; this thinking shares parts with the content of the GEMA judgment.</p><p>It is necessary to note that the above organization is strictly a discussion of the scope of application of rights limitation provisions (exception provisions) under the Copyright Act, and does not touch upon the validity of contracts or license clauses. The Agency for Cultural Affairs document discusses from the perspective of “whether it is copyright infringement or not,” and does not deny that even if the training act is legal, contractual liability may arise if it violates terms of service or open source licenses separately. Also, no in-depth view has been shown regarding the propagation of copyleft clauses like the GPL. In Japan’s Copyright Act, there is no override provision where rights limitation provisions like Article 30-4 take precedence over contract conditions, and the “Contract Guidelines on Utilization of AI and Data” by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry suggests the possibility that if there is a contract prohibiting data use between parties, that contract takes precedence.</p><p>Therefore, if the license is regarded as a valid contract, even if “training is legal” under Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, the risk remains that it becomes a “violation of license conditions” under contract law, and it can be said that at least there is no official view organizing the theory of GPL propagation to models. In other words, currently, while the legality of model training acts is recognized quite broadly under the Copyright Act, license violation is left to general civil theory, and there is no clear guideline on, for example, “whether the act of publicly distributing a model trained on GPL code constitutes a GPL license violation.” Overall, the legal organization in Japan is in a situation of “safe in principle at the copyright layer, but blank at the contract layer.” Hence, the discussion in Japan regarding the theory of GPL propagation to models relies on future judicial judgments and legislative trends, and at present, there is no choice but to consider operational guidelines carefully following the organization by the Agency for Cultural Affairs.</p><h2>Arguments Negating the Theory of License Propagation to Models</h2><p>As seen in the previous sections, the theory of GPL propagation to models is not legally zero. However, many legal experts and engineers point out that this theory has serious detrimental effects. Here, I present representative arguments negating the theory of license propagation to models from the layers of copyright law, GPL text, technology, and practical policy.</p><h3>Arguments for Negation at the Copyright Law Layer</h3><p>First, under copyright law, it is unreasonable to regard an AI model as a “derivative work” or “reproduction” of the training source works. In many cases, the expressions of specific works are not stored inside the model in a form recognizable to humans. The model merely holds statistical abstractions where text and code have been converted into weight parameters, and that itself is not a creative expression to humans at all. A “derivative work” under copyright law refers to a creation that incorporates the essential features of the expression of the original work in a form that can be directly perceived, but one cannot directly perceive the creativity of the original code from the model’s weights. In other words, the model does not show the nature of a work directly enough to be evaluated as encompassing the original code. For example, the High Court of Justice in the UK stated in the judgment of the  case that “the Stable Diffusion model itself is not an infringing copy of the training images,” showing a negative view on regarding the model itself as a reproduction of works. Thus, there are many cautious positions internationally regarding regarding the model itself as an accumulation of works or a compilation work.</p><p>Also, the output generated by the model involves probabilistic and statistical transformations, and in many cases, things that do not resemble the training source at all are output. Even if a match or similarity occurs by chance, it is difficult to prove whether it is a reproduction relying on the original or an accidental similarity. It is not realistic to conduct the certification of reliance and similarity required to discuss copyright infringement for the entire model. Ultimately, in the framework of copyright law, there is no choice but to judge “whether the model relies on a specific work” on a work-by-work basis, and recognizing uniform copyrightability or infringing nature for the model itself is a large leap. As organized in Japanese law where the model is not considered a reproduction in most cases, the schematic of model equals work is considered unreasonable under copyright law.</p><h3>Arguments for Negation at the GPL Text Layer</h3><p>Next, looking at the license text and intent of the GPL itself, doubts are cast on the interpretation that GPL propagates to AI models. For example, in the text of GPLv2, the target of copyleft is limited to “derivative works” of the original code provided under GPL and “works that contain the Program.” Typically, this has been interpreted as software created by modifying or incorporating GPL code, or software combined (linked) with GPL code. In the case of an AI model, it is extremely unclear which part of the original GPL code the model “contains.” Even if the model could memorize fragments of the GPL code used for training, it is a tiny fraction when viewed from the entire model, and most parts are occupied by parameters unrelated to the GPL code. There is no clear assumption shown by the GPL drafters as to whether a statistical model that may partially encapsulate information derived from GPL code can be said to be “a work containing the Program”.</p><p>Furthermore, GPLv3 requires the provision of software source code in a “preferred form for modification.” If an AI model is a GPL derivative, the problem arises as to what that preferred form for modification would be. The model weights themselves have low readability and editability for humans, and are hard to call a “preferred form for modification.” If we ask whether the training data is the source code, the original trained GPL code itself cannot be said to be the source of the model, nor is it clear if it refers to the entire vast and heterogeneous training dataset. It is difficult to define what should be disclosed to redistribute the model under GPL compliance, and it could lead to an extreme conclusion that all code and data used for model training must be disclosed. While this is what some freedom believers aim for, it can only be said to be unrealistic in reality, and it deviates from the point of the GPL’s intent to enable users to modify and build from source. Thus, existing GPL provisions are not designed to directly cover products like AI models, and forcing their application causes discrepancies in both text and operation.</p><p>In fact, in the “Open Source AI Definition” compiled by the OSI (Open Source Initiative) in 2023, regarding “information necessary for modification” of the model, it stopped at stating that sufficiently detailed information about the training data should be disclosed, and did not require the provision of the training data itself in its entirety. Also, it states that model weights and training code should be published under OSI-approved licenses.</p><p>In addition, the FSF (Free Software Foundation) itself does not believe that the current GPL interpretation alone can guarantee freedom in the AI domain, and announced in 2024 that it has started formulating “conditions for machine learning applications to be free.” There, the directionality is shown that “the four freedoms should be guaranteed to users including not only software but also raw training data and model parameters,” but this conversely is a recognition that this is not guaranteed under current licenses. The FSF also points out that “since model parameters cannot be said to be source comprehensible to humans, modification through retraining is more realistic than direct editing,” and can be said to be cautious about treating models on the extension of existing GPL. Overall, claiming GPL propagation univocally to AI models that fall outside the wording and assumptions of GPL provisions is unreasonable from the perspective of interpretation.</p><h3>Arguments for Negation at the Technical Layer</h3><p>There are also strong counterarguments from a technical perspective against the theory of GPL propagation to models. AI models, particularly those called large language models, basically hold huge statistical trends internally and do not store the original code or text as they are like a database. Returning a specific output for a specific input is merely generation according to a probability distribution, and it is not guaranteed that the same output as the training data is always obtained. If the model does not perform verbatim reproduction of training data except for a very small number of exceptional cases, evaluating it as “containing GPL code” within the model does not fit the technical reality. In fact, the OpenAI side argued in the GEMA lawsuit that “the model does not memorize individual training data, but merely reflects knowledge learned from the entire dataset in parameters.” This argument was not accepted by the Munich District Court, but that was because there was a clear example of lyric reproduction; conversely, unless there is a clear example of reproduction, the view would be that “the model is a lump of statistical knowledge”.</p><p>Furthermore, although it has been confirmed that models can output fragments of training data, that proportion is considered extremely limited when viewed from the whole. Regarding the whole as a reproduction based on the existence of partial memory is like claiming the whole is a reproduction of a photograph just because it contains a tiny mosaic-like fragment in an image, which is an excessive generalization. Technically, it is difficult to quantitatively measure how far specific parameters of the model retain the influence of the original data, and the correspondence between the model and training data remains statistical and difficult to draw a line. Therefore, criteria such as “how similar must it be for GPL to propagate?” cannot be established in the first place. The judgment of infringement or not has to be done on an individual output basis, and this would not be consistent with the idea of applying a single license to the entire model. From the technical aspect, since the model is basically a statistical transformation and the majority is unrelated to GPL code, applying GPL collectively can be said to be irrational.</p><h3>Practical and Policy Arguments for Negation</h3><p>Finally, major demerits can be pointed out regarding the theory of license propagation to models from practical and policy perspectives. What would happen if this GPL propagation theory were legally recognized? As an extreme example, if 1 million code repositories were used for training a certain large-scale model, all the various licenses contained in them (GPL, MIT, Apache, proprietary, etc.) would “propagate” to the model, and the model provider would have to distribute the model in a form that complies with all 1 million license clauses. As a practical matter, there would be combinations where conditions contradict, such as GPLv2 and Apache-2.0, and attaching and managing a huge collection of copyright notices for one model is nothing but unrealistic. Applying all licenses to an AI model created from training data with mixed licenses is practically bankrupt, and eventually, the only thing that can be done to avoid it would be to exclude code with copyleft licenses like GPL from the training data from the start.</p><p>Is such a situation really desirable for our community? The spirit of the GPL is to promote the free sharing and development of software. However, if asserting excessive propagation to AI models causes companies to avoid using GPL code, and as a result, the value held by GPL software is not utilized in the AI era, it would be putting the cart before the horse. In the field of software development, many companies take a policy of not mixing GPL code into their own products, but similarly, if it becomes “do not include GPL in our AI training data,” GPL projects could lose value as data sources. Furthermore, the current legal battles surrounding AI are leaning more towards monetary compensation and regulatory rule-making, and the reality is that they are proceeding in a different vector from the direction of code sharing idealized by GPL. If only the theory of GPL propagation to models walks alone, in reality, only data exclusion and closing off to avoid litigation risks will progress, and there is a fear that it will not lead to the expansion of free software culture.</p><p>Policy-wise as well, governments of each country are carefully considering the use of copyrighted works in AI, but at present, there is no example establishing an explicit rule that “license violation of training data generates legal liability for the model.” Even in the EU AI Act, while there are provisions regarding the quality and transparency of training data, it does not demand compliance with open source licenses. Rather, from the perspective of promoting open science and innovation, the movement to allow text and data mining under rights limitations is strong. In Japan as well, as mentioned earlier, the direction is to broadly recognize information analysis use under Article 30-4, and the policy of forcibly applying licenses to AI models is not mainstream in current international discussions.</p><p>Based on the above, the theory of license propagation to models is highly likely to cause disadvantages to open source on both practical and policy fronts, and can be said not to be a realistic solution. What is important is how to realize the “freedom of software,” which is the philosophy of open source, in the AI era; the opinion that this should be attempted through realistic means such as ensuring transparency and promoting open model development rather than extreme legal interpretations is potent, and this is something I have consistently argued as well.</p><h2>The Stance of OSI and FSF</h2><p>I will also organize what stance major organizations in the open source (and free software) community are currently taking in relation to the theory of GPL propagation to AI models. Representative organizations are the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF); while they share the goal of software freedom, they do not necessarily take the same approach regarding AI models and training data.</p><p>First, the OSI formulated the “Open Source AI Definition” (OSAID) in 2024, defining the requirements for an AI system to be called open source. This definition states that the four freedoms (use, study, modify, redistribute) similar to software should be guaranteed for AI systems as well, and defines requirements regarding “forms necessary for modification” to realize that, requiring the disclosure of the following three elements.</p><ul><li>Data Information: Provide sufficiently detailed information about the data used for training so that a skilled person can reconstruct an equivalent model.\n<ul><li>This does not make publishing the training data itself in its entirety mandatory, but requires disclosing the origin, scope, nature, and acquisition method if there is data that cannot be published, listing data that can be published, and providing information on data available from third parties.</li></ul></li><li>Code: Publish the complete set of source code for training and running the model under an OSI-approved license.</li><li>Parameters: Publish the model weights (parameters) under OSI-approved conditions.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that while OSI states that information regarding the code used for training and training data is indispensable in addition to model weights to realize “Open Source AI,” it does not require the complete disclosure of the training data itself. This is a flexible stance that, for example, if raw data cannot be published due to privacy or confidentiality, explaining the nature of the data by clarifying that fact can substitute. Also, the legal mechanism to ensure free use of model parameters is an issue to be clarified in the future, and at present, no conclusion has been reached on legal rights control (e.g., presence or absence of copyrightability) over parameters either.</p><p>As can be read from these, the OSI promotes opening up AI models at the level of the open source definition in principle, but keeps the handling of training data to requirements at the information disclosure level. Thereby, it can be said that the OSI avoids adopting the theory of license propagation to models to demand training data disclosure, and is exploring a realistic solution that first guarantees transparency and reproducibility. In principle, it could be said that the OSI denied the GPL propagation theory at the time of publishing the OSAID definition. Note that I am probably the one who sealed the mandatory argument for training data in the final stage of this definition’s formulation process, and I believe this was the correct judgment.</p><p>On the other hand, the FSF and FSF Europe (FSFE) take a stance more faithful to fundamental principles. FSFE declared as of 2021 that “for an AI application to be free, both its training code and training data must be published under a free software license.” That is, to modify or verify the model, one must be able to obtain it including the training data, and therefore both must be free. Also, the FSF itself stated in a 2024 statement, “Under current understanding, for an ML application to be called free, all training data and the scripts processing it must satisfy the four freedoms,” trying to extend the requirements of freedom to data. Thus, FSF/FSFE stands on the position that a model with undisclosed training data is unfree as a whole even if the software part is free.</p><p>However, the FSF simultaneously states to the effect that “whether a non-free machine learning application is ethically unjust depends on the case,” mentioning that there can be “legitimate moral reasons” for not being able to publish training data (personal information) of a medical diagnosis AI, for example. In that case, it implies that although that AI is non-free, its use might be ethically permitted due to social utility. One can see an attitude of seeking a compromise between the FSF’s ideal and reality here, but in any case, there is no mistake that the FSF ultimately aims for freedom including training data.</p><p>So, does the FSF support the theory of GPL propagation to AI models? Not necessarily. Their claim is closer to an ethical standard or ideal image rather than legal enforceability, and they are not arguing that it applies to models as an interpretation of the current GPL license. Rather, as mentioned before, they are at the stage of trying to create new standards and agreements. Even in the white paper on the Copilot issue funded by the FSF, while legal points such as copyright and license violation are discussed, substantially it has a strong aspect of being told as a GPL compliance problem for users (downstream developers) concerned that they bear the risk of GPL violation if Copilot’s output contains GPL code fragments. This is a caution to developers using AI coding tools rather than GPL application to the model itself, and is different from an approach forcing GPL compliance directly on model providers.</p><p>The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) naturally has a strong interest in this issue but is also cautious in some respects. The SFC started the protest campaign “Give Up GitHub” against GitHub in 2022, condemning Copilot’s methods as contrary to the philosophy of open source, and is also involved in the Copilot class action. However, in an SFC blog post, regarding this lawsuit, it showed concern about “the risk of interpretations deviating from the principles of the open source community being brought in,” and called on the plaintiffs’ side to comply with community-led GPL enforcement principles as well. The SFC also states that Copilot’s act is an “unprecedented license violation,” and while not fully denying the GPL propagation theory, it can be interpreted as fearing that a judicial precedent undesirable for the community might be created depending on the result of the legal battle. The SFC might be said to be carefully balancing between the aspect of pursuing GPL propagation and the risk of entrusting it to the judiciary.</p><p>Finally, what is concerned as the free software camp is that excessive propagation of licenses might conversely invite results that impair freedom. Both OSI and FSF ultimately want to make AI something open that anyone can utilize, but they are carefully assessing whether increasing the purity of legal theory in demands for full data disclosure really leads to achieving the objective. Considering the demerits such as the avoidance of open data due to excessive propagation interpretation or the atrophy effect due to a flurry of lawsuits, I feel that the major organizations share a commonality in that it is essential not to lose sight of the big picture of spreading freedom. Rather than inciting GPL application to models, the pursuit of realistic solutions such as how to make models and data open and which parts should be relaxed in line with reality will likely continue in the future.</p><p>I have looked at the current state of the theory of GPL propagation to AI models above, and as a conclusion, this theory is in a halfway position where “it is not touted as loudly as before, but it has not completely disappeared.” As a result of points such as license violation of training data and reproduction within the model beginning to be scrutinized in lawsuits like the Copilot class action and , it even appears that the hurdle for infringement certification is lowering. In fact, the Munich District Court’s judgment deemed model memory as reproduction, and the claim of open source license violation survives in the Copilot litigation.</p><p>However, on the other hand, the hurdle for the propagation of licenses like GPL remains high. There is a large gap between infringement being recognized and the conclusion that the entire model must be disclosed under GPL etc. immediately. What the current lawsuits are seeking is also injunctions and damages, not the forced GPL-ization of the model. There are zero examples where the judiciary supported the theory of GPL propagation to models itself, and it is a legally uncharted territory. Even if that claim were attempted somewhere in the future, it would face the legal, technical, and practical counterarguments mentioned earlier.</p><p>However, the situation has fluid parts, and there is a possibility that the line will shift depending on the policies of each country and the trends of the community. For example, if pressure from rights holder groups strengthens in Europe, there is a possibility that guidelines including license compliance will be formulated. Also, if a consensus is formed within the community regarding the state of copyleft in the AI era, a new license might appear. If such changes occur, a phase where the theory of propagation to models is re-evaluated will also arrive.</p><p>To offer my personal opinion, what is important at this moment is the perspective of how to balance software freedom and freedom in the AI domain. Instead of blindly trying to apply the philosophy of copyleft to AI, it is necessary to think about what is best to maximize freedom while considering the technical nature and industrial structure peculiar to AI. Fortunately, solutions to practical problems such as the open publication of large-scale AI models, dataset cleaning methods, and automated attachment of license notices are already being explored by the open source community. Promoting such voluntary efforts and supporting them with legal frameworks as necessary will likely be the key to balancing freedom and development.</p><p>The theory of GPL propagation to models is a point where judgment is divided on whether it is an ideal to be pursued or a nightmare to be avoided. However, as stated in this article, seeing the situation in the current year of 2025, it is not a situation where it will become reality immediately, and the majority of the community is likely maintaining a cautious stance. Although it is speculated that trial and error will continue in the judicial, legislative, and technical aspects in the future, as our community, we need to continue exploring the point of compatibility between technological innovation and software freedom without jumping to hasty conclusions. That process itself can be said to be a new challenge in the AI era on the extension of the free software spirit.</p>","contentLength":44807,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46068777"},{"title":"Arthur Conan Doyle explored men’s mental health through Sherlock Holmes","url":"https://theconversation.com/arthur-conan-doyle-explored-mens-mental-health-through-his-sherlock-holmes-stories-246728","date":1764240842,"author":"PikelEmi","guid":168,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Arthur Conan Doyle was not just one of the world’s best crime fiction writers. He was a progressive wordsmith who brought light to controversial and taboo subjects. One of those taboo subjects was male vulnerability and mental health problems – a topic of personal significance to the author.</p><p>The character of Sherlock Holmes is a true expression of male vulnerability that does not equate it with weakness. Doyle does not represent Holmes as infallible, but as a man others can relate to – he battles with drug addiction, loneliness and depression. His genius thrives in part because of these vulnerabilities, not despite them.</p><p>In The Man with the Twisted Lip, for example, a man named Neville St Clair hides his double life. He tells his family that he is a respectable entrepreneur going to London on business. In reality he is begging on the city streets. He lives this double life due to fear and shame over the inability to pay off his debts. “It was a long fight between my pride and the money,” he explains, “but the dollars won at last.” </p><p>“I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children,” St Clair says. In having his character consider execution to protect his and his family’s reputation, Doyle explored the societal expectations of Victorian masculinity and how men struggled with such pressures. </p><p>The Stockbroker’s Clerk also examines male suicide, as well as economic and professional anxieties. When Holmes reveals the crimes of Harry Pinner, the man attempts suicide rather than face prison. </p><p>In The Engineer’s Thumb, hydraulic engineer Victor is treated physically by Watson and mentally by Holmes. As Doyle writes: “Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.”</p><p>The physical injury marks Victor as a victim of physical violence. Watson suggests that Victor is using all his mental capabilities to keep calm about his severe pain. Holmes treats Victor’s mind as he listens to his story: “Pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.” </p><p>Holmes is a protector, a confidante and a comforter in this scene. He provides Victor with breakfast, induces him to lie down and offers him a stimulant (more than likely brandy).  </p><p>The extremity of violence that Victor has endured has escalated to mental trauma. In having Holmes treat Victor’s mental trauma while Watson treats his physical pain, Doyle showed the importance psychological support for men of the age. </p><p>Holmes was a highly popular character. To contemporary readers, his drug use and dysfunctional clients were seen as markers of his genius rather than a reflection of the significant social issues that men faced during this period. But today, they offer a window into the mental struggles of Victorian men, and a point of connection between readers of the past and present. </p><p><em>Looking for something good?

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.</p><p>That, at least, is what a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111\">new peer-reviewed study</a> from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.</p><p>The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.</p><p>To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.</p><p>\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" </p><p>Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. </p><p>\"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"</p><p>But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.</p><p>The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.</p><p>To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.</p><p>\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.</p><p>\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"</p><p>To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083\">Michael Jackson's death</a> but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"</p><p>The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.</p><p>So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.</p><p>\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\"><p>The results were striking.</p><p>Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"</p><p>Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"</p><p>The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. </p><p>If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.</p><p>\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"</p><p>Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.</p><p>If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.</p><p>As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.</p></div>","contentLength":6701,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46065817"},{"title":"DIY NAS: 2026 Edition","url":"https://blog.briancmoses.com/2025/11/diy-nas-2026-edition.html","date":1764212063,"author":"sashk","guid":164,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Fourteen years ago, my storage needs outpaced my capacity and I began to look into building a network attached storage server. I had a few criteria in mind and was curious to see if anyone had _ recently_ shared something similar, but I couldn’t find anything that was relevant.</p><p>In fact, I found that the communities I was looking for answers in were actively hostile towards what I wanted to do.  This resulted in my decision <a href=\"https://blog.briancmoses.com/2012/01/do-it-yourself-network-attached-storage.html\" title=\"My First DIY NAS: Building a NAS: Choosing Hardware\">to build my own DIY NAS</a> and share that as one of my very first blogs.</p><p>Much to my surprise, people were very interested in that blog! Ever since, I’ve been building a similar DIY NAS machine almost every year, trying to satisfy the curiosity of other prospective DIY NAS builders.</p><ol><li>: It’s not the case for me anymore, but at the time the space was limited in my office. I always assume that space in everybody’s office is limited. As a result, I want my DIY NAS builds to occupy as little of that office space as I can.</li><li>: Back when I built my NAS, it took about four drives’ worth of storage to meet my storage needs. Plus, I desired two empty drive bays for future use. However, in the years since, hard drive capacities have increased dramatically. At some point in the future, I may reduce this to four drive bays.</li><li><strong>An integrated, low-power CPU</strong>: I intend my DIY NAS to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year. When it comes to power consumption, that can do some damage on your electric bill! Thankfully, our electricity here isn’t as expensive as others’ in the United States, or even further outside its borders, but I try and keep power consumption in mind when picking components for a DIY NAS build.</li><li>: It does not take up a lot of CPU horsepower for a NAS to serve up files, which means that on modern hardware there’s a lot of untapped potential in a DIY NAS for virtual machines and/or containers to self-host services.</li></ol><p>It’s important to remember that , and not necessarily yours.

Hard drives, SSDs, and RAM prices were all rising. Based on what I’ve been told, I expect Intel CPU prices to increase as well. My contact at Topton has been encouraging me to stock up on motherboards while they still have some in inventory. Based on what’s been explained to me, I expect the motherboards’ prices to rise and for their availability to potentially dwindle.</p><p>In short, the economy sucks, and the price of DIY NAS components is a pretty good reflection of just how sucky things are becoming. I briefly considered not publishing a DIY NAS build this year, hoping that things would improve a few months down the road.

Each DIY NAS since then has also featured a Topton motherboard. My only complaint about the motherboards has been that buying them from one of the Chinese e-tail sites like AliExpress is considered problematic by some. With every DIY NAS build, I try and go through all the motherboards that I can find  while searching for something with a better value proposition, but for each of the past three years I’ve landed on the latest offering from Topton.</p><p><a href=\"https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)\"><img src=\"https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/topton_n22_175.png\" align=\"right\"></a>For the , I chose the <a href=\"https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c2zJj1aF\" title=\"Topton N22 N355 Mini-ITX NAS Motherboard (8xSATA3, 2xM.2, 1x10Gbps, 2x2.5Gbps)\">Topton N22 motherboard</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/231803/intel-processor-n100-6m-cache-up-to-3-40-ghz/specifications.html\" title=\"Intel® Processor N100\">Intel Core 3 N355</a> CPU.

At its price, it’s a compelling value proposition!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C6DQDNT?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=a917ad99ae5994be300a55a6e8fc8fe2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.Black.swap, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (120mm, Black) \"><img src=\"https://blog.briancmoses.com/images/2026/diynas/pp/NF-A12x25_175.png\" align=\"right\"></a>In the past, I’ve found that the fans that come with JONSBO cases are too noisy. They’ve been noisy for two reasons: The design and quality of the fans make them loud, and the fans are constantly running at their top speed because of the fan header they’re plugged into on the cases’ SATA backplanes.</p><p>I anticipated that fan efficiency and noise would be a problem, so I picked out the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C6DQDNT?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=diynas2026-20&amp;linkId=a917ad99ae5994be300a55a6e8fc8fe2&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.Black.swap, Premium Quiet Fan, 4-Pin (120mm, Black) \">Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM</a> to solve it.

Secondly, I’d address the problem by plugging the fan into the motherboard’s  header instead of on the SATA backplane.

Building the  compared to prior years’ felt a lot like coming home to put on sweatpants and a T-shirt after wearing a suit and tie all day long.</p><p>I wasn’t too fond of the cable management of the power supply’s cables. The layout of the case pretty much makes the front of the power supply inaccessible once it is installed. One consequence of this is that the power cable which powered the SATA backplane initially prevented the 120mm case fan from spinning up. That issue was relatively minor and was resolved with zip ties.</p><p>Overall, I felt pretty good about the assembly of the , but things would take a turn for the worse when I decided to fill all the 3.5-inch drive bays up with some of my decommissioned 8TB HDDs.

I still really like its size; it feels big when you’re working in it with a Mini ITX motherboard. If you wind up deciding to use the JONSBO N4, then I suggest that you put those four drives and their cables in first before you do anything else. That would’ve made a world of difference for me. Looking at the documentation before getting started might have saved me quite a bit of aggravation, too!</p><p>Generally speaking, I do as little as I possibly can in the BIOS. Normally, I strive to only set the time and change the boot order. However, I did a bit more for the  since I’m using the  header for the fan responsible for cooling the hard drives.  Here are the changes that I made in the BIOS:</p><ol><li>Set the  and  to Greenwich Mean Time\n    <ol><li>Advanced\n        <ol><li>Hardware Monitor ( Advanced)\n            <ol><li>Set  to  .</li><li>Set the  (for ) to 180.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Set  to </li><li>Boot\n        <ol><li>Set  to the TrueNAS boot device.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>I’m not at all interested in venturing into the rabbit’s hole of trying to completely minimize how much power the NAS uses. However, I imagine there are some opportunities for power savings lurking in the BIOS. I didn’t go looking for them myself, but if you’re intrepid enough to do so, here are a few suggestions that I have for saving some additional power:</p><ul><li>Disable the onboard audio.</li><li>Disable any network interfaces that you don’t wind up using.</li><li>Tinker with the CPU settings.</li><li>Got other suggestions?  <em>Share them in the comments!</em></li></ul><p>Because all of the hardware is brand-new to me and brand-new components are not guaranteed to be free of defects, I always do a little bit of burn-in testing to establish some trust in the hardware that I’ve picked out for each DIY NAS build. While I think doing  burn-in testing is critically important, I also think the value of subsequent burn-in testing drops the more that you do. Don’t get too carried away, and do your own burn-in testing in moderation!</p><p>I  use Memtest86+ to burn-in the RAM. I always run at least 3+ passes of Memtest86+. Typically, I run many more passes because I tend to let the system keep running additional passes overnight. Secondarily, running these many passes gives the CPU a little bit of work to do and there’s enough information displayed by Memtest86+ to give me confidence in the CPU and its settings.</p><p>The failure rate of hard drives is highest when the drives are new and then again when they’re old. Regardless of type of hard drives that I buy or when I buy them, I always do some disk burn-in. I tend to run <a href=\"https://github.com/Spearfoot/disk-burnin-and-testing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Spearfoot's disk-burnin-and-testing Script on GitHub\">Spearfoot’s Disk Burn-in and Testing script</a> on all of my new drives.

As a result, I wouldn’t recommend comparing these results with results that I shared in prior years’ DIY NAS build blogs.

Several months ago, I realized that there were several off-the-shelf NAS machines that were more than capable of running TrueNAS, and they were selling at economical prices that couldn’t be topped by a DIY approach. I will dive deeper into this in a future blog, eventually … ?</p><p>All that being said, it’d be incredibly easy to make some compromises which result in the  becoming quite a bit more economical. Here’s a list of changes that I would consider to achieve a more budget-friendly build:</p><p>Altogether, these savings could add up to more than $400, which is pretty considerable!  If you made all of these changes, you’d have something that’s going to be nearly equivalent to the  but at a fraction of the price.</p><h2>What am I going to do with the DIY NAS: 2026 Edition?!</h2><p>My DIY NAS is aging quite gracefully, but I’ve recently been wondering about replacing it. Shortly before ordering all the parts for the , I briefly considered using this year’s DIY NAS build to replace my personal NAS. However, I decided not to do that.

Here in Taiwan it’s particularly bad: I’ve\nhad shop staff tell me about some discount if you download their app, and when I\ndecline, say something like “It’s really easy! Here, just give me your phone and\nI’ll do it for you.” Once when I was setting up my phone plan, the staff wanted\nmy phone to, idk, note my IMEI or something, and then when I wasn’t paying\nattention, installed a local e-commerce app, using my new phone number and name\nas login details, then proudly told me, “Now you get 300NTD off your first phone\nbill!” Thanks, for 10$ I can get weekly text and email spam from Shopee, great.</p><p>So first tip, in Taiwan, never hand your phone over the counter.</p><p>Second tip, never download the app. Corps have all sorts of ways to try to\nconvince you: Use the app to order in-store rather than the kiosk, get free\nchicken nuggets. Download our app at checkout, get a discount. Whatever the\nreason, don’t do it, you’re giving more than you’re getting.</p><p>First, we’ve entered an era defined by\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism\">surveillance capitalism</a>.\nCompanies try to get as much data on you as possible, and then treat you\ndifferently based on the data they have on file for you. We all know this as\nseeing poorly-tuned ads (you just bought a refrigerator? You must love\nrefrigerators! Here’s 100 refrigerator ads), but the new trend is\n<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/\">surveillance pricing</a>.\nA company will know that you just got paid and so charge you just a bit more for\nyour chicken nuggets than they do when you haven’t been paid in two weeks.\nAnnoying, don’t download them app, don’t give them more data than they already\nhave.</p><p>The other scary thing though is that that gives the power of currency valuation\nto companies. Without surveillance pricing, everyone pays the same for a\ncheeseburger. Rich people can buy more cheeseburgers, sure, but at least the\nprice of cheeseburgers is pegged against a dollar, so if someone starts charging\ntoo much for cheeseburgers, you can take your dollars to a competitor. Once\ncompanies can start charging individual prices, the global economy doesn’t\ndetermine how many cheeseburgers your dollars can buy, McDonald’s does. Way too\nmuch power to give to these companies that already have too much power.</p><p>Second reason, binding arbitration. Binding arbitration is when you sign an\nagreement with someone that has a clause that says, “if there’s a dispute, we\ndon’t sue eachother, instead we go through a private process outside the court\nsystem and let a mediator decide the outcome.” Bonus, unlike judges, whose\nsalaries are paid for by the taxpayers and therefore you don’t pay a “judge fee”\nwhen you go to court (mostly), a mediator needs to be hired. Guess who hires\nthem? Not you!</p><p>Walking into a restaurant to buy a cheeseburger, there’s no way a company can\nforce you to enter a contractual agreement that includes binding arbitration.\nDownloading an app, however, requires agreeing to a “Terms of Service,” and\nthose can  include a binding arbitration clause, and that clause can\nbe applied even to cases outside the app. This happened to Jeffrey Piccolo when\nhis wife died of food poisoning in a Disney World. Disney made a motion to\ndismiss because a couple years back, Jeffrey had signed up for a free trial of\nDisney+, which included a binding arbitration clause, which meant that if\nJeffrey wanted to complain about how Disney murdered his wife, they’d have to\nsettle it out of court with a mediator that Disney hired. No jury, no judge, no\noversight. In the end the only reason Disney dropped this motion is because the\nnews picked it up. That won’t always happen.</p><p>At least in the USA, binding arbitration is totally cool according to the\nSupreme Court, so don’t count on the government to save you. You need to take\npersonal steps to make sure you aren’t signing your rights away. So, don’t\ndownload apps.</p><p>Predictions: Sometime in the next 5 years, someone will be forced into\narbitration with Uber after being hit by one of their self driving cars, because\nthey use Uber Eats. Sometime in the next 5 years, someone’s house will burn down\nfrom their Tesla exploding, and they’ll be forced into arbitration because they\nhad a Twitter account, and Twitter is now a subsidiary of TeXla. Sometime in the\nnext 5 years, an Amazon employee who lost a finger on the job will be forced\ninto arbitration because they have a WaPo subscription.</p><p>If you want to learn more,\n<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/27/shit-shack/\">Cory Doctorow</a> covers the topic\nin much more detail.</p>","contentLength":4502,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46061623"},{"title":"Gemini CLI tips and tricks for agentic coding","url":"https://github.com/addyosmani/gemini-cli-tips","date":1764180482,"author":"ayoisaiah","guid":155,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46060508"},{"title":"DRAM prices are spiking, but I don't trust the industry's why","url":"https://www.xda-developers.com/dram-prices-spiking-dont-trust-industry-reasons/","date":1764177121,"author":"binarycrusader","guid":154,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46059737"},{"title":"OpenAI needs to raise at least $207B by 2030","url":"https://ft.com/content/23e54a28-6f63-4533-ab96-3756d9c88bad","date":1764169597,"author":"akira_067","guid":153,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46058065"},{"title":"Voyager 1 is about to reach one light-day from Earth","url":"https://scienceclock.com/voyager-1-is-about-to-reach-one-light-day-from-earth/","date":1764165766,"author":"ashishgupta2209","guid":152,"unread":true,"content":"<p>After nearly 50 years in space, NASA’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Voyager 1</a> is about to hit a historic milestone.

Light of different colors is illuminating the window.\"><h2>I don't care how well your \"AI\" works</h2><p>The other day I was sitting on the doorstep of a hackerspace, eating a falafel sandwich while listening to the conversation inside. The topic shifted to the use of “AI” for everyday tasks, people casually started elaborating on how they use “chat assistants” to let them write pieces of code or annoying emails. The situation is a blueprint for many conversations I had in recent months. What followed in most of them, almost like a reflex, was a self-justification of why the way  use these tools is fine, while other approaches were reckless.</p><p>I find it particularly disillusioning to realize how deep the LLM brainworm is able to eat itself even into progressive hacker circles.</p><p>I encountered friends who got fully sucked into the belly of the . Proficient, talented coders who seem to experience some sort of existential crisis. Staring at the screen in disbelief, unable to let go of Cursor, or whatever tool is  right now. Soaking in an unconscious state of harmful coping. Seeing that felt terrifyingly close to witnessing a friend developing a drinking problem.</p><p>And yeah, I get it. We programmers are currently living through the devaluation of our craft, in a way and rate we never anticipated possible. A fate that designers, writers, translators, tailors or book-binders lived through before us. Not that their craft would die out, but it would be mutilated — condemned to the grueling task of cleaning up what the machines messed up. Unsurprisingly, some of us are not handling the new realities well.</p><p>I personally don’t touch LLMs with a stick. I don’t let them near my brain. Many of my friends share that sentiment.</p><p>But I think it’s important to acknowledge that we’re in a priviliged situation to be able to do so. People are forced to use these systems — by UI patterns, bosses expectations, knowledge polution making it increasingly hard to learn things, or just peer pressure. The world adapts to these technologies, and not using them can be a substantial disadvantage in school, university, or anywhere.</p><p>A lot of the public debate about AI focuses on the quality of its output. Calling out biases, bullshit marketing pledges, making fun of the fascinating ways in which they fail, and so on. Of course, the practical issues are important to discuss, but we shouldn’t lean too much on that aspect in our philosophy and activisim, or we risk missing the actual agenda of AI.</p><p><strong>No matter how well “AI” works, it has some deeply fundamental problems, that won’t go away with technical progress.</strong> I’d even go as far and say they are intentional.</p><p>Our ability to use tools is an integral part of the human experience. They allow us to do things that we otherwise couldn’t do. They shape how we think, and consequently who we are.</p><p>When we use a tool, it becomes part of us. That’s not just the case for hammers, pens, or cars, but also for a notebook used to organize thoughts. It becomes part of our cognitive process. Computer are not different. While I’m typing this text, my fingers are flying over the keyboard, switching windows, opening notes, looking up words in a dictionary. All while I’m fully focused on the meta-task of getting my thoughts out, unaware of all the tiny miracles happening.</p><p>Our minds are susceptible to outside cues. When we read news articles we tend to believe what seems plausible. When we review code we generally expect it to behave the way it looks, even when we don’t have the context to assess that. The same is true for text: When we let a model transform notes into a blog post, a lot of context and nuance is added. We read it and believe the output to be what we thought. It’s subtle.</p><blockquote><p>on a deeper level, writing is more than just the process by which you obtain a piece of text, right? it’s also about finding out what you wanted to say in the first place, and how you wanted to say it. this post existed in my head first as a thought, then it started to gel into words, and then i tried pulling those words out to arrange them in a way that (hopefully) gets my point across. there is nothing extra there, no filler. i alone can get the thought out and writing is how i do that.</p></blockquote><p>In a world where fascists redefine truth, where surveillance capitalist companies, more powerful than democratically elected leaders, exert control over our desires, do we really want their machines to become part of our thought process? To share our most intimate thoughts and connections with them?</p><p>AI systems exist to reinforce and strengthen existing structures of power and violence. They are the wet dream of capitalists and fascists. Enormous physical infrastructure designed to convert capital into power, and back into capital. Those who control the infrastructure, control the people subject to it.</p><p>AI systems being egregiously resource intensive is not a side effect — </p><p>Craft, expression and skilled labor is what produces value, and that gives us control over ourselves.

He considers an already tiny cell and wonders: Are there even smaller cells that make a home there?</p><p>“The difference [in size between parasitic and host cells] can sometimes be like that between a human and Godzilla,” Nakayama said. He is fascinated by the potentially vast amount of undiscovered biodiversity these relationships might contain, and his lab looks for such relationships in seawater. The ocean is a nutrient-poor environment that incentivizes cells to form <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-ocean-teems-with-networks-of-interconnected-bacteria-20250106/\">trading partnerships</a>. Sometimes they <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/microbes-also-change-the-climate-could-that-help-us-20250915/#microbiome\">float along together</a>, loosely tethered, exchanging rare nutrients and energy. Other times their arrangements are more organized.</p><p> is a globally widespread single-celled dinoflagellate that has a walled, pouchlike external chamber for housing symbiotic cyanobacteria. Nakayama and his team searched for the alga by scooping seawater samples from the Pacific Ocean using a fine-mesh net. A common technique is to sequence whatever DNA can be found in the soup of such a sample, an approach called metagenomics.</p><p>“That method is incredibly powerful for capturing a broad overview,” Nakayama said. “However, with such data, it is often difficult to maintain the link between a sequence and the specific cell it came from, and rare organisms can be easily missed.” His team’s more targeted approach involves microscopically identifying and physically isolating a single target cell from that mixed sample.</p><p>Back on shore in the Tsukuba lab, after the researchers confirmed they had , they sequenced every genome associated with that one cell. As expected, they found DNA from its symbiotic cyanobacteria, but they found something else, too: sequences that belong to an archaeon, a member of the domain of life thought to have given rise to <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/meet-the-eukaryote-the-first-cell-to-get-organized-20241028/\">eukaryotes</a> like us.</p><p>At first, Nakayama and his colleagues thought they had made a mistake. The archaeal genome is tiny: just 238,000 base pairs end to end. In comparison, humans have a few billion base pairs, and even  bacteria work with several million. (’ symbiotic cyanobacteria have 1.9 million base pairs.) Previously, the smallest known archaeal genome was the one belonging to  at 490,000 base pairs, it is more than twice as long as the new one the researchers found. They initially figured that this tiny genome — too large to be merely statistical noise — was an abbreviated piece of a much larger genome, erroneously compiled by their software.</p><p>“At first, we suspected it might be an artifact of the genome-assembly process,” Nakayama recalled. To check, the team sequenced the genome using different technologies and ran the data through multiple computer programs that assemble fragments of DNA sequences into a full genome. The various approaches all reconstructed the exact same 238,000-base-pair circular genome. “This consistency is what convinced us it was the real, complete genome,” he said.</p><p>This meant that Nakayama and his team had a new organism on their hands. They named the microbe  Sukunaarchaeum mirabile (hereafter referred to as Sukunaarchaeum) for its remarkably tiny genome — after Sukuna-biko-na, a Shinto deity notable for his short stature, plus a Latin word for “extraordinary.”</p><h2><strong>The Spectrum of Quasi-Life</strong></h2><p>When the team consulted databases of known genes to analyze the archaeon, they found its small size was the result of a whole lot that was missing.</p><p>Sukunaarchaeum encodes the barest minimum of proteins for its own replication, and that’s about all. Most strangely, its genome is missing any hints of the genes required to process and build molecules, outside of those needed to reproduce. Lacking those metabolic components, the organism must outsource the processes for growth and maintenance to another cell, a host upon which the microbe is entirely dependent.</p><p>Other symbiotic microbes have scrapped much of their genomes, including Sukunaarchaeum’s evolutionary relatives. The researchers’ analysis suggested that the microbe is part of the DPANN archaea, sometimes called nanoarchaea or ultra-small archaea, which are characterized by small size and small genomes. DPANN archaea are generally thought to be symbiotes that cling to the outside of larger prokaryotic microbes, and plenty of them have substantially reduced genomes to match that lifestyle. But until now, none of the DPANN species had genomes quite this pared back. And Sukunaarchaeum branched off the DPANN lineage early, suggesting that it had taken its own evolutionary journey.</p><p>“This realm of the archaea is pretty mysterious in general,” said <a href=\"https://marinescience.utexas.edu/directory/brett-baker\">Brett Baker</a>, a microbial ecologist at the University of Texas, Austin who was not involved in the work. “[DPANN archaea are] obviously limited in their metabolic capabilities.”</p><p>While Sukunaarchaeum&nbsp;may provide some undetermined benefit for its host — which could be , the symbiotic cyanobacteria or another cell entirely — it’s probably a self-absorbed parasite. “Its genome reduction is driven by entirely selfish motives, consistent with a parasitic lifestyle,” said <a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/timothy-williams\">Tim Williams</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Technology Sydney who was not involved in the study. It cannot contribute metabolic products, so the relationship between&nbsp;Sukunaarchaeum&nbsp;and any other cell would likely be a one-way street.</p><p>Other microbes have evolved similarly extreme, streamlined forms. For instance, the bacterium , which lives as a symbiont within the guts of sap-feeding insects, has an even smaller genome than Sukunaarchaeum, at around 159,000 base pairs. However, these and other super-small bacteria have metabolic genes to produce nutrients, such as amino acids and vitamins, for their hosts. Instead, their genome has cast off much of their ability to reproduce on their own.</p><p>“They are on the way to becoming organelles. This is the way mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have evolved,” Williams said. “But Sukunaarchaeum has gone in the opposite direction: The genome retains genes required for its own propagation, but lost most, if not all, of its metabolic genes.”</p>","contentLength":6561,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46055935"}],"tags":["dev","hn"]}
