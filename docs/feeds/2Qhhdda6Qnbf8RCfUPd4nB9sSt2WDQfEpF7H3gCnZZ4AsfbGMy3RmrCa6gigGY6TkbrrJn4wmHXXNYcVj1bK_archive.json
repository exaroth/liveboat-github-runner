The idea comes from a similar tool I previously developed in PHP, which brought value by enforcing architectural integrity in large-scale projects. I wanted to see if I could replicate that thing in Rust.</p> <p>Here&#39;s an example:</p> <pre><code>let project = Project::from_relative_path(file!(), &quot;./../src&quot;); let rules = ArchitecturalRules::define() .component(&quot;Application&quot;) .located_at(&quot;crate::application&quot;) .may_depend_on(&amp;[&quot;Domain&quot;]) .component(&quot;Domain&quot;) .located_at(&quot;crate::domain&quot;) .allow_external_dependencies(&amp;[&quot;serde&quot;]) .must_not_depend_on_anything() .finalize(); let result = Arkitect::ensure_that(project).complies_with(rules); assert!(result.is_ok()); </code></pre> <p>Iâ€™d love to hear from anyone who tries it out in a real project. You can find the project here: <a href=\"https://github.com/pfazzi/rust_arkitect\">GitHub</a>.</p> <p>If you have ideas, run into issues, or just want to share how youâ€™re using it, feel free to reach out or open an issue.
