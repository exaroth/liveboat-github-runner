Additionally, applications increasingly need to expand out to the edge and cloud-native stacks simply don't work in those environments. Fortunately with NATS, we don't need a stack. In this session you'll see how we can leverage compute, storage, and connectivity to build cloud-to-edge native apps more powerful than ever, with less code, effort, and frustration.</article>","contentLength":899,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ypsAus_OBmo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ChatLoopBackOff - Episode 43 (KubeVela)","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClbJB-m0Kc4","date":1737698511,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":367,"unread":true,"content":"<article>KubeVela, an incubating CNCF project, is a modern application delivery platform that simplifies the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.

Why? What really happens when you set these things up? How do you use them effectively without bankrupting your whole organization? In this session, we'll dig into the nuts and bolts of what goes on under the hood of a multi-zone cluster, including what a zone is, what Kubernetes understands about zones, how zones affect routing, and why multi-zone clusters can drive costs up. We'll spend some time on Kubernetes' Topology Aware Routing, covering its advantages as well as its very real limitations. Finally, we'll dive into how you can influence Kubernetes' choices to take advantage of multi-zone clusters' reliability while containing costs.

Back then, relational databases lacked the availability and scalability characteristics required by Kubernetes. However, as Etcd encountered challenges with various Kubernetes workloads, relational databases continued to evolve. This session is a practical guide for deploying fault-tolerant and scalable Kubernetes clusters on distributed PostgreSQL. We’ll begin with Kine, which integrates into the Kubernetes architecture, enabling relational databases for cluster metadata management. Then, we’ll use Kine to deploy Kubernetes on a single-server PostgreSQL instance. After that, we’ll migrate to a multi-node PostgreSQL instance, allowing Kubernetes to tolerate zone and region outages and scale to thousands of nodes on demand.</article>","contentLength":1206,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/VdF1tKfDnQ0?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Efficient LLM Deployment: A Unified Approach with Ray, VLLM, and Kubernetes - Lily (Xiaoxuan) Liu","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3NW-gV1OtA","date":1737680375,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":364,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

Many factors impact the cost of running AI/ML workloads such as GPU utilization, GPU VM size, idle time, etc. These costs are often ignored and considered inherent in running GPU workloads. But if running workloads at scale and left unoptimized, costs will quickly spin out of control. In this talk, we leverage NVIDIA DCGM exporter with Prometheus for GPU metrics monitoring alongside OpenCost to measure the Kubernetes spend of our GPU workloads. We will provide an overview of OpenCost, highlighting its role in bridging the gap between the developer and platform teams through visibility and accountability of spend. We will demonstrate how to use the NVIDIA GPU Operator and how techniques such as partitioning can lead to significant cost savings.</article>","contentLength":1384,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/sH699gmFC0o?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Managing and Distributing AI Models Using OCI Standards and Harbor - Steven Zou","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eiXSogHxmQ","date":1737676922,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":355,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!
