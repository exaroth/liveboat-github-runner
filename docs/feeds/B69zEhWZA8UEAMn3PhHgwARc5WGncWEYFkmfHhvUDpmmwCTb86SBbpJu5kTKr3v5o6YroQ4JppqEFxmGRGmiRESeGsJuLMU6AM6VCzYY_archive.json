During this session led by maintainers we will give a brief update on 2.0, but will spend more time looking at the ecosystem around us. Why does containerd exist? What value does it bring to the overall cloud native world? How are other projects using it to build and extend containerd in useful ways? We’ll spend some time on containerd’s largest subproject, nerdctl, which also has an upcoming 2.0 release, and additionally catch the community up on activity in our Rust subproject ecosystem, the runwasi containerd shim, and lazy loading snapshotters. Since this is KubeCon, we’ll also provide an update on CRI changes and KEP-driven additions around NRI, DRA, and checkpoint/restore. Attendees will leave with a broad view of the larger containerd ecosystem of projects as well as key information on how to get involved if you are interested to help and contribute in any way to the “containerd neighborhood!”</article>","contentLength":1477,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/kCNhgNXVdxw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Welcome & Introduction: A Hitchhiker's Guide to the CNCF Landscape- Katherine Druckman, Lori Lorusso","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCAOa0-VdU","date":1737848276,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":423,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

With cgroup v2 available in Kubernetes since v1.25, we're at a crossroads where many users and organizations must decide when and how to transition fully to this new system. Despite the benefits of cgroup v2, including better resource management and enhanced capabilities, users frequently encounter unexpected challenges signaling a gap in readiness and understanding. This talk will address the practical implications of moving to cgroup v2, discuss the coordinated efforts to deprecate cgroup v1, and propose actionable strategies to bridge the gap between the Kubernetes community, system administrators, and developers. By focusing on real-world experiences and providing clear guidance, this session aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this significant change confidently.</article>","contentLength":1364,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/JWwwtW8Hbjs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lightning Talk: Minimizing Data Loss Within the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector - Alex Kats","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxRkfVXdy9E","date":1737837526,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":421,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

However, as a single component in a wider observability architecture, it is only as reliable as the downstream platforms/services it exports data to. The OTel collector has several built in mechanisms that aim to minimize the impact of unhealthy downstream exporters, including an out of the box sending queue with an additional configuration parameter for persistent queueing. There is a new component in the OTel contrib distribution, the Failover Connector. The Failover Connector allows for dynamic routing or “failover” of telemetry data based on downstream exporter health. This provides significant improvement to the data resiliency of the collector, as telemetry data can be continuously exported to a set of stable secondary locations, while the issues with the primary are resolved.</article>","contentLength":1309,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/xxRkfVXdy9E?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"KubeSlice: Migrate Kubernetes Services With Confidence! | Project Lightning Talk","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkl7EnILe-o","date":1737836485,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":420,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

When SREs are asked to move the K8S services to a different Cloud cluster they hit a roadblock - there is no easy solution to provide private endpoint FQDN access to a managed service from a remote Cloud cluster.\n\nCNCF sandbox project KubeSlice solves this use case in an elegant way.\n\nKubeSlice enables SREs to create a Slice across clusters and slice overlay network connects services in the clusters. An external services gateway on the Slice in the original Cloud cluster will provide access to managed services via alias service FQDN import. Services in other clusters can reach the cloud service via the same private endpoint FQDN resolved by the Slice DNS.</article>","contentLength":1389,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Xkl7EnILe-o?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Now You See Me: Tame MTTR with Real-Time Anomaly Dete...

You are running an application on a Kubernetes cluster &amp; you notice that your nodes have been restarting and your users are noticing that your application is unreachable. As an engineer, you want to identify these failures in real-time &amp; differentiate these from known states, at scale. But we know, static thresholds fail for dynamic metrics! This session explores real-time anomaly detection for cloud-native systems. We'll show you how to reduce MTTR and mean time to analyse by proactively identifying abnormal application behavior using statistical &amp; machine learning algorithms on time series data from Prometheus. Learn to pinpoint issues, identify missing instrumentation, and visualize anomalies using Grafana. This session equips you to achieve faster issue resolution and maintain optimal application health. We'll demo practical techniques for metrics selection, anomaly detection and proactive issue identification to manage your cloud-native applications.</article>","contentLength":1420,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Ipc0SOhB9OM?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nothing but NATS - Going Beyond Cloud Native - Byron Ruth & Kevin Hoffman, Synadia","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypsAus_OBmo","date":1737761567,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":418,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

Additionally, applications increasingly need to expand out to the edge and cloud-native stacks simply don't work in those environments. Fortunately with NATS, we don't need a stack. In this session you'll see how we can leverage compute, storage, and connectivity to build cloud-to-edge native apps more powerful than ever, with less code, effort, and frustration.</article>","contentLength":899,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/ypsAus_OBmo?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","k8s"]}
