During this session led by maintainers we will give a brief update on 2.0, but will spend more time looking at the ecosystem around us. Why does containerd exist? What value does it bring to the overall cloud native world? How are other projects using it to build and extend containerd in useful ways? We’ll spend some time on containerd’s largest subproject, nerdctl, which also has an upcoming 2.0 release, and additionally catch the community up on activity in our Rust subproject ecosystem, the runwasi containerd shim, and lazy loading snapshotters. Since this is KubeCon, we’ll also provide an update on CRI changes and KEP-driven additions around NRI, DRA, and checkpoint/restore. Attendees will leave with a broad view of the larger containerd ecosystem of projects as well as key information on how to get involved if you are interested to help and contribute in any way to the “containerd neighborhood!”</article>","contentLength":1477,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/kCNhgNXVdxw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Welcome & Introduction: A Hitchhiker's Guide to the CNCF Landscape- Katherine Druckman, Lori Lorusso","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCAOa0-VdU","date":1737848276,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":395,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

With cgroup v2 available in Kubernetes since v1.25, we're at a crossroads where many users and organizations must decide when and how to transition fully to this new system. Despite the benefits of cgroup v2, including better resource management and enhanced capabilities, users frequently encounter unexpected challenges signaling a gap in readiness and understanding. This talk will address the practical implications of moving to cgroup v2, discuss the coordinated efforts to deprecate cgroup v1, and propose actionable strategies to bridge the gap between the Kubernetes community, system administrators, and developers. By focusing on real-world experiences and providing clear guidance, this session aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this significant change confidently.</article>","contentLength":1364,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/JWwwtW8Hbjs?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","k8s"]}
