This release introduces partial support for namespaced CEL policies to confine enforcement and minimize RBAC, aligning with least-privilege best practices. Observability is significantly enhanced with full metrics for CEL policies and native event generation, enabling precise visibility and faster troubleshooting. Security and governance get sharper controls through fine-grained policy exceptions tailored for CEL policies, and validation use cases broaden with the integration of an HTTP authorizer into ValidatingPolicy. Finally, we’re debuting the Kyverno SDK, laying the foundation for ecosystem integrations and custom tooling, with maturity planned in 1.17.

Even with encryption at rest and in transit, telemetry data is often exposed during collection and processing.\n\nIn this lightning talk, we’ll show how to secure observability pipelines on Kubernetes using confidential computing-enabled nodes. We demonstrate how observability components (e.g., Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry Collector, Loki) can run inside hardware-isolated Kubernetes nodes, ensuring that telemetry data is encrypted at the source and only processed by trusted, attested workloads.\n\nAttendees will learn a practical, zero-intrusion design that combines Kubernetes-native observability tools with confidential compute infrastructure to deliver end-to-end encrypted, trusted observability, ideal for regulated workloads in finance, healthcare, and government.</article>","contentLength":1414,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/aEuWgYoMS98?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lego Bricks for Developers: Turning Insights Into Golden Paths at Neo4j- Jeremy Adams & Luke Beamish","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdLXeK8motg","date":1764037182,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":377,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

Reducing time-to-response means optimizing not only how far your workloads have to travel (network latency) but also how fast they spin up and execute once they arrive (compute latency). Solving one without the other leaves users waiting.\nThis talk introduces Spin, the open source developer toolkit that uses WebAssembly (Wasm) to reduce compute latency to near-zero. With sub-millisecond cold starts and scale-to-zero efficiency, Spin apps can be built in a local dev loop and then deployed anywhere with no changes to the code. That same application can be deployed to any SpinKube cluster or globally across Akamai’s 4,000+ edge locations. The result is serverless applications that feel instant, no matter where users are.</article>","contentLength":1306,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/dAZfS4MZzPE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Lightning Talk: Service Quality Management for Critical Edge Applications - Jaime Burbano","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKspaqa1PTs","date":1764005387,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":370,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!
