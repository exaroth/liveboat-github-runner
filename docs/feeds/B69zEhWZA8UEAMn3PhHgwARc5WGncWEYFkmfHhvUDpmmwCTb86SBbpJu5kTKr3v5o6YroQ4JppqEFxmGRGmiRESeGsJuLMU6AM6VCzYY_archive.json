This session will cover how we utilized Kubernetes with Cluster API and other cloud native components, to deploy a cell-based architecture across multiple cloud providers, scaling to 270+ clusters and 18,000+ nodes, creating independent, isolated cells that limit failures and improve uptime, thus simplifying compliance, cost management, and disaster recovery planning.\n\nWe'll explore how Cluster API facilitates seamless automation of cluster creation and management across our multi-cloud setup, upgrades, enhancing autonomy and resilience. Moreover, we'll highlight real-world use cases sharing our learnings from automation built for efficient management of k8s clusters while limiting operational overhead.\n\nEnd users will learn from this talk on how they can use ClusterAPI, to automate their multi cloud cluster lifecycle management and leverage cellular architecture to build a highly available setup.</article>","contentLength":1545,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/4DjydLH21nM?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"ChatLoopBackOff Episode 59 (​OpenCost)","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_9pSJ8GlFs","date":1745012334,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":382,"unread":true,"content":"<article>OpenCost is an incubating CNCF open source project used for measuring and allocating cloud infrastructure and container costs in real time.

Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nFrom Chaos To Clarity: Scaling Observability at Dropbox With Centralized Logging Solution - Alok Ranjan, Dropbox Inc\n\nAt Dropbox, managing observability for systems producing terabytes of logs daily posed a unique challenge. Initially, developers accessed logs by logging into individual servers, a process further complicated when we moved to containers. Containers are short-lived, which caused logs to disappear on termination. This highlighted the need for a scalable, persisted, centralized solution using open-source tools.\n\nIn this session, I’ll discuss our journey to build a robust observability framework centered on Loki as our logging solution. Scaling Loki to Dropbox’s data volume required extensive optimizations for reliable, efficient query performance. I’ll cover our deployment, challenges, and strategies for achieving high-performance logging.\n\nWe also integrated Grafana to unify logs and metrics in a single view, enhancing troubleshooting and security. Join us to learn how Dropbox scaled its observability with open-source solutions and key lessons from our experience.</article>","contentLength":1507,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/sGzY-o0Z2rI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Observability Day | Closing Remarks - Anna Kapuścińska & Austin Parker, Program Committee Co-Chairs","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd-8rkLugFc","date":1744912478,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":370,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

While this migration promises reduced latency and enhanced privacy, challenges come: maintaining accuracy within limited resources, and cross-device deployment problems.\n\nThe integration of KubeEdge and WasmEdge addresses the challenge. WasmeEdge is a lightweight, portable runtime (less than 50MB) without external dependencies. The KubeEdge Sedna orchestrates the edge-cloud collaboration. It monitors inference accuracy and automatically routes requests to cloud-based models when edge processing doesn't meet accuracy thresholds.\n\nThis session will demo that small LLMs provide quick, local inference at the edge. When higher accuracy is needed, Sedna seamlessly transitions to larger models in the cloud. The inference workload is built in Rust and compiled to Wasm, enabling deployment across edge and cloud without any changes.\n\nThe solution has been implemented in production across multiple industries like aerospace and bank branches.</article>","contentLength":1545,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/opz-m9KKE28?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","k8s"]}
