Meshery makes infrastructure and application management less about finger-pointing and more about collaborating.\n\nEngineering teams all too often find themselves siloed, using disparate tooling, inconsistent workflow, and have a lack of collaboration and shared process. By facilitating shared workspaces, a catalog of cloud native patterns, and a multi-player experience, Meshery empowers teams to work together effectively, streamlining infrastructure design and operational management.\n\nJoin CNCF Ambassador, Ahmed Bebars as he explores how Meshery seamlessly integrates with every CNCF project and your Kubernetes clusters.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/d2E4qDd3_Aw?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes Growth to $9.7 Billion: The Future of Tech #kubernetes #cloudnative #futuretech #ai","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zynq9Qu9jA0","date":1735947999,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch the Keynote Panel titled “End User Evolution: Cloud Native Adoption Stories from India and Beyond.” The panel features Rajas Kakodkar from Broadcom, Aparna Subramanian from Shopify, Bob Killen from the CNCF, Achyuta Ghosh from nasscom, and Sudheesh Sudhakaran from VMware.

Usage of x509 certificates is the key thing. Be it K8s deployments in private or public cloud, ensuring availability of \"right\" X509 certificate for a service is very important. If this service is getting connected from external (apps/clients which are outside of K8s cluster) clients, this is even more important! But what is really the \"right\" x509 certificate and how can we ensure that is always remains \"right\"? Can we make corrections dynamically? Can we also ensure easy propagation of certificates imported from outside the cluster? Propagation of Certificate revocation lists to ensure services can deny revoked certificates?\n\nThis talk helps describe the strategy K8s based products can use to dynamically generate, make correction and propagation of X509 certificates within K8s cluster using K8s operator design pattern and makes use of well-known CNCF projects such as cert-manager and trust-manager.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/4OTUNSI3DG4?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes: Food Festival Analogy Explained #kubernetes #foodfestival","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqdIlESawDg","date":1735933591,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/lqdIlESawDg?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes Optimization: Save Your Job & Budget! #kubernetes #cloudoptimization","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puiQcCW4pxQ","date":1735933536,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/puiQcCW4pxQ?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes Costs: 2024 Cloud Native Challenges #kubernetes #cloudcost #cloudcostoptimization","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCFGxE0XykM","date":1735933479,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/nCFGxE0XykM?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes Needs a Linux Moment NOW! #kubernetes #linux","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkRRXCehWyA","date":1735933374,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/wkRRXCehWyA?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes Optimization: Carpenter Saves You $$$ #kubernetes #costsaving","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKB6hQomotE","date":1735933335,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/RKB6hQomotE?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"2025 Cloud Native: Complexity and Chaos! #kubernetes #cloudnative #complexity #chaosengineering","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WiA0B0gcA0","date":1735933153,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/4WiA0B0gcA0?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubernetes vs AI: Who Wins #kubernetes #ai #cloudnative","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so4prwSBisM","date":1735932984,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"content":"Watch Nikhita Raghunath, Principal Software Engineer at Broadcom, in her keynote titled \"The Cloud Native Story So Far: What Worked, What Didn’t and What Will!” by clicking the link above.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/so4prwSBisM?version=3","enclosureMime":""}]}
