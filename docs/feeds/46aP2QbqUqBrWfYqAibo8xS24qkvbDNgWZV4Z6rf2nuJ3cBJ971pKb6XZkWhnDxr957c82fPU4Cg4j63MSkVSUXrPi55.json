to power bringing a hard-line anti-immigration agenda, promising crackdowns on irregular migration and mass deportations.</p><p>When the plane landed in the northern city of Manaus, Brazilian

Only countries that are considered allies are now allowed to access these computer chips. And Switzerland is not one of them.</p><p>Only 18 countries are considered trustworthy allies in the US, including France, Germany and Japan. According to Washington, these nations are worthy of unrestricted access to these very powerful computer chips, which are manufactured exclusively by US companies.</p><p>This new regulation will come into force in four months.

The official US Department of Commerce document lists those countries they trust to protect their technology and have no restrictions. However, no individual statements were made regarding the excluded countries.</p><p>Nevertheless, it seems clear that the main aim of this regulation is to deny rival countries, especially China, access to this cutting-edge technology. The US is not only trying to curb exports, but also to prevent Chinese companies from circumventing the restrictions by setting up subsidiaries abroad.</p><p>Baranova is therefore calling on the Swiss government to show the US that Switzerland meets the criteria to be considered a trustworthy partner. âIt is clearly up to Switzerland to demonstrate its reliability and provide the US with additional guarantees.â</p><p>The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) is currently analysing the document and its potential impact on companies and research institutions. According to SECO, discussions have already begun with the US authorities to ensure that this regulation does not hinder research or innovation in Switzerland.</p><p>SECO also points out that Switzerland is home to US companies and their research centres that make heavy use of these chips, such as Google.</p><p><em>Translated from German by DeepL/ds</em></p><div aria-label=\"Infobox\" x-bind:class=\"isOpen &amp;&amp; '--is-open'\" x-data=\"infobox({isOpen: false})\"><div x-show=\"isOpen\" x-collapse=\"\" x-bind:aria-hidden=\"!isOpen\"><p>This news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.
