Here's the pitch:<p><i>Anki AI Utils</i> is a suite of AI-powered tools designed to automatically improve cards you find challenging. Whether you're studying medicine, languages, or any complex subject, these tools can:<p>- <i>Explain</i> difficult concepts with clear, ChatGPT-generated explanations.<p>- <i>Illustrate</i> key ideas using Dall-E or Stable Diffusion-generated images.<p>- <i>Create mnemonics</i> tailored to your memory style, including support for the Major System.<p>- <i>Reformulate</i> poorly worded cards for clarity and better retention.<p><i>Key Features:</i><p>- <i>Adaptive Learning:</i> Uses semantic similarity to match cards with relevant examples.<p>- <i>Personalized Memory Hooks:</i> Builds on your existing mnemonics for stronger recall.<p>- <i>Automation Ready:</i> Run scripts daily to enhance cards you struggled with.<p>- <i>Universal Compatibility:</i> Works across all Anki clients (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS).<p><i>Example:</i><p>For a flashcard about febrile seizures, Anki AI Utils can:<p>- Generate a <i>Dall-E illustration</i> of a toddler holding a teacup next to a fireplace.<p>- Create <i>mnemonics</i> like \"A child stumbles near the fire, dances symmetrically, has one strike, and fewer than three fires.\"<p>- Provide an <i>explanation</i> of why febrile seizures occur and their diagnostic criteria.<p><i>Call for Contributors:</i><p>This project is battle-tested but needs help to become a polished Anki addon. If you’re a developer or enthusiast, join us to make these tools more accessible!<p><i>Check out my other projects on GitHub:</i> [Anki AI Utils](<a href=\"https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub\">https://github.com/thiswillbeyourgithub</a>)<p>Transform your Anki experience with AI—because learning should be smarter, not harder.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534931\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42534931</a></p>\n<p>Points: 237</p>\n<p># Comments: 35</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: Minimal, self-hosted exercise tracker","url":"https://github.com/bmtwl/exerciseminimilism","date":1735339542,"author":"DrPhish","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>After decades of tracking my exercise programs in progressively more complex spreadsheets I eventually burned out on metrics and complicated periodization programs to the point where I had almost stopped exercising.<p>I am now at a place where I simply want the minimal amount of structure and tracking to make sure I can maintain my fitness, so I boiled the entire concept down to what I felt was its essence: enough information and structure to remind you of what is needed today, and how it went on the same exercises last week.<p>To reduce friction, the interface is kept as simple as possible. Simple to the point where all setup is done by editing the html source file and there is only one freeform \"weight\" textbox per exercise to manipulate. Data is autosaved as it is entered. It never nags or judges you except by showing the last date you entered data in for that day-of-the-week's exercises. The only quality-of-life feature is a super-simple rest period timer in the footer.<p>It has no external dependencies and only uses browser local storage. There is no possibility of monetizing it.<p>I was on the fence about sharing since it is such a small and simple project, but decided I would share here in case anyone is looking to make a fresh start in the new year and finds the philosophy appealing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526769\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42526769</a></p>\n<p>Points: 124</p>\n<p># Comments: 39</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: Kando – A cross-platform pie menu for your desktop","url":"https://kando.menu/","date":1735327957,"author":"schneegans","unread":true,"content":"\n<p>Kando is a cross-platform open source pie menu which I am currently developing!

It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.). This avoids any trackers by default.<p>You can find more details on the homepage of the project:<p><a href=\"https://www.fixbrowser.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.fixbrowser.org/</a><p>I'm currently running a fundraiser to get it really going.
