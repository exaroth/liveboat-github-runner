U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday the 2023 debt ceiling extension agreed by then House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden will \"go down as one of the dumbest political decisions made in years.\"\n\n4. Finnish police said on Sunday they had found tracks that drag on for dozens of kilometres along the bottom of the Baltic Sea where a tanker carrying Russian oil is suspected of breaking a power line and four telecoms cables with its anchor.\n\n5. Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks broadcast on Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. \n\n#News #jimmycarter #joebiden #donaldtrump #us #southkorea #jejuair #planecrash #usdebtceiling #finland #underseacable #balticsea #syria #ahmedalsharaa #middleeast #russia #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/bcaWsJFBPVY?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Empire State Building lights up after Jimmy Carter's death","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEYRM9DdtvM","date":1735569028,"author":"Associated Press","unread":true,"content":"New York's iconic Empire State Building was lit up in red, white and blue on Sunday following the death of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.

In a post on X, the Carter Center said that Jimmy Carter died peacefully, surrounded by his family. The former US president governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women's rights and America's global role. \n\nHis achievements in office included brokering a landmark peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1978 known as the Camp David Accords. For that he would later win the Nobel Peace Prize. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy, largely shaped by his work after leaving the presidency in 1981. \n\nHe was the first US president to live to be a 100 years old. \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#JimmyCarter #USA #CampDavid","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/yfO5mGADqx0?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Poland to close the border with Belarus.
