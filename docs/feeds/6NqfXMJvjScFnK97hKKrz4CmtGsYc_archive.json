Since taking charge of X -- formerly known as Twitter -- Elon Musk has used the social media platform as a platform for his own political views. And, after spending millions of dollars helping to secure Donald Trump’s return to the White House, he's now wading into European politics -- expressing support for far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe, including here in Germany. In December, he tweeted his support for the far-right, Alternative for Germany party -- or AfD. With a general election in February, the AfD is polling second - and parts of the party are being monitored by German domestic security services as \"possible threats to democracy\". \n\nHe's also attacked Germany's leaders, saying that Chancellor Olaf Scholz, \"should resign immediately,\" and calling him an \"incompetent fool\". And of German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, he said, \"Steinmeier is an anti-democratic tyrant! Shame on him\".  Berlin has accused Elon Musk of election interference. \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n#musk #afd #democracy","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/-GUvVxsY5mU?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Congress certifies Trump win, four years after Capitol riot | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBkeWOYFN2A","date":1736205998,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"content":"In stark contrast to the 2021 assault on the US Capitol, Congress formally certified Republican President-elect Donald Trump's election victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, clearing the way for him to be sworn in on Jan. 20.  \n\n#News #USA #Elections #Trump #Harris #Politics #Election2024 #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3W9UcXL \n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/wBkeWOYFN2A?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Stung by high prices, Argentines seek cheaper Nikes abroad | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_-KBXofmpo","date":1736205628,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"content":"In the shopping malls of Santiago de Chile and the beaches of Brazil, Argentines are snapping up clothes, electronics and caipirinhas, taking advantage of cheaper prices in other countries as domestic costs in dollar terms spike on a stronger local peso.  \n\n#News #Argentina #Inflation #Americas #Economy #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/4gGy2Ex\n\n👉  Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/U_-KBXofmpo?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Viral ‘Zynfluencers’ Are Fueling a Risky Nicotine Hype Cycle","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWwHhK4Mcz8","date":1736204658,"author":"Bloomberg Television","unread":true,"content":"Zyn represents success for Philip Morris’ “smokeless” strategy and also a major challenge: How can the company sell cigarette alternatives that aren’t so tempting it gets in trouble for hooking kids?
