For users of screen readers, a missing announcement can mean confusion, distrust, or exclusion—yet the issue often remains invisible to most developers and designers. In this talk, we’ll explore how the absence of spoken feedback impacts accessibility, trust, and user experience, particularly for people navigating dynamic web interfaces. Drawing on real-world examples and practical scenarios, we’ll examine the root causes of “silent failures” (such as missing ARIA live regions, improper roles, stale live-region content) and discuss how seemingly minor markup decisions ripple into major accessibility barriers. Attendees will walk away with a clear framework for diagnosing and remedying these silent gaps: from audit strategies and end-user testing through to implementable code patterns, best practices for dynamic announcements, and how to integrate these into your UI/component library workflow. Whether you’re working in React, Web Components, or template-driven apps, you’ll gain actionable insights to ensure your components announce properly, your users feel heard, and your silent UI becomes truly inclusive.\n\n**Key take-aways:**\n\nWhy missing announcements matter: the user-experience impact beyond visual cues\n\nCommon pitfalls in dynamic content, live regions, and state changes\n\nA developer-friendly approach to audit, test, and fix announcement gaps\n\nHow to bake these practices into your component library or design system (for example, your team’s work with PatternFly and a custom theme)\n\nTips for collaboration between developers, UX designers, and accessibility testers to maintain accessibility as your product evolves\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1959,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/x2KwuVDGG10?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The Open Source Community Playbook: What Works, What Doesn’t, and Why- DevConf.IN 2026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAy4mgyX61Q","date":1771423085,"author":"DevConf","guid":610,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Title: The Open Source Community Playbook: What Works, What Doesn’t, and Why\n\nSpeaker(s): Pritesh Kiri\n\n---\nIn this talk, I’ll share a practical playbook for creating and sustaining a healthy open source community, drawn from my experience building projects like LitmusChaos, ToolJet, and ReactPlay.

The core challenges remain the same—managing communication, balancing load, and coordinating resources but the abstractions and tooling are now defined by PyTorch Distributed.\n\nThis talk bridges the gap between traditional HPC paradigms and PyTorch's distributed computing ecosystem, designed specifically for deep learning workloads. We'll explore how familiar HPC concepts like collective operations, point-to-point communication, and process groups, manifest in PyTorch's distributed APIs. We'll discover how PyTorch builds upon battle-tested communication backends (NCCL, Gloo, MPI) while introducing novel primitives optimized for gradient synchronization and model parallelism. We then move beyond basic data parallelism to explore advanced memory-saving techniques like Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), PyTorch's native answer to memory scaling and touch upon the nascent Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism APIs, demonstrating how these techniques compose to train massive models.\n\nThis session equips you with a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch's distributed architecture and reveals the inner workings of one of the most actively developed areas in modern ML infrastructure. By mapping distributed systems concepts to PyTorch's implementation, you'll see how familiar patterns from parallel computing manifest in PyTorch's ecosystem and where there is still room for innovation and improvement.\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1798,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/rzJSJsglFYY?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"How to attack AI systems (and how to defend them) !!!! - DevConf.IN 2026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvBiMiIrW3w","date":1771423084,"author":"DevConf","guid":607,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Title: How to attack AI systems (and how to defend them) !!!!\n\nSpeaker(s): Huzaifa Sidhpurwala\n\n---\n\nAI systems today demonstrate impressive capabilities—but they also introduce a rapidly expanding attack surface.

Federated Learning (FL) offers the following two advantages for model update: (1) It aggregates learnings from data patterns of fleet of vehicles to provide a sophisticated model that has been trained on wide range of scenarios. (2) It protects the privacy of the vehicle user without sending raw data to the central repository for model updates. With simulated vehicle data and Flower FL framework, a range prediction solution has been developed in a manner so as to easily port to an embedded edge Texas Instruments platform.

This session shows how Terraform Actions, combined with the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP), transforms Terraform from a provisioning tool into an operational control plane. With Terraform managing infrastructure state and Ansible executing configuration and remediation workflows, teams can unify provisioning and operations into a single, governed workflow. Using the new Terraform action for AAP, a single terraform apply can trigger Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) to execute dynamic automation across Red Hat environments. The result is a repeatable, policy-driven model for Day-2 operations that reduces operational friction, eliminates ad-hoc access, and improves reliability at scale.\n\n**Target Audience:** Developers, Architects, DevOps, Security, SRE\n\n---\n\nFull schedule, including slides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2026/schedule/</article>","contentLength":1242,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/_AUUM2GAk9g?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nomad: Lightweight Orchestration That Complements Kubernetes- DevConf.IN 2026","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdqcWquAKgI","date":1771423083,"author":"DevConf","guid":604,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Title: Nomad: Lightweight Orchestration That Complements Kubernetes\n\nSpeaker(s): Shaheen Sayyed\n\n---\nWhen it comes to orchestration, Kubernetes tends to steal the spotlight — but it’s not the only way to run workloads at scale. **HashiCorp Nomad** offers a simpler, lighter approach to scheduling containers, VMs, and even raw binaries — without the operational overhead.\n\nWe’ll explore what makes Nomad a practical alternative (or complement) to Kubernetes.

He’ll share lessons learned translating advanced research into products that operate safely in dynamic environments, and why many organizations underestimate the challenges and opportunities of AI in the physical world.</p><p>Nick Gillian, Ph.D., is Co-Founder and CTO of Archetype AI with over 15 years of experience turning advanced AI and interaction research into real-world products. At Archetype, he leads the AI and engineering teams behind Newton—a first-of-its-kind Physical AI foundational model that can perceive, understand, and reason about the physical world. Before co-founding Archetype, Nick was a Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Google and a researcher at MIT, where he developed AI and ML methods for real-time sensor understanding. At Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group, he led machine learning research that powered breakthrough products like Soli radar and Jacquard, and helped advance sensing algorithms across Pixel, Nest, and wearable devices.</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Timestamps:[00:00] Physical Agent Framework[00:56] Physical AI Clarification[06:53] Building a Repair Model[12:41] World Models and LLMs[17:17] Data Weighting Strategies[24:19] Data Diversity vs Quantity[38:30] R&amp;D and Product Creation[41:22] Construction Site Data Shipping[50:33] Wrap up</p>","contentLength":2241,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/115127698/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2026-1-6%2F417599641-44100-2-b7037fd434326.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Joe Rogan Experience #2450 - Tommy Wood","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPfN2G0RyQM","date":1770400829,"author":"PowerfulJRE","guid":618,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Tommy Wood, PhD, is a neuroscientist and athletic performance coach.
