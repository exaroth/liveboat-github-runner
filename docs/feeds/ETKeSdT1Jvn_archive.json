We've transformed this process by building a distributed multi-agent system that enables parallel quantitative evaluation of hundreds of product concepts. Our system combines three key components: an Agentic innovation lab generating high-quality product concepts, synthetic consumer panels using fine-tuned foundational models validated against historical data, and an evaluation framework that correlates with real-world testing outcomes. We can talk about how this architecture enables rapid concept discovery and digital experimentation, delivering insights into product success probability before development begins. Through case studies and technical deep-dives, you'll learn how we built an AI powered innovation lab that compresses months of product development and testing into minutes - without sacrificing the accuracy of insights.</p><p>With over 15 years of leadership experience in AI, data science, and analytics, Luca has driven transformative growth in technology-first businesses.

However, these models require significant resources, making them difficult to use in resource-constrained educational settings. This proposal explores how Small Language Models (SLMs) — simpler, open-source and more affordable AI systems — can transform education by offering personalized learning and scalable solutions, even in low-resource environments.\n\nIntroduction:\nSLMs are smaller, simpler versions of AI models that are easier to use and cost less. Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which need powerful computers, SLMs can work on basic devices, making them ideal for schools with limited budgets. They maintain efficiency and accessibility while offering targeted solutions tailored to specific educational needs. By focusing on domain-specific knowledge, local languages, and contextual customization, SLMs address the equity and inclusivity gaps often exacerbated by larger models.\n\nMethodology:\nThis approach leverages insights from recent implementations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in education. Key methodologies include:\n1. Fine-tuning on Localized Data: Customizing SLMs to address specific learner needs and proficiency levels.\n2. Using Lightweight AI Frameworks: Deploying open-source, resource-efficient tools for underserved communities and low-resource settings.\n3. Integrating SLMs into Systems: Adding SLMs to existing learning platforms to create personalized plans and adjust lessons based on students' progress.\n4. Real-World Success Stories: Demonstrating how SLMs enhance teaching through automation, support student progress, and operate efficiently without high-end infrastructure.\n\nDemo Proposal:\nWe will showcase a live demonstration to highlight how Small Language Models (SLMs) can be effectively deployed in real-world educational settings. The demonstration will feature:\nPersonalized Learning Assistant:\nA fine-tuned open-source Small Language Model(SLM) will be used to create personalized learning plans tailored to students' progress and feedback. The key benefits include:\n1. Adaptability to Individual Needs: The system adjusts the complexity of learning materials based on each student’s progress. For slow learners, subjects are presented gradually, with difficulty levels, without overwhelming them. This step-by-step progression builds confidence, enhances engagement, and promotes a deeper understanding of concepts, contributing to their long-term success and mental well-being.\n2. Affordability in Resource-Constrained Settings: SLMs are optimized for low-resource hardware, making them a cost-effective solution for schools and communities with limited budgets.\nThis demo will illustrate how SLMs can empower educators and improve learning outcomes, making quality education accessible to all.\n\nStrengths of SLMs:\nSmall Language Models offer several key advantages for education:\n1. Low Resource Requirements: They run on basic devices like low-cost laptops or mobile phones.\n2. Cost-Effective: Affordable for schools with limited budgets or in developing regions.\n3. Ease of Updates: Easy to adapt to new curricula or local content.\n4. Privacy-Friendly: On-device processing ensures student data security.\n5. Personalization: Tailors learning to individual student needs and paces.\n6. Support for Local Languages: Adaptable to regional languages and cultural contexts.\n7. Energy Efficient: Uses less energy, supporting sustainable AI use.\n8. Scalable: Easy to implement across schools and districts.\n\nLimitations of SLMs:\n1. Less Powerful: SLMs may struggle with complex tasks like handling multi-disciplinary contexts or generating nuanced responses.\n2. Performance Risks: Aggressively scaling down models can lead to degraded accuracy, especially for tasks requiring deep understanding.\n3. Requires Careful Design: Achieving balance between simplicity and performance demands thoughtful optimization and regular evaluation.\n\nReferences\n1.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386358963_Applications_of_Artificial_Intelligence_for_Modern_Businesses_and_Entrepreneurial_Decision_Making_A_Systematic_Review\n2. https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/ANALYSIS_AND_MODELING_OF_STATE-LEVEL_POLICY_AND_LEGISLATIVE_TEXT_WITH_NLP_AND_ML_TECHNIQUES/27956481?file=50976462\n3.  https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-46677-9_40\n4.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608023000195\n---\n\nSlides and other resources: \nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2025/talk/RZSTYK/</article>","contentLength":4713,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/z-NWvJe8NBw?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"From Fragmented to Unified:Transforming Management & Governance of Data & AI assets- DevConf.IN 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5NY0f5J79g","date":1744092041,"author":"DevConf","guid":558,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Avinash Singh, Puja Thacker\n\n---\nIn today’s data-driven landscape, organizations in finance and healthcare face the dual challenges of managing sensitive data—such as revenue and patient information—and dealing with data fragmentation across different systems and formats.

While IP address is a scarce resource, every last pod in Kubernetes demand its own IP address. From infrastructure design perspective, it presents a challenge. A key aspect of container networking is IP address management, which often gets overlooked. How Kubernetes assigns IP address to pods is determined by the IPAM (IP Address Management) plugin being used. Different IPAM plugins provide different feature sets. This talk throws some light on how some of the open source CNI plugins tackles the challenge of IP exhaustion and approaches IPAM.\n---\n\nSlides and other resources:\nhttps://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-in-2025/talk/BW7EBE/</article>","contentLength":777,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/LMoOVfbuVWU?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Natural Language Meets Video: Querying Videos Like a Database - DevConf.IN 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBjrSfJR8Yk","date":1744092040,"author":"DevConf","guid":555,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Speaker(s): Kedar Basutkar\n\n---\nThis session introduces a new approach to video search, enabling users to query video content using natural language, much like querying a database.

For many who are not AI practitioners, the release of ChatGPT in 2022 was their first contact with modern AI technology. This led to a flurry of funding and excitement around how AI might improve their bottom line. Two years on, the novelty of AI has worn off for many companies but remains a strategic initiative. This strategic nuance has led to two patterns that suggest a maturation of the AI conversation across industries. First, conversations seem to be pivoting from \"Are we doing [the shiny new thing]\" to serious analysis of the ROI from things built. This reframe places less emphasis on simply adopting new technologies for the sake of doing so and more emphasis on the optimal stack to maximize return relative to cost. Second, conversations are shifting to emphasize market differentiation. That is, anyone can build products that wrap around LLMs. In competitive markets, creating products and functionality that all your competitors can also build is a poor business strategy (unless having a particular thing is industry standard). Creating a competitive advantage requires companies to think strategically about their unique data assets and what they can build that their competitors cannot. // Bio</p><p>Dr. David Cox can formally lay claim to being a bioethicist (master's degree), a board-certified behavior analyst at the doctoral level, a behavioral economist (post-doc training), and a full-stack data scientist (post-doc training).

He explores AI’s role in job interviews, personalized AI assistants, and the evolving nature of human-computer interaction. Key topics include AI-driven self-analysis, context-aware AI systems, and the impact of AI on optimizing human decision-making. The conversation highlights how AI can enhance creativity, collaboration, and efficiency by reducing cognitive load and making intelligent suggestions in real time.</p><p>Fausto Albers is a relentless explorer of the unconventional—a techno-optimist with a foundation in sociology and behavioral economics, always connecting seemingly absurd ideas that, upon closer inspection, turn out to be the missing pieces of a bigger puzzle. He thrives in paradox: he overcomplicates the simple, oversimplifies the complex, and yet somehow lands on solutions that feel inevitable in hindsight. He believes that true innovation exists in the tension between chaos and structure—too much of either, and you’re stuck.His career has been anything but linear. He’s owned and operated successful restaurants, served high-stakes cocktails while juggling bottles on London’s bar tops, and later traded spirits for code—designing digital waiters, recommender systems, and AI-driven accounting tools. Now, he leads the AI Builders Club Amsterdam, a fast-growing community where AI engineers, researchers, and founders push the boundaries of intelligent systems.Ask him about RAG, and he’ll insist on specificity—because, as he puts it, discussing retrieval-augmented generation without clear definitions is as useful as declaring that “AI will have an impact on the world.” An engaging communicator, a sharp systems thinker, and a builder of both technology and communities, Fausto is here to challenge perspectives, deconstruct assumptions, and remix the future of AI.</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExploreJoin our slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkmConnect with Fausto on LinkedIn: /stepintoliquid</p>","contentLength":2670,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100581945/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-2-30%2F397495029-44100-2-8b49fc83623da.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Joe Rogan Experience #2297 - Francis Foster & Konstantin Kisin","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMsJHjtS5Do","date":1743267638,"author":"PowerfulJRE","guid":568,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Francis Foster is a writer and stand-up comic.
