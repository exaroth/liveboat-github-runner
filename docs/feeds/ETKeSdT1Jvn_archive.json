However, these models remain susceptible to significant security and safety vulnerabilities. Such weaknesses can enable attackers to jailbreak systems, allowing them to perform harmful tasks or leak sensitive information. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical applications like autonomous robotics and healthcare, the importance of ensuring AI safety is growing. Understanding the vulnerabilities in today’s AI systems is crucial to addressing these concerns.\n\n// Bio\nVinu Sankar Sadasivan is a final-year Computer Science PhD candidate at The University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi. His research focuses on Security and Privacy in AI, with a particular emphasis on AI robustness, detectability, and user privacy. Currently, Vinu is a full-time Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, working on jailbreaking multimodal AI models. Previously, Vinu was a Research Scientist intern at Meta FAIR in Paris, where he worked on AI watermarking.\n\nVinu is a recipient of the 2023 Kulkarni Fellowship and has earned several distinctions, including the prestigious Director’s Silver Medal. He completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar in 2020. Prior to their PhD, Vinu gained research experience as a Junior Research Fellow in the Data Science Lab at IIT Gandhinagar and through internships at Caltech, Microsoft Research India, and IISc.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: https://vinusankars.github.io/\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Richard on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinusankars/\n\n</p>","contentLength":2396,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98160978/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-7%2F394458992-44100-2-ab419176af6b.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nostradamus","url":"https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/nostradamus","date":1738888200,"author":"","guid":644,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For centuries, Nostradamus has been hailed as the man who saw the future—his cryptic quatrains allegedly foretelling everything from the French Revolution and the rise of Hitler to the 9/11 attacks and the Covid-19 pandemic.

Dr. Cloete explains their advanced sensor setup and the challenges of training AI in this niche field, leading to the creation of AeroSynth, a synthetic data tool.\n\nHe also discusses his collaboration with the Minor Planet Center on using AI to classify interstellar objects and upcoming telescope data. Additionally, he introduces Seeker Robotics, applying similar AI techniques to oceanic research with unmanned vehicles for marine monitoring. The conversation explores AI’s role in advancing our understanding of space and the ocean.\n\n// Bio\nRichard is a computer scientist and Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard University. As a member of the Galileo Project under Professor Avi Loeb's supervision, he develops AI models for detecting and tracking aerial objects, specializing in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). \n\nBeyond UAP research, he collaborates with astronomers at the Minor Planet Center to create AI models for identifying potential interstellar objects using the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. \n\nRichard is also the CEO and co-founder of SEAQR Robotics, a startup developing advanced unmanned surface vehicles to accelerate the discovery of novel life and phenomena in Earth's oceans and atmosphere. \n\nBefore joining Harvard, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge, UK, where his research explored the intersection of emerging technologies and law.Grew up in Cape Town, South Africa, where I used to build Tesla Coils, plasma globes, radio stethoscopes, microwave guns, AM radios, and bombs...\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: www.seaqr.net\nhttps://itc.cfa.harvard.edu/people/richard-cloete\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Richard on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-cloete/\n\n</p>","contentLength":2869,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98015716/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-4%2F394277793-44100-2-45d73bbd25586.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Chris Evans - Neuroscience and Philosophy","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOqOj9qDcwI","date":1738684840,"author":"Closer To Truth","guid":596,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Register for a Closer To Truth membership to receive special exclusives like early access to new episodes and more: https://closertotruth.com/.\n\n‘Neurophilosophy’ is the view that all that is mental or mind or consciousness can be solved ultimately by neuroscience. ‘Neuromania’ is the view that trying to explain consciousness by physical processes alone is impossible (if not ridiculous).

We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. \n\nWe’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.\n\n// Bio\nTomaz Levak, founder of OriginTrail, is active at the intersection of Cryptocurrency, the Internet, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the core of OriginTrail is a pursuit of Verifiable Internet for AI, an inclusive framework addressing critical challenges of the world in an AI era. To achieve the goal of Verifiable Internet for AI, OriginTrail's trusted knowledge foundation ensures the provenance and verifiability of information while incentivizing the creation of high-quality knowledge. These advancements are pivotal to unlock the full potential of AI as they minimize the technology’s shortfalls such as hallucinations, bias, issues of data ownership, and model collapse.\n\nTomaz's contributions to OriginTrail span over a decade and across multiple fields. He is involved in strategic technical innovations for OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and NeuroWeb blockchain and was among the authors of all three foundational White Paper documents that defined how OriginTrail technology addresses global challenges. Tomaz contributed to the design of OriginTrail token economies and is driving adoption with global brands such as British Standards Institution, Swiss Federal Railways and World Federation of Haemophilia, among others.\n\nCommitted to the ongoing expansion of the OriginTrail ecosystem, Tomaz is a regular speaker at key industry events. In his appearances, he highlights the significant value that the OriginTrail DKG brings to diverse sectors, including supply chains, life sciences, healthcare, and scientific research. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, Tomaz and the OriginTrail ecosystem as a whole are playing an important role in ensuring a more inclusive, transparent and decentralized AI.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://origintrail.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://origintrail.io</a></p>","contentLength":3065,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/97410634/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-0-22%2F393522714-44100-2-c347ea83225bc.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Fallthrough & Friends (Friends)","url":"https://changelog.com/friends/77","date":1737727200,"author":"","guid":151,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Kris Brandow &amp; Matthew Sanabria from <a href=\"https://fallthrough.fm\">Fallthrough.fm</a> join Jerod to discuss tools we’re switching to, whether or not Go is still a great systems programming language choice, user-centric documentation, the need for archivists &amp; more.</p><p><a href=\"https://changelog.com/++\" rel=\"payment\">Changelog++</a> members save 7 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.
