But the metaphor is more\n  about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often\n  sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us\n  that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural\n  patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible\n  to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do\n  things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for\n  The Forest to submit to desertification.) </p><p>In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks\n  to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert\n  Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more\n  plentiful.</p><div><p>Kent Beck supplied the image, which he may have painstakingly drew pixel by\n    pixel.
