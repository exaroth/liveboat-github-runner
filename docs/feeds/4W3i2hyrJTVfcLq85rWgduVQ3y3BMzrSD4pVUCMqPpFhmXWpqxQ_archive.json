Amazon accounts for <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/online-book-sales/5100/\" data-t-l=\":b|z|k|${u}\">more than 80% of all online book sales</a>, according to market research firm IBISWorld. Not to mention it owns Kindle, a wildly popular format for e-reading.</p><p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/\" data-t-l=\":b|z|k|${u}\">Bookshop.org</a> is ready to change that. Today, the online platform that connects readers to local bookstores launched an e-reading platform of its own. For the first time, local <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/booklist/independent-bookstores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-t-l=\":b|e|k|${u}\">independent bookstores</a> can sell e-books to customers, says CEO and founder Andy Hunter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bookshop.org launches e-book platform to support local bookstores</h2><p>Hunter is in the business of solving logistical problems for readers. In 2020, he launched <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-t-l=\":b|z|k|${u}\">Bookshop.org</a> to support local businesses losing sales to Amazon Books. Years later, as an e-reader himself, he realized how hard it was to continue his “socially-conscious consumerism” mindset of buying locally when it came to digital titles.</p><p>“Right now, no matter how much you love your local bookstore, if you want to read an e-book, you have to go to Amazon or another alternate platform and you can’t support your local bookstore,” Hunter tells USA TODAY. “E-books are an important revenue stream for publishers and authors and they could be for independent bookstores.”</p><p>The result is an app (<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/info/ebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-t-l=\":b|z|k|${u}\">available for iOS and Android,</a> and accessible from a web browser) with nearly a million titles from major publishing houses. Readers can annotate, add notes, look up words and sync across all their devices. There's a search function if consumers know the book they want to read, and if they don't, there's an explore page with suggestions by genre.</p><p>Most importantly for Hunter, booksellers will take home the profits, which he says has prevented local businesses from thriving in e-book sales until now.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s no real way to make it profitable, but we don’t care about it being profitable,” Hunter says, citing the socially conscious company’s B corporation status. “Our mission is to help independent bookstores survive and thrive in the digital age.”</p><p>With discounts, quick shipping and Kindle synching, Amazon Books has long been an appealing option to many readers. But now, Hunter says there’s “no reason on Earth to give a billionaire your $9.99 for your e-book,” as publishers set a fixed price for e-books and there’s no shipping to compete with.&nbsp;</p><p>Bookshop.org’s new initiative follows a growing movement across social media – not just exclusively in bookish communities – to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/10/washington-post-bezos-amazon-prime-cancel/680421/\" data-t-l=\":b|z|k|${u}\">forgo Amazon and other big-box sellers</a> in favor of shopping locally.&nbsp;</p><p>“In an age of billionaires and giant e-commerce companies and our loss of control of our lives to Silicon Valley <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/15/oligarchy-meaning-biden-farewell-address/77731224007/\" data-t-l=\":b|e|k|${u}\">oligarchs</a>, that they know we’re going to fight back against that and we’re going to stay local,” Hunter says. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We can invest in, we can support our local community even when we’re reading digital books.”</p><h2>E-reader features to include social sharing</h2><p>Bookshop.org's platform also includes a “quote-sharing” feature for social media, Hunter says. He wants books to catch up to the way other media is shared – it’s easy to share your Spotify or Apple Music listening to your Instagram story, and you can even post about your workouts with some apps. But if you want to share a quote from a book, readers have to take a photo of the physical book or a screenshot.&nbsp;</p><p>“They should be able to share that to social media and somebody else should be able to click in, buy the book using Apple Pay and start reading it right away,” Hunter says. “That’ll fuel all kinds of discussions about books on TikTok and places like that, and all of that will benefit the independent bookstores because it will be them selling the books that people are talking about.”</p><h2>Looking for your next great read?

Custom Firmware now allows the Playstation Portable to connect to WPA2 encrypted Wifi networks. This is thanks to the recently released  plugin, created by developer  and published on the PSP Homebrew discord.</p><h2>Playstation Portable gets WPA2 Wifi access</h2><p>The PSP has been out of official support from Sony for years, but lots of enthusiasts keep maintaining this great handheld through homebrew and custom Firmware updates. As technology evolves around us, older devices such as the PlayStation Portable can lose some of their features.</p><p>For example, as WPA2 has become the defacto encryption standard for home wifi networks (WPA3’s adoption rate remains low), older devices such as the PSP, that do not support these new* encryption standards become technically unable to access the internet.</p><p>Wifi access was a very strong feature of the PSP when it was released, and, although it’s probably less important nowadays, losing that feature because newer networks aren’t compatible is a bummer.</p><p>WPA2 support has been a request by many enthusiasts for years on PSP discussion channels, and it seems that the wpa2psp plugin by developer Moment now brings this to life. According to Acid_Snake, the developer was kind enough to provide the source code of the plugin, which allowed the ARK team to embed it into the ARK Custom Firmware for PSP.</p><div><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-49720\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wololo.net/wagic/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/moment_wpa2psp_release.png?resize=1024%2C321&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wololo.net/wagic/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/moment_wpa2psp_release.png?resize=1024%2C321&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wololo.net/wagic/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/moment_wpa2psp_release.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wololo.net/wagic/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/moment_wpa2psp_release.png?resize=768%2C241&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wololo.net/wagic/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/moment_wpa2psp_release.png?w=1124&amp;ssl=1 1124w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></div><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/psphacks/comments/1iimnft/wpa2_now_works_on_psp_thanks_to_a_new_plugin/\">This reddit thread</a> by Nebula_NL covers a lot of details on how to install and use the plugin.

He turns them back on themselves, writing rules to tell Cursor how to organize the rules, and then teach Cursor how to write (under human supervision) its own rules.</p><p>Cursor kept trying to get Huntley to use Bazel as a build system. So he had cursor write a rule for itself: “no bazel”. And there was no more Bazel. If I’d known I could do this, I probably wouldn’t have bounced from the Elixir project I had Cursor doing, where trying to get it to write simple unit tests got it all tangled up trying to make <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html\" title=\"\">Mox</a> work. </p><p>But I’m burying the lead. </p><p>Security people have been for several years now somewhat in love with a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep\" title=\"\">Semgrep</a>. Semgrep is a semantics-aware code search tool; using symbolic variable placeholders and otherwise ordinary code, you can write rules to match pretty much arbitary expressions and control flow. </p><p>If you’re an appsec person, where you obviously go with this is: you build a library of Semgrep searches for well-known vulnerability patterns (or, if you’re like us at Fly.io, you work out how to get Semgrep to catch the Rust concurrency footgun of RWLocks inside if-lets).</p><p>The reality for most teams though is “ain’t nobody got time for that”. </p><p>But I just checked and, unsurprisingly, 4o <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa94a7-ea3c-8012-845c-6c9491b33fe4\" title=\"\">seems to do reasonably well</a> at generating Semgrep rules? Like: I have no idea if this rule is actually any good. But it looks like a Semgrep rule?</p><p>What interests me is this: it seems obvious that we’re going to do more and more “closed-loop” LLM agent code generation stuff. By “closed loop”, I mean that the thingy that generates code is going to get to run the code and watch what happens when it’s interacted with. You’re just a small bit of glue code and a lot of system prompting away from building something like that right now: <a href=\"https://x.com/chris_mccord/status/1882839014845374683\" title=\"\">Chris McCord is building</a> a thingy that generates whole Elixir/Phoenix apps and runs them as Fly Machines. When you deploy these kinds of things, the LLM gets to see the errors when the code is run, and it can just go fix them. It also gets to see errors and exceptions in the logs when you hit a page on the app, and it can just go fix them.</p><p>With a bit more system prompting, you can get an LLM to try to generalize out from exceptions it fixes and generate unit test coverage for them. </p><p>With a little bit more system prompting, you can probably get an LLM to (1) generate a Semgrep rule for the generalized bug it caught, (2) test the Semgrep rule with a positive/negative control, (3) save the rule, (4) test the whole codebase with Semgrep for that rule, and (5) fix anything it finds that way. </p><p>That is a lot more interesting to me than tediously (and probably badly) trying to predict everything that will go wrong in my codebase a priori and Semgrepping for them. Which is to say: Semgrep — which I have always liked — is maybe a lot more interesting now?

They were turned upside down, each with a hole drilled through the middle of the base, rendering them useless in terms of a cup's normal, and really only, task.</p><p>The couple's future hinged on accomplishing what the world's second largest toy company could not: convincing thousands of kids that stacking these plastic cups in pre-determined patterns was … . More critically, the couple needed to convince the parents of those kids to actually buy these cups, despite not even being able to drink from them.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Takiguchi could breathe a sigh of relief.

It has appeared on pretty much every morning and late show, been a trend piece in both the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/sport-stacking-speed-cups.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124044351073445491\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>, and was once labeled by Glenn Beck as \"<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/story/glenn-beck-why-health-care-reform-is-like-cup-stacking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">what’s really wrong with America</a>.\"</p><p>It has been a minor plot line in , Matt LeBlanc's , and ; it's been the major plot line in a 2022 Thai-language film released on Netflix titled <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18357588/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a> (100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes). The infamous \"Oh my gosh!\" scream in Skrillex's \"Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\" was sampled from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j54yGxuk0yo&amp;t=1s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viral sport stacking video</a> from 2008.</p><p>At its peak, between 2002 and 2011, roughly 5,000 American schools included it as part of their annual curriculum, according to Mr. and Mrs. Fox. That means somewhere between five and eight percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 22 and 35 share the same core memory—and in the ensuing years have asked themselves, their friends, or social media the same question: <em>Why did credentialed educational professionals make us do this ludicrous activity in gym class?</em></p><p>I am, perhaps, the person best suited on the planet to answer this question.&nbsp;Because the answer … is my dad.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about Bob Fox is that he used to be a clown. Not in the figurative, funnyman personality sense. In the literal red-nose, black-eyeliner, juggling-tennis-balls-at-children’s-birthday-parties sense.</p><p>The second thing you need to know about my dad is that he was a <em>really, really good clown</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>He'd scoff at the mental image you probably have of him right now: oversized shoes, cartoonish honks, and bumbling choreography. My dad's act was entirely silent, required immense skill, and was predicated on audience participation. He was equally good at riding a unicycle and convincing the most curmudgeonly dad in the room to leave their back corner and join him onstage to try—and always fail—at blowing up a balloon animal. Kids went bananas. Adults always laughed.&nbsp;</p><p>The San Francisco 49ers hired him to be the walk-around entertainment for their post–Super Bowl ring ceremony in 1995. We used to shut the shades so neighbors didn't think he robbed a bank as he counted the cash he earned during Denver's largest busking festival.</p><p>This was a man who took the unserious very, very seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>As a high school theater teacher, he'd spend 60–80 hours a week building out increasingly elaborate sets for the annual musical. He built a life-sized plant puppet that could actually eat cast members for , and cut a full-sized muscle car in half so it would fit on stage during ; another car was hoisted onto the school's roof to promote the show. Before her bevy of Oscar nominations, Amy Adams was one of his choreographers and students.</p><p>He quit because his wife, Jill, needed him home more to help raise their three children. So he became an elementary school classroom and PE teacher instead, where he would end up teaching hundreds of kids how to ride unicycles and produce an annual show on the blacktop basketball court called KidZircus.</p><p>The first thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that before working as a communications administrator at a school district, she used to be a journalist at a small newspaper, where she was assigned to write a profile about a local clown on \"sabbatical\" from his full-time job.&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing you need to know about Jill Fox is that despite the word \"sabbatical\" doing a generous amount of euphemistic work in her final published piece, she married that unemployed clown.</p><p>This was a woman who was very, very good at seeing—and supporting—the potential in the crazy.</p><div><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: Uncle Johnny.</em></strong></p></blockquote></div></div><p>It took them 10 months to sell the 10,000 sets of 12 cups.&nbsp;</p><p>Kids in south Denver, it turns out, went absolutely nuts over this new phenomenon called \"cup stacking.\" That's mostly because my dad figured out the one thing Hasbro did not: The level of interest in the activity hinged almost exclusively on the enthusiasm and skill level of a real-life teacher. Without that, it was just inanimate plastic ephemera sitting on a shelf.</p><p>The basic rules take about 15 minutes to learn. Like a track meet, the sport is built on completing different \"distances\" as fast as you can. The shortest, and simplest, is called the 3-3-3. Envision each one of those 3's as a nested column of cups. You start on one side and \"upstack\" the first 3 into a pyramid, then move to the middle, and then the last 3. Then you return to where you started, and \"downstack\" them back into columns in the same order. The 3-6-3 has the same principle, but with a pyramid of six cups in the middle. The \"Cycle,\" is the sport's primetime event, starting with the 3-6-3, morphing into a 6-6, and ending with a 1-10-1.</p><p>If you skimmed over that clunky paragraph, you've proved my dad's foundational epiphany: You really need to see it to buy in. In fact, scrap reading this for a few seconds (that's all it will take) and watch this video instead.</p><p>Place a set of these cups in the corner of a room or on a toy shelf with paper instructions, and you might earn five minutes of an 8-year-old's frenzied attention. Put that same 8-year-old on the gym floor in front of a professionally trained clown with a passion for juggling, and they will be utterly hooked.</p><p>A brief digression on nomenclature: The sport was known as \"cup stacking\" until 2005, when my parents had the savvy to officially change the name to \"sport stacking.\" Why? 1) Because it sounds way cooler, and if enough people call it a sport then it must damn well be one. 2) The phrase \"cup stacking\" out of context evokes toddlers playing with blocks, a vibe they wanted to avoid. Confusingly, you might have also seen it referenced as \"speed stacking,\" after the company they eventually founded, Speed Stacks. They strategically eschewed this label to avoid the fate of Roller Blades, Frisbee, and Kleenex, all formerly good standing trademarks, until you lot ruined everything. </p><p>Except for this early-stage reference, I'll be calling it sport stacking hereafter so as to avoid a grumpy phone call from my dad (he'll probably still call about my use of \"damn,\" though). If you have a problem with that, consider the last time you went berserk over a nine-darter or screamed at the Swedish curling team during the Olympics. As my dad likes to say, there used to be a man trying to convince the world that tossing balls made from dried cow skin into retrofitted peach baskets was fun—and you all bought in.</p><p>It is important to note that my dad did not actually invent sport stacking. Credit goes to a group of bored kids at a Boys and Girls Club in Oceanside, Calif., in the early 1980s. They'd been given a stack of paper cups, and told to figure out a game that didn't involve messy liquid. Under the guidance of a program director named Wayne Godinet, both the rules and equipment evolved. He is responsible for the sport's first major innovation: He drilled a hole through the base of hard plastic cups to reduce air friction and prevent sticking. The California group's high-water mark came on Nov. 2, 1990, when they appeared on <em>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</em>. Among the millions watching that night, from his bed in a south Denver suburb: a clown and future PE teacher who thought it looked a bit like upside-down juggling.</p><p>Hasbro must have been watching, too. Perhaps chasing the Hoola Hoop and Pogs high of the '80s, the company scooped up a license to sell \"Kup Stax,\" popping sets in a rectangular plastic sleeve on toy store shelves around the world. Instead of becoming a fad, the product moved to the clearance rack. Someone in middle management was probably scolded. Manufacturing ceased.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, my dad attended a physical education development workshop to give new teachers a dozen ideas on how to keep kids occupied, exercised, and docile. The classics were all there: four-wheeled square scooters designed to give 80 percent of users elbow burn, dodgeballs primed to pop kids like me in the face, that large circus tent you toss above your head until it temporarily inflates so you can sit under it for a few seconds. So were the cups.&nbsp;</p><p>He brought them home and taught his kids. I was 4, my brother 6, our sister 9. We not only fell in love with them, we got good—. We weren't outliers. Among an elementary school of 500 students, 250 signed up for an afterschool program to keep stacking. My mom drove to every Toys \"R\" Us and Walmart within a 50-mile radius. She bought every set of Kup Stax she could find. They were always discounted, tucked in a back corner.</p><p>The local supply ran dry as my parents hosted workshops. Demand started to skyrocket from other PE teachers. My parents needed to go upstream. They had to figure out how to tap into the supply chain of global toy conglomerates. Fortunately, they had a guy: .</p><p>Now 64 with a Colonel Sanders goatee and passion for intricate leather carving, my dad's brother has been at certain points in his life: a professor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College; a street mime in San Diego; a director of&nbsp;a Las Vegas magic show, performed entirely on ice; and a consultant for Japan's oldest and largest circus. If you need to find a man in middle management at Hasbro's Tokyo corporate office, you call Uncle Johnny.</p><p>The deal was struck. The shipment arrived. And the cups, rather magically, disappeared from our basement.</p><p>By 1998, Bob Fox was a dealer with no product and an increasingly addicted customer base. There was only one logical next step: Transition from distribution to fabrication.</p><p>He did make a final good-faith effort to partner with the sport's originator, Wayne Godinet, offering to purchase $20,000 worth of product. It was almost a third of the profit earned from reselling the Japanese shipment. Godinet sent back two sample sets with a bill for the cost of goods and shipping.</p><p>In a similar vein, Nike was founded in 1964 only after a running shoe company called Onitsuka lost interest in partnering with a recent Oregon track grad named Phil Knight. While his shoe empire was born between the grooves of a waffle iron, Bob and Jill's cup empire was sketched on the back of a Fresh Fish Co. paper placemat.</p><p>Speed Stacks LLC was incorporated in December 1998. My parents quit their full-time public school jobs in June 2000.&nbsp;</p><p>This was to be an official test of a core tenet of the American Dream: With enough passion and even more prodigious work ethic, you can turn a ludicrous idea into a successful business. To get started, they just needed four things.</p><p>First: a mold to mass produce the cups. It required $20,000 and overcoming the absolute befuddlement of executives at a Denver plastics manufacturer who did not understand the  to include three small holes at the base. As each cup came off the line, our family would inspect the shape; minor defects in its roundness caused sticking. Nearly every cup in the first run had to be tossed out for deformities.</p><p>Second: a nylon and mesh cup-carrying bag. Those were sewn in the back basement of a Vietnamese immigrant–owned textile company. We bagged each set of 12 by hand, my parents staying up until 2:00 in the morning to fulfill orders after working full school days. Bob wasn't satisfied unless the logo of every cup perfectly faced forward.</p><p>Third: to hit the road. Speed Stack's first tagline was \"See it! Believe it! Teach it!\" My parents meant it: They knew that success was linearly related to the number of PE teachers who witnessed the sport in person. Our family of five put almost 100,000 miles on our 1997 maroon Suburban in a little over four years.</p><p>Fourth: kids who could stack the cups. . For some reason, all three of the Fox progeny developed both the interest and intrinsic skill to do just that.</p><div><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door.&nbsp;</em></strong></p></blockquote></div></div><p>Legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer’s voice was always our music cue. <em>\"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event!\"</em></p><p>It would blast over portable speakers on either side of a gym floor. Emmy, my older sister, would lead us out from a hidden corner, followed by my brother, Brennan, then me: a 7-year-old with Coke-bottle glasses, immensely satisfied by the fact that hundreds of eyes were watching my every move.</p><p>We stopped when we reached separate tables spread evenly across our makeshift stage, usually under the basketball hoop. We stood still to let the tempo build.&nbsp;</p><p><em>\"Let’s get ready to rumble!\"</em></p><p>The synths would drop, and we would commence stacking plastic cups. Faster and with more skill than the students and teachers in Amarillo or Ft. Lauderdale or Butzbach, Germany, or Copenhagen, Denmark, could ever think possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Our family performed hundreds of school assemblies in almost every corner of the country (and some overseas). The 30-minute spectacle was choreographed specifically to blow the minds of kids between the ages of 7 and 14 as quickly as possible. This wasn't a talk from your fire chief about safety, or puppets teaching you the value of sharing. We humiliated principals and popular teachers by making them race us. There was a fabricated jacket with holes cut in the back that we fitted onto a volunteer, then stuck our arms through the sleeves to make it appear like they were magically adept (performed to the  soundtrack). The finale was a choreographed stacking routine, set to \"Dueling Banjos\" from .</p><p>But a school-by-school roadshow wasn't a scalable business model. So we went to the nexus of physical education sweatsuitdom: state and national teacher conventions. At a booth in hotel conference halls and city convention centers, we'd stack for hours, drawing crowds spread three and four rows deep, often to the annoyance of the dodgeball or shuttlecock purveyors next door.&nbsp;</p><p>It's most likely that you learned how to sport stack because your teacher, with a lanyard badge bouncing over her multi-colored windbreaker on her way to get a free muffin from the guys who sell tug-o-war ropes, stopped in her tracks in the back corner of Exhibit Hall B at an exurban Renaissance hotel. She would watch as our hands manipulated dishware so fast it blurred.</p><p>If my dad was adept at putting on a good show, my mom was equally adept at corralling the press. Her journalism and PR–honed chops put sport stacking in front of millions, from the D-block of local newscasts to 30 Rock Plaza during the .&nbsp;</p><p>That's how I found myself chatting with a shirtless Simon Cowell in the makeup room before we both appeared on Ellen DeGeneres's show, taught Tiki Barber the basics of the 3-3-3, and tried to convince a baffled Michael Caine in the green room of <em>LIVE with Regis and Kelly</em> that yes, indeed, kids really do stack plastic cups for fun.</p><p>All press, to my parents, was good. My dad was absolutely thrilled when Glenn Beck spent four minutes of his daily Fox News monologue staring directly into the camera, railing against the dangers of stacking cups.</p><p>\"We can't fix our country by keeping our children weak,\" Beck sputtered, roughly two minutes in. \"They need to have spines. They need to get hit in the face a few times with a ball, you know what I mean? They have to learn how to live with and thrive on past failures.\"</p><p>Brands soon took advantage of sport stacking's essential power: No matter the context, it attracts near-instant attention. In 2005, I appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxwybLaGciSxQJgS1FKh-3PeJwa9xtXtN8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nationwide Comcast commercial</a> for high speed internet. FritoLay shut down part of Times Square to feature our stacking talents as it launched Stax, a competitor to Pringles. A beverage company in England flew a dozen of us to London to help launch an abomination of a drink called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eelE8tHEScM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Freekee Soda</a>. Main ingredient? Carbonated milk. (Did I pretend to enjoy drinking that carbonated milk so as to not piss off any of the execs helping to pay for my college education? Obviously. But it is a cursed flavor.)</p><p>Perhaps the only media my parents turned down was an appearance on the infamous reality show . The producers, naturally, presumed the scions of a ludicrous gym activity would have some weird baggage to mine for the masses.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the cups, we were pretty normal.</p><div><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos.</em></strong></p></blockquote></div></div><p>It was the Germans who made everything more serious.</p><p>They arrived at the 2004 World Sport Stacking Championships in matching flag-inspired sweatsuits. Multiple coaches would analyze everything from hand-tag efficiency during the four-person relay event to the mental routines of stackers before their individual competition.</p><p>Sport stacking, I believe, grew into a minor phenomenon for three reasons: 1) It's visually arresting, 2) it's easy to learn, and 3) competing against the clock is incredibly addicting.</p><p>Media buzz and schoolteachers kindled the first two. But my dad's magnum opus—the reason the sport didn't wither in the way of skip ball and snake boards—was that he (with the help of the 20 employees at the burgeoning HQ) built the infrastructure and equipment to spur global competition.&nbsp;</p><p>The sport's growth coincided with two of my dad's innovations: the StackMat, a patented self-timing device that allowed kids to practice on their own for hours, aiming to trim hundredths of a second off their best times; and the World Sport Stacking Association, a governing body to codify the rules and serve as the keeper of world, national, and local records.</p><p>In 1997, 250 kids were hand-timed with stop watches at the first Colorado State Championship.&nbsp;By 2007, ESPN aired an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EKnl4ZDQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hourlong David Lloyd–hosted special</a> of the World Championships, featuring more than 1,000 competitors from seven countries (re-aired in 2020 during their pandemic \"The Ocho\" promotion).&nbsp;</p><p>Like everything in his life, my dad choreographed a spectacle. He ordered a three-story banner to hang behind garbage can–sized cups that served as center stage. The competition floor was arranged with dozens of tables, all marked with laser-lined tape to demarcate relay boundaries.</p><p>During the final \"Stack of Champions,\" the top competitors (and relay teams) from each event competed under the scrutiny of spotlights, three officials, an instant replay camera, and hundreds of spectators. In individual events, you're allotted two warmups and three tries. Relays are conducted head-to-head in teams of four.</p><p>For a few years, I was among those finalists.&nbsp;</p><p>To stack as fast as you possibly can in a World Championship is to strike a balance between fluidity and chaos. Push too hard and the cups tumble. Pull back and you'll lose by thousandths of a second.</p><div><div><figure><figcaption>A relay race in the Stack of Champions, in which I (the third stacker on the left team) stumble at the start, allowing my brother (the last stacker on the right team) to beat us by two-hundredths of a second.</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>For those moments, you exist at the outer physical boundary of human biology. When performing at your peak, the cups feel less like they're being stacked and more like they're being sprayed.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2001, the world record for sport stacking's marquee event, the Cycle, was 7.43 seconds. It was held by my sister. At the time, most people assumed a sub-seven-second time was physically impossible. The pattern requires more than 40 separate moves. At those speeds, hands make micro-adjustments faster than the brain can register. Her time stood for nearly four years.</p><p>In 2025, the world record for the cycle is 4.739 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>Please understand: I know this whole endeavor is silly, that it's worthy of your slight mockery and general patina of confusion. But also understand that my dad created a culture in which German coaches passed strategic tips to Australian competitors. Where Japanese teenagers became pen pals with suburban Texans. Where nerves collapsed faster than the cups. Where kids and adults shrieked with joy over millisecond improvements. Where tension and drama and friendship mingled with the clattering cacophony of sliding and tapping plastic (there really is no sound like the one at these competitions).&nbsp;</p><p>Sport stacking had broad exposure in both mainstream and weird places. But it had a deep impact in a much smaller community. It changed lives.</p><div><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>You've probably heard Rachael’s voice.

That's the only way I know how to describe her,\" Ferguson, now a 23-year-old co-founder of an independent animation studio, said. Their teacher loved competition and was beloved by her students, exactly the archetype to stop at a conference booth and believe in a quirky new cup-centric educational trend.</p><p>Rachael Nedrow, now a 29-year-old product manager at Amazon, first saw the sport while scrolling YouTube when she was 11. She pulled paper cups from the kitchen drawer to try and mimic the movement.</p><p>Both became obsessed, quickly. Though for different reasons.</p><p>\"I was never the fastest kid. I was always kind of chubby. I was much more the creative person than an athletic one,\" Ferguson said. \"Sport stacking was about hand-eye coordination more than strength. It was intricate. Delicate.\" For the first time, they were excited to attend PE class.</p><p>Nedrow, an accomplished tennis player, was intrigued by the self-improvement and rigid strictures of the clock. She bought an official set of Speed Stacks and started logging her progress on her own YouTube channel.</p><p>\"My first competition was at a local church,\" Nedrow said. \"I did terribly, but I still won.\"</p><p>Despite differing motivations, Ferguson and Nedrow's paths to competitive sport stacking mirror each other. Friends weren't interested, so they went looking for a community online and at competitions.&nbsp;</p><p>For the thousand kids that congregated on the arena floor at each World Championships, like Ferguson and Nedrow, the sentiment was common. They had found  people. They fit in, sometimes for the first time in their life.&nbsp;</p><p>There were future college athletes and kids with autism. There were rugby fans from New Zealand (riffing off their national team, they called themselves the \"All Stacks\") and South Koreans who had never been to the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Roll your eyes, but my dad loved to say that the sport only helped build \"positive pyramids.\" Spend a few hours watching kids pat each other on the back after a fumbled cup, or earn a hug for achieving a new personal best, and you'd buy into the platitude too.</p><p>Compared to other top-level stackers, Nedrow and Ferguson's experiences only differ in one way.&nbsp;</p><p>You've probably heard Rachael's voice. Her effusive reaction on a stacking YouTube video meant for her small group of friends is behind the iconic \"YES, OH MY GOSH!\" scream, sampled in one of EDM's most mainstream hits, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites</a>,\" by Skrillex. Between Spotify and YouTube, it has more than 500 million streams.</p><p>And you probably know Ferguson's dad, Craig, the comedian and host of <em>The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson</em> from 2005 to 2014.</p><p>Nedrow's collision with virality gave her backstage passes to several Skrillex concerts and the greatest fodder for \"Two Truths and a Lie\" of all time. But sport stacking also gave her something else she wasn’t expecting: a wide group of online friends.</p><p>\"I don't think I would have taken stacking so far if it wasn't for the online community,\" Nedrow said. \"When you are doing anything kind of competitive, it seems like it's much better when you are doing it with people. I really loved the aspect of kids commenting on my videos, saying they started stacking because of me. What greater pleasure can you get than inspiring other people to do what you love the most?\"</p><p>Sport stacking gave Ferguson inclusion and validation. But perhaps more important than what it gave them is what it gave their parents. While Craig and his ex-wife Sascha had been separated for a few years by the time their kid started competing, both fully committed to supporting this weird, wholesome obsession. Sascha helped Milo learn how to breathe and center themselves before starting to stack. And she supplied an ever-growing collection of stacking equipment, stored in a dedicated room in their Southern California home.</p><p>To see what sport stacking gave Craig, you need to watch his show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Wjk0PkpWco\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from April 20, 2009</a>. He spends four minutes—more than half of the entire monologue—bragging about Milo. Beneath the scripted jokes and of-the-era references (Octomom is mentioned twice), you see a guy just genuinely proud of his kid. He's like any neighbor, going off a bit too effusively about the weekend's peewee football game or math test.&nbsp;</p><p>Except this was done for millions. And it was about ... cups.&nbsp;</p><div><div><blockquote><p><strong><em>\"I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success.

College funds were paid through YouTube viewership revenue and small brand endorsements. Children with autism and special needs learned, practiced, competed, and socialized with others for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>For me and my siblings, it gave us a stable home, trips to a dozen countries, and some excellent college essay material. My sister, Emmy, went on to play basketball for four years at the University of Minnesota, was drafted into the WNBA by the Minnesota Lynx, and then played professionally overseas with Sheryl Swoopes. My brother Brennan played D-III college football and turned into a mechanical engineer at a global cosmetics company. I turned into a fairly unathletic writer.</p><p>For my parents, it gave them an early retirement. A sometimes-operational 1957 VW Bug and an obsession with growing ever-larger pumpkins occupied my dad, while training to run another marathon at age 70 became a focus for my mom. They left their active roles at Speed Stacks in 2015, leaving control to some of its earliest employees. Programs are still active in thousands of schools around the world.</p><p>\"I was motivated to spread sport stacking for the same reason I taught my students how to juggle or unicycle,\" my dad recalled, nearly 10 years into retirement. \"I wanted to give kids, no matter their athletic ability, the opportunity for success.

It’s a proof-of-concept that lets a large language model take charge of debugging. Instead of only looking at the static code, the LLM also gets to see the live runtime state—actual variable values, function calls, branch decisions, and more. The idea is to give it enough context to help diagnose issues faster and even generate synthetic data from running programs.</p><p>* Active Debugging: It integrates with Node.js debug sessions to gather runtime info (like variable states and stack traces).</p><p>* Automated Breakpoints: It automatically sets and manages breakpoints based on both code analysis and LLM suggestions.</p><p>* LLM Guidance: With live debugging context, the LLM can suggest actions like stepping through code or adjusting breakpoints in real time.</p><p>I built this out of curiosity to see if combining static code with runtime data could help LLMs solve bugs more effectively. It’s rough around the edges and definitely not production-ready</p><p>I’m not planning on maintaining it further. But I thought it was a fun experiment and wanted to share it with you all.</p><p>Check out the attached video demo to see it in action.
