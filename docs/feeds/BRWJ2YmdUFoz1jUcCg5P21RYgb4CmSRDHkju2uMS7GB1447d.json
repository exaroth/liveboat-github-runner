However, Python’s type annotations have changed repeatedly over the years. In&nbsp;<strong>Python Typing: Type Checking for Python Programmers</strong>, you will learn all you need to know to add type hints to your Python applications effectively.</p><p>You will also learn how to use Python type checkers, configure them, and set them up in pre-commit or GitHub Actions. This knowledge will give you the power to check your code and your team’s code automatically before merging, hopefully catching defects before they make it into your products.</p><p>You will learn all about Python’s support for type hinting (annotations). Specifically, you will learn about the following topics:</p><ul><li>Annotating Decorators and Generators</li><li>Using Mypy for type checking</li><li>Using ty for type checking</li></ul><p>There are several different rewards you can get in this Kickstarter:</p><ul><li>A signed paperback copy of the book (See Stretch Goals)</li><li>An eBook copy of the book in PDF and ePub</li><li>A t-shirt with the cover art from the book (See Stretch Goals)</li></ul>","contentLength":1045,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","python"]}
