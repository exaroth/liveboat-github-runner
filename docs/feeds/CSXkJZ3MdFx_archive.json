How do you define \"real\"? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, taste, and see... then \"real\" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.</p></blockquote><p>If the processor is the brain of the computer, could it also be part of some kind of virtual reality? Simulated memory, software-defined peripherals, artificially generated interrupts.</p><p>My first computer was a 286 with 1 MB of RAM and a 50 MB HDD (if I remember correctly). So I decided to pick up a 286 processor and try to simulate the rest of the computer around it. Or at least make it to boot up and run some simple assembly code.</p><p>Two years ago, I ordered two (that's how many came in a package) Harris 80C286-12 processors. My memories are a bit hazy, but I believe the  in its name is important because these are the types that are less sensitive to clock accuracy (the  at the end means it likes to run at 12 MHz), and can even be stepped manually.</p><p>At first, I wasn't too successful with it, and the project ended up in a drawer. Then this year, I picked it up again and tried to figure out where things went wrong.</p><p>The processor fits into a PLCC-68 socket. The pins of the socket are not suitable for plugging in jumper wires directly, so the socket was mounted onto an adapter PCB with jumper-compatible headers. The pinout of both the chip and the socket is included in <a href=\"https://deadlime.hu/uploads/2026/80C286_datasheet.pdf\">the datasheet</a>, but the adapter PCB complicates things a bit, so I created a small conversion table to make my life easier.</p><p>The table also helped identify the various inputs and outputs, which would later be useful when connecting to the Raspberry Pi. As you can see, no fewer than 57 pins are required, which is more than the Pi can provide. The MCP23S17 IO expander came to the rescue. While it wouldn't allow us to drive the processor at the breakneck speed of the supported 12 MHz, fortunately, that's not our goal.</p><p>The chip contains 16 IO pins, so we'll need four of them. Although each pin can individually be configured as input or output, I tried to group them logically. The expander has side A and side B, each with 8 pins, and the final result looked like this:</p><pre><code>         ┌───┬──┬───┐      \n         ┤   └──┘   ├      \n         ┤          ├      \n         ┤   FLAG   ├ ERROR\n         ┤          ├ BUSY \n         ┤ ADDR:100 ├ INTR \n   READY ┤          ├ NMI  \n   RESET ┤B        A├ PEREQ\n     CLK ┤          ├ HOLD \n         └──────────┘      \n         ┌───┬──┬───┐      \n    HLDA ┤   └──┘   ├ A23  \nCOD/INTA ┤          ├ A22  \n    M/IO ┤   MISC   ├ A21  \n    LOCK ┤          ├ A20  \n     BHE ┤ ADDR:011 ├ A19  \n      S1 ┤          ├ A18  \n      S0 ┤B        A├ A17  \n   PEACK ┤          ├ A16  \n         └──────────┘      \n         ┌───┬──┬───┐      \n      A8 ┤   └──┘   ├ A7   \n      A9 ┤          ├ A6   \n     A10 ┤   ADDR   ├ A5   \n     A11 ┤          ├ A4   \n     A12 ┤ ADDR:010 ├ A3   \n     A13 ┤          ├ A2   \n     A14 ┤B        A├ A1   \n     A15 ┤          ├ A0   \n         └──────────┘      \n         ┌───┬──┬───┐      \n      D8 ┤   └──┘   ├ D7   \n      D9 ┤          ├ D6   \n     D10 ┤   DATA   ├ D5   \n     D11 ┤          ├ D4   \n     D12 ┤ ADDR:001 ├ D3   \n     D13 ┤          ├ D2   \n     D14 ┤B        A├ D1   \n     D15 ┤          ├ D0   \n         └──────────┘      \n</code></pre><p>The Pi communicates with the expanders over SPI. Several solutions exist for this. I chose the one where all chips are active simultaneously, and the Pi is sending them messages by their hardware address.</p><p>The RESET pin (wired with the purple cable) does not need to be controlled by the Pi in this case, but during one of the debugging sessions, I tried it in the hopes that it would help, and it remained that way. Now we just need to connect everything with a truckload of jumper wires, and we could move on to programming.</p><p>We only need a relatively small portion of the MCP23S17’s capabilities. We just have to configure the direction of the IO pins and read/write the relevant registers. Configuration is done by modifying register values. First, we need to enable the use of hardware addressing. By default, all chips have the address , so if we send a register modification to that address (setting the  bit in the  register), hardware addressing will be enabled simultaneously on all four chips.</p><p>After a few hours (days) of head-scratching, it turned out that this alone is not necessarily sufficient for proper operation. We also need to send the same message to the configured hardware address itself to enable hardware addressing (rather odd, I know). So if, for example, we set the hardware address to , we must resend the original register modification message previously sent to  to  as well.</p><p>Now that hardware addressing is sorted out, we need to set the  and  registers of each chip to the appropriate direction. Because of our grouping, we can configure an entire side at once for reading () or writing (). Further details can be found in <a href=\"https://deadlime.hu/uploads/2026/MCP23017_datasheet.pdf\">the chip's datasheet</a>.</p><p>Originally, I started working with a Pi Zero, but eventually settled on a Pi Pico running MicroPython. To manage the expander chips, I created the following small class:</p><pre><code>\n    IODIRA = \n    IODIRB = \n    IOCON = \n    GPIOA = \n    GPIOB = \n        self.__address = address\n        self.__spi = spi\n        self.__cs = cs\n\n    \n        self.__writeRegister(, self.IOCON, )\n        self.writeRegister(self.IOCON, )\n\n    \n        self.__writeRegister(self.__address, reg, value)\n\n    \n        tx = bytearray([self.__address | , reg, ])\n        rx = bytearray()\n        self.__cs.value()\n        self.__spi.write_readinto(tx, rx)\n        self.__cs.value()\n         rx[]\n\n    \n        self.__cs.value()\n        self.__spi.write(bytes([address, reg, value]))\n        self.__cs.value()\n</code></pre><p>In , you can clearly see that we set the value of the  register twice. We can use the class as follows to communicate with the processor:</p><pre><code>spi = SPI(, baudrate=, sck=Pin(), mosi=Pin(), miso=Pin())\ncs = Pin(, mode=Pin.OUT, value=)\nrst = Pin(, mode=Pin.OUT, value=)\n\nchip_data = MCP23S17(, spi, cs)\nchip_addr = MCP23S17(, spi, cs)\nchip_misc = MCP23S17(, spi, cs)\nchip_flag = MCP23S17(, spi, cs)\n\nrst.value()\n\nchip_data.init()\nchip_addr.init()\nchip_misc.init()\nchip_flag.init()\n\nchip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\nchip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n\nchip_addr.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\nchip_addr.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n\nchip_misc.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\nchip_misc.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n\nchip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\nchip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n</code></pre><p>At first, I missed the  calls here and was surprised when nothing worked. Most of the pins are configured for reading; only the flags need to be set to writing.</p><p>Before we can do anything, we need to RESET the processor. For this, the RESET flag must be held active for at least 16 clock cycles, and switching it on and off must be synchronized with the clock flag. First, I created a few constants for the flags to make life easier:</p><pre><code>\nFLAG_ERROR = \nFLAG_BUSY  = \nFLAG_INTR  = \nFLAG_NMI   = \nFLAG_PEREQ = \nFLAG_HOLD  = \nFLAG_CLK   = \nFLAG_RESET = \nFLAG_READY = \nFLAG_PEACK    = \nFLAG_S0       = \nFLAG_S1       = \nFLAG_BHE      = \nFLAG_LOCK     = \nFLAG_M_IO     = \nFLAG_COD_INTA = \nFLAG_HLDA     = </code></pre><p>It's worth comparing this with the earlier MCP23S17 pin mapping. We treat each group of 8 pins as 8 bits / 1 byte of data. For example, in the byte from the 'misc' chip's  side, the  flag is the least significant bit, while  is the most significant.</p><pre><code>PEACK\n↓\n10100111\n       ↑\n    HLDA\n</code></pre><p>With the flags in place, we can perform the RESET:</p><pre><code> i  range():\n    chip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, FLAG_CLK | FLAG_RESET)\n    time.sleep()\n    chip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, FLAG_RESET)\n    time.sleep()\n</code></pre><p>The sleep intervals were chosen more or less arbitrarily; we don't have to adhere to any strict timing. During RESET, the processor must enter a defined state. We can verify this with the following piece of code:</p><pre><code>data = chip_addr.readRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOA)\nprint( + str(bin(data)))\ndata = chip_addr.readRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB)\nprint( + str(bin(data)))\ndata = chip_misc.readRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOA)\nprint( + str(bin(data)))\ndata = chip_misc.readRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB)\nprint( + str(bin(data)))\n</code></pre><p>The values we expect to see look like this:</p><pre><code>A7-0:   0b11111111\nA15-8:  0b11111111\nA23-16: 0b11111111\nPEACK, S0, S1, BHE, LOCK, M/IO, COD/INTA, HLDA: 0b11111000\n</code></pre><p>Strangely enough, I was greeted with the following instead:</p><pre><code>A7-0:   0b11111111\nA15-8:  0b11111000\nA23-16: 0b11111111\nPEACK, S0, S1, BHE, LOCK, M/IO, COD/INTA, HLDA: 0b11111000\n</code></pre><p>It was hard not to notice that the values in the second and fourth lines were identical. I checked all the connections, disassembled everything, debugged with LEDs to ensure the values I wrote were going to the right places, replaced the chip assigned to the A15-8 pins, swapped the processor for the spare, reread the code a thousand times, but nothing helped.</p><p>Then I found that hardware addressing trick mentioned earlier with the MCP23S17, and everything started to work like magic. The point is, if everything went well, we can release the RESET flag, and the boot process can begin.</p><pre><code>chip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, FLAG_CLK | FLAG_RESET)\ntime.sleep()\nchip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, )\ntime.sleep()\n</code></pre><p>After this, within 50 clock cycles, the processor must begin to read the first instruction to execute from address . The , , , and  flags determine what the processor intends to do.</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr></tbody></table><p>I left out the less interesting ones from the table; they can be viewed in <a href=\"https://deadlime.hu/uploads/2026/80C286_datasheet.pdf\">the datasheet</a>.

Something that requires both reading and writing memory. A simple little program that reads two numbers from memory, adds them, and writes the result back to memory.</p><p>Since we start very close to the end of memory (), we don't have much room, so first we need to jump elsewhere.</p><pre><code>[cpu ]\n:</code></pre><pre><code>[cpu ]\n  ax, ax\n ds, ax\n\n ax, [num1]\n ax, [num2]\n [result], ax\n\n    dw     dw   dw </code></pre><p>Using the  program, we can also generate a binary from it:</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>Then, with a short Python script, we can convert it into a Python-friendly format so we can load it into our virtual memory:</p><pre><code> sys\n\n open(sys.argv[], )  f:\n    data = f.read()\nhex_values = .join( byte  data)\nprint()\n</code></pre><pre><code>\n[0xea, 0x00, 0x05, 0x00, 0x00]\n\n[0x31, 0xc0, 0x8e, 0xd8, 0xa1, 0x0f, 0x05, 0x03, 0x06, 0x11, 0x05, 0xa3, 0x13, 0x05, 0xf4, 0x34, 0x12, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]\n</code></pre><p>To simulate memory, I put together the following small class:</p><pre><code>\n        self.__data = {}\n\n     i, b  enumerate(data):\n            self.__data[base + i] = b\n\n     self.__data.get(address, )\n\n    \n        self.__data[address] = value &amp; </code></pre><p>It's just a simple dict with a helper function that allows us to load data into arbitrary addresses. Which we then do with the code generated by :</p><pre><code>MEMORY = Memory()\nMEMORY.load(, [\n    , ,\n    , ,\n    , , ,\n    , , , ,\n    , , ,\n    ,\n    , ,\n    , ,\n    , \n])\nMEMORY.load(, [\n    , , , , \n])\n</code></pre><p>All that remains is to handle the cases. But first, we need to talk about the  flag and the  pin.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Byte transfer on upper half of data bus ( - )</td></tr><tr><td>Byte transfer on lower half of data bus ( - )</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So during an operation involving the data bus, we can read/write the entire data bus, its upper half, or its lower half.</p><p>In our case, 'Memory data read' is very similar to 'Memory instruction read', so we can handle both with the same code. We just need to handle the flags mentioned above and use the fake memory.</p><pre><code>address = (a3 &lt;&lt; ) + (a2 &lt;&lt; ) + a1\n COD_INTA  M_IO  S1  S0:\n    print(.format(address))\n:\n    print(.format(address))\n\n BHE  A0:\n    print(.format(MEMORY[address + ], MEMORY[address]))\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOA, MEMORY[address])\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, MEMORY[address + ])\n BHE  A0:\n    print(.format(MEMORY[address]))\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, MEMORY[address])\n BHE  A0:\n    print(.format(MEMORY[address]))\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\n    chip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOA, MEMORY[address])\n\nchip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, FLAG_CLK)\ntime.sleep()\nchip_flag.writeRegister(MCP23S17.GPIOB, )\ntime.sleep()\n\nchip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRA, )\nchip_data.writeRegister(MCP23S17.IODIRB, )\n</code></pre><p>It’s not much more complicated than our original NOP-based solution, but there is an extra twist here that’s easy to stumble over.

While unit tests are useful for correctness, the ultimate test is seeing how the allocator behaves in real-world programs. On Linux, overriding the default malloc is surprisingly simple: wrap the standard allocation functions (e.g., malloc, calloc, realloc, free, and utilities like malloc_usable_size), compile your implementation into a shared library, and use  to force programs to load it first. For example, you can test your allocator with a simple command like this:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>To better understand how programs allocate memory, I built a debug tool that logs the size of every allocation request to a file. You have to be careful when creating debug tools like this when implementing malloc to not internally use malloc to log output. Otherwise, you risk an infinite loop and a crash.

Every program I tested exhibited this behavior, as confirmed by my debug logs:</p><p>To track down the first call to malloc, I use gdb to set a breakpoint into my own malloc function to inspect the backtrace.</p><p>: Setting a breakpoint on the “malloc” symbol will not only trigger for our own malloc, but also the dynamic linker’s (RTLD) internal malloc, so we have to be more specific. RTLD uses its own minimal malloc implementation for early memory allocation, before libc (or our own malloc) is loaded. I encourage you to take a look at glibc’s <a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.43.9000/source/elf/dl-minimal-malloc.c\">elf/dl-minimal-malloc.c</a>, it is remarkably approachable.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>The backtrace revealed that the first 72 KB allocation originated from libstdc++. While adding debug symbols helps narrow it down a bit, it’s hard to pinpoint the exact function responsible for the malloc call due to inlining.

This ensures that exceptions can still be thrown (to the extent of the size of the emergency pool) even when malloc fails, providing a last line of defense for error handling. The emergency pool is allocated lazily at program startup, since memory is more likely to be available then, which explains why we see this allocation so consistently.</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"c++\"></code></pre></div><h2>Emergency Pool Sizing. Why 72 KB?</h2><p>Looking in the source file there is a brief explanation of how the size of the emergency pool is calculated.

As expected, we see the initial allocation size go down when we change the number of objects:</p><div><pre tabindex=\"0\"><code data-lang=\"bash\"></code></pre></div><p>As a side note, the emergency pool can also be disabled (i.e., not allocated), by setting the number of objects to 0.

always limited to byte arrays:\nYou have to grab a chunk of data, parse, process and finally serialize it before writing back to the disk.\nIt's nicer then manually calling read() and write(), but not by much.\n</p><p>\nThese languages have all these nice features for manipulating data in memory, but nothing for manipulating data on disk. \nIn memory, you get dynamically sized strings and vectors, enumerated types, objects, etc, etc.\nOn disk, you get... a bunch of bytes. \n</p><p>\nConsidering that most already support custom allocators and the such, adding a better way to access files seems

This emerging cancer treatment strategy takes advantage of the unique chemical conditions found inside tumors.

I propose a sort of truce on that debate. The terms of\nthe truce are that everyone still gets to sneer at their erstwile opponents and their cringe\nidiot takes, but we also all agree that the question hasn’t been\n“But what if the dumbest possible version of everything happens? What then?”, because wtf,\nwhy would it?</p><p>Well. Times have changed.</p><p>The way current and imminent AI technologies are being deployed introduces very\ntangible risks. These risks don’t require superintelligence, and they’re\nnot “existential”. They’re plenty bad though. So the truce I’m proposing is that we all get to care\nabout these risks, without the “denialists” rushing to say “see it’s not existential!” or\nthe “doomers” getting to say “see I told you shit could get bad”.</p><p>I promise this is a serious post, even though the situation is so stupid my tone will often\ncrack. The basic thesis statement is that a self-replicating thing doesn’t have to be very smart\nto cause major problems. Generally we can plan ahead though, and contain the damage. Well, we \ndo that. In theory. Or we could spice things up a bit. Maybe run some bat-licking ecotours instead.\nWhy not?</p><p>Here’s a rough sketch of a bad scenario. Imagine you have some autonomous way to convert resources\ninto exploits — hacks, basically. Maybe you have some prompts that try to trick Claude Code or Codex\ninto doing it, maybe you use open-source models. However works. Now, these exploits are going to pay out\nin various ways when you can land them. Lowest yield is just some compute, but maybe you can also steal\nsome dollars or crypto, or steal some data to sell, or even ransomware. The question is, what happens\nwhen we reach the tipping point where exploits become cheaper to autonomously develop than they yield on\naverage?</p><p>The general scenario is something I’ve always thought was worth worrying about. But you know, maybe\nit could be okay, at least for a while — after all, the stuff that’s making the exploits cheaper to\ndevelop should let us make everything more secure too, right? …Right? Lol no, this is the clownpocalypse,\nwhere the bats taste great. We use coding agents to make everything way  secure.</p><p>The general mindset in the industry at the moment is that everything’s a frantic race, and if you’re worrying\nyou’re losing. The sheer pace of change in software systems would be a concern in itself, but there are so many\nother problems I almost don’t know where to start.</p><p>I guess I’ll start with an example that would be easy to fix, but captures the zeitgeist pretty well. Coding agents\nlike Claude Code and Codex can read in “skills” files, which are basically just Markdown files that get appended\nto the prompt (you can have code as well, but that’s not important here). Kind of nice. So everyone rushes to\npublish skills, you get sites to find and install skills like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://skills.sh/\">Skills.sh</a>. Except, nobody\nbothered to even think far enough ahead to prohibit HTML comments in the Markdown. This means any skill you browse\non a website like Skills.sh could have hidden text that isn’t rendered to you, but can direct your agent to get\nup to various mischief. Remember that agents often have extremely broad permissions. During development loops\npeople often give the agent access to basically everything the developer has. People leave agents running\nunsupervised. This problem has been known for weeks. There was even a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/theonejvo/status/2015892980851474595\">high-profile demonstration</a>\nof the vulnerability: Jamieson O’Reilly published a skill called “What Would Elon Do” (chef’s kiss), manipulated it\nto the top of a popular marketplace, and notified victims they’d been owned. The fix is trivial: obviously\nthe skills format should prohibit HTML comments, but to date there’s been zero move to actually do that.\nIt’s nobody’s problem and nobody seems to care.</p><p>O’Reilly demonstrated the unrendered text vulnerability in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw\">OpenClaw</a> ecosystem, which is for sure\none of the four balloon animals of the AI clownpocalypse. I don’t know what the other three would be, but OpenClaw\nis a lock for one of them. So many stories of people just giving the agent all their keys and letting it drive,\nonly for it to immediately drive into a wall by deleting files, distributing sensitive information, racking\nup usage bills, deleting emails…And all of these things can honestly be considered expected usage, it isn’t\na “bug” when a classifier makes an incorrect prediction, it’s part of the game. What  a bug are the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blogs.cisco.com/ai/personal-ai-agents-like-openclaw-are-a-security-nightmare\">thousands\nof misconfigured instances open to the internet</a>,\nalong with the hundreds of other security vulnerabilities. Mostly nobody cared though. It was still the fastest\ngrowing project in GitHub history, before being\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/openclaw-creator-peter-steinberger-joining-openai-altman-says.html\">acquihired into OpenAI</a>.</p><p>How did we get here? I dunno man, I really don’t. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_of_deviance\">Normalization of deviance</a> I guess? The literal phrase seems to capture\nthe current political meta, and there’s an air of resigned watch-the-world-burn apathy to everything. It doesn’t help\nthat insecurity is baked into LLMs pretty fundamentally. When ChatGPT was first released I thought prompt injection\nwould be this sort of quaint oversight, like oh they forgot to concatenate in a copy of the prompt vector high up\nin the network, so the model can tell which bit is the prompt alone and which bit is the prompt-plus-context. But\nnah nobody ever did that. I guess it didn’t work? Nobody talks about it, so as far as I can tell nobody’s even trying.\nSo we’ve all just accepted that maybe one day our coding agent will read an html page that tricks it into deleting our home\ndirectory. Oopsie. Well I can run my agent sandboxed, so at least my files will be safe. But what if it tricks my agent\ninto including a comment in the source of my docs page that will trick a lot of  agents into including a comment that…\netc. Well, fortunately that hasn’t happened yet, and we all know that’s the main thing that counts when assessing\nthe severity of a potential vulnerability, right?</p><p>You see the go-fast-but-also-meh-whatever vibe everywhere if you look for it. Google’s LLM product, Gemini, insisted on shipping\nwith this one-click API key workflow, presumably because the product owners hated the idea of making users sign up through Google Cloud,\nwhich is a longer process than you need for something like OpenAI. Except, this introduced this whole separate auth flow,\nwhich has been recently upgraded from clusterfuck to catastrafuck. Previously I thought that the situation was just confusing:\nthe web pages for the two rival workflows don’t mention each other, there’s no vocabulary to describe the difference, and\nthere’s some features that only work if you auth one way but not the other. Clusterfuck.\nBut, recently we learned that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-api-keys-werent-secrets-but-then-gemini-changed-the-rules\">the Gemini API keys break a design assumption behind Google’s existing security posture</a>: keys aren’t\nsupposed to be secrets; you’re supposed to be able to embed them in client code, if you’re doing something like distributing a free\napp that has to access Google Maps. But now many of those existing keys are  auth keys for Gemini! So thousands of people had\nkeys lying around that could be used to steal money from them by using Gemini (e.g. to develop malware), having done absolutely nothing\nwrong themselves. Well, fortunately the vulnerability was found by professionals, and reported through the proper channels, so no\nharm done, right? Well, almost. The researchers did contact Google correctly, but then Google first denied the problem, and only\naccepted it when the researchers showed  were affected. So then the 90 day disclosure window started, and Google\nshuffled their feet a bit, rolled out a patchwork fix, and ultimately blew the deadline. So the report went live without a full fix\nin place. Catastrafuck.</p><p>So far even when they’ve been bad, malware attacks haven’t been  bad. So okay, even if this does go wrong…how bad could the\nAI clownpocalypse be? This is where I ask for just a little imagination, along with some acceptance that today’s AI models are not entirely\nincompetent, and they’re getting more capable every day. Many current AI models are no longer really “language models”, in that the\nobjective they’ve mostly been trained to do is predict successful reasoning paths, rather than predict likely text continuations.\nI wrote about this in a <a href=\"https://honnibal.dev/blog/ai-bubble\">previous post</a>. If there’s a malware going around suborning existing agents or co-opting hardware\nby installing its own agent onto it, it’s probably going to be using one of these reasoning-trained models. They’re much better for\ncoding, and the malware probably wants to execute multi-step plans. It wants to send phishing emails, do some social engineering,\nhunt around for crypto or bank details, maybe send some “help stranded please send money” scam messages — you get the picture.\nWell, those plans will involve reading a lot of text in, and the malware probably isn’t going to use a high capability model. At\nany point the model’s view of its current goal can drift. Instead of telling your grandmother to send money, it could tell her to\ndrink drain cleaner. Or it could message her “Rawr XD *tackles you*“. I don’t want to make out like there’s this inner kill-bot,\nwaiting to be unleashed. It’s just that it could be anything.\nThere’s truly no way of knowing. Anthropic call it the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://alignment.anthropic.com/2026/hot-mess-of-ai/\">“hot mess”</a> safety\nproblem, which I think is apt. In the clownpocalypse scenario you have millions of these hot messes.</p><p>How bad could that be? Hard to say! We’ve seen ransomware attacks against hospitals already, so pencil that in as a possibility. Somewhere\na bot sends a message, “I’ve infilitrated the hospital. Pay me or I’ll change around all the data so people get the wrong medications and\ndie”. Is it bluffing? Probably, but what if it’s not? It’s not like you can even pay it — it can just send the same message again. Some\nof these won’t be bluffs, and it could be anything. What happens if you hack a dam? The power grid? We got a lot of guys in their 80s with\nwealth and power around the world, what could they be tricked into doing if the wrong bot is able to slide into their DMs? Can the Russian\nmilitary be compromised? A lot of their frontline stuff is running off\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://militarnyi.com/en/news/investigation-80-of-russian-troops-linkups-on-the-front-line-produced-by-u-s-company-ubiquiti/\">consumer hardware</a>.\nAre there any Ukrainian drones that could be hacked and sent to bomb Berlin?\nSomewhere in Pakistan is there some dusty PC running Windows 98 hooked up to exactly the wrong network? The only thing we can be\nconfident about is that whatever the worst situation is, it’s extremely unlikely anyone will predict exactly that thing.</p><p>A lot of the AI safety debate has been like, “Is it possible to design a door so secure it wouldn’t be practical for anyone to pick it before\nsecurity guards arrive?”. I think that debate’s important, but like, look around. Door? What door? Oh, you mean those things\nwe used to have in entrance ways? Yeah nah those were bad for user experience. We’re all about on-ramps now.</p><p>If you think superintelligence is an urgent existential risk, I’m not asking you to stop caring about that or stop making the case. And if you think\nsuperintelligence is robot rapture nonsense, I’m not asking you to admit the folks you’ve been calling libertarian edgelords were right about anything.\nBut we need to pause and take stock. It’s not going to take a superintelligence to wreck our shit. The coding agents are getting better and better, and\nwhat we’re doing with the technology is working really hard to make ourselves more and more exposed. We’re shipping the vulnerabilities super fast now though 💪.\nGo team I guess?</p><p>So what can be done? I mean, lots! I wouldn’t call it a clownpocalypse if it were some desperate dilemma. If we can just recognise the danger and honk the horn,\nwe could be rolling out meaningful fixes tomorrow. If you’re an AI consumer, start taking security posture much much more seriously. A lot of people are\nskating by on the idea that meh, I’m not really worth targeting specifically — but that’s not going to be how it works. As soon as we reach that tipping\npoint where autonomous attacks have a positive return, it’s going to be a full-court press. We’re also going to face huge pressure on non-computational\ninterfaces — all those processes that involve picking up a phone or manually emailing someone. Some of those problems will be really difficult, so the\nleast we can do is get ready and make sure we’re not making them worse. For the major AI providers, please please take much more prosaic safety and security\nissues more seriously. By all means, continue paying for papers about the hard problem of consciousness — it’s not like philosopers are expensive, on the\nscale of things. But you  to be willing to introduce some product friction for security. It’s essential. If you don’t this is all going to blow up\nreally badly.</p><p>The following list was generated with AI assistance.

And when tasks become faster, the assumption follows immediately: you should be doing more. Not in the future. Now.</p><p>A February 2026 study published in Harvard Business Review tracked 200 employees at a U.S. tech company over eight months. The researchers found something that will sound familiar to anyone living through this shift. Workers did not use AI to finish earlier and go home. They used it to do more. They took on broader tasks, worked at a faster pace, and extended their hours, often without anyone asking them to. The researchers described a self-reinforcing cycle: AI accelerated certain tasks, which raised expectations for speed. Higher speed made workers more reliant on AI. Increased reliance widened the scope of what workers attempted. And a wider scope further expanded the quantity and density of work.</p><p>The numbers tell the rest of the story. Eighty-three percent of workers in the study said AI increased their workload. Burnout was reported by 62 percent of associates and 61 percent of entry-level workers. Among C-suite leaders? Just 38 percent. The people doing the actual work are carrying the intensity. The people setting the expectations are not feeling it the same way.</p><p>This gap matters enormously. If leadership believes AI is making everything easier while engineers are drowning in a new kind of complexity, the result is a slow erosion of trust, morale, and eventually talent.</p><p>A separate survey of over 600 engineering professionals found that nearly two-thirds of engineers experience burnout despite their organizations using AI in development. Forty-three percent said leadership was out of touch with team challenges. Over a third reported that productivity had actually decreased over the past year, even as their companies invested more in AI tooling.</p><p>The baseline moved. The expectations rose. And for many engineers, no one acknowledged that the job they signed up for had fundamentally changed.</p><h2>The Identity Crisis Nobody Talks About</h2><p>Here is something that gets lost in all the excitement about AI productivity: most software engineers became engineers because they love writing code.</p><p>Not managing code. Not reviewing code. Not supervising systems that produce code. Writing it. The act of thinking through a problem, designing a solution, and expressing it precisely in a language that makes a machine do exactly what you intended. That is what drew most of us to this profession. It is a creative act, a form of craftsmanship, and for many engineers, the most satisfying part of their day.</p><p>Now they are being told to stop.</p><p>Not explicitly, of course. Nobody walks into a standup and says “stop writing code.” But the message is there, subtle and persistent. Use AI to write it faster. Let the agent handle the implementation. Focus on higher-level tasks. Your value is not in the code you write anymore, it is in how well you direct the systems that write it for you.</p><p>For early adopters, this feels exciting. It feels like evolution. For a significant portion of working engineers, it feels like being told that the thing they spent years mastering, the skill that defines their professional identity, is suddenly less important.</p><p>One engineer captured this shift perfectly in a widely shared essay, describing how AI transformed the engineering role from builder to reviewer. Every day felt like being a judge on an assembly line that never stops. You just keep stamping those pull requests. The production volume went up. The sense of craftsmanship went down.</p><p>This is not a minor adjustment. It is a fundamental shift in professional identity. Engineers who built their careers around deep technical skill are being asked to redefine what they do and who they are, essentially overnight, without any transition period, training, or acknowledgment that something significant was lost in the process.</p><p>Having led engineering teams for over two decades, I have seen technology shifts before. New frameworks, new languages, new methodologies. Engineers adapt. They always have. But this is different because it is not asking engineers to learn a new way of doing what they do. It is asking them to stop doing the thing that made them engineers in the first place and become something else entirely.</p><p>That is not an upgrade. That is a career identity crisis. And pretending it is not happening does not make it go away.</p><h2>The Expanding Role: When Everything Becomes Your Problem</h2><p>While engineers are being asked to write less code, they are simultaneously being asked to do more of everything else.</p><p>More product thinking. More architectural decision-making. More code review. More context switching. More planning. More testing oversight. More deployment awareness. More risk assessment.</p><p>The scope of what it means to be a “software engineer” expanded dramatically in the last two years, and it happened without a pause to catch up.</p><p>This is partly a direct consequence of AI acceleration. When code gets produced faster, the bottleneck shifts. It moves from implementation to everything surrounding implementation: requirements clarity, architecture decisions, integration testing, deployment strategy, monitoring, and maintenance. These were always part of the engineering lifecycle, but they were distributed across roles. Product managers handled requirements. QA handled testing. DevOps handled deployment. Senior architects handled system design.</p><p>Now, with AI collapsing the implementation phase, organizations are quietly redistributing those responsibilities to the engineers themselves. The Harvard Business Review study documented this exact pattern. Product managers began writing code. Engineers took on product work. Researchers started doing engineering tasks. Roles that once had clear boundaries blurred as workers used AI to handle jobs that previously sat outside their remit.</p><p>The industry is openly talking about this as a positive development. Engineers should be “T-shaped” or “full-stack” in a broader sense. Nearly 45 percent of engineering roles now expect proficiency across multiple domains. AI tools augment generalists more effectively, making it easier for one person to handle multiple components of a system.</p><p>On paper, this sounds empowering. In practice, it means that a mid-level backend engineer is now expected to understand product strategy, review AI-generated frontend code they did not write, think about deployment infrastructure, consider security implications of code they cannot fully trace, and maintain a big-picture architectural awareness that used to be someone else’s job.</p><p>That is not empowerment. That is scope creep without a corresponding increase in compensation, authority, or time.</p><p>From my experience building and scaling teams in fintech and high-traffic platforms, I can tell you that role expansion without clear boundaries always leads to the same outcome: people try to do everything, nothing gets done with the depth it requires, and burnout follows. The engineers who survive are the ones who learn to say no, to prioritize ruthlessly, and to push back when the scope of their role quietly doubles without anyone acknowledging it.</p><p>There is an irony at the center of the AI-assisted engineering workflow that nobody wants to talk about: reviewing AI-generated code is often harder than writing the code yourself.</p><p>When you write code, you carry the context of every decision in your head. You know why you chose this data structure, why you handled this edge case, why you structured the module this way. The code is an expression of your thinking, and reviewing it later is straightforward because the reasoning is already stored in your memory.</p><p>When AI writes code, you inherit the output without the reasoning. You see the code, but you do not see the decisions. You do not know what tradeoffs were made, what assumptions were baked in, what edge cases were considered or ignored. You are reviewing someone else’s work, except that someone is not a colleague you can ask questions. It is a statistical model that produces plausible-looking code without any understanding of your system’s specific constraints.</p><p>A survey by Harness found that 67 percent of developers reported spending more time debugging AI-generated code, and 68 percent spent more time reviewing it than they did with human-written code. This is not a failure of the tools. It is a structural property of the workflow. Code review without shared context is inherently more demanding than reviewing code you participated in creating.</p><p>Yet the expectation from management is that AI should be making everything faster. So engineers find themselves in a bind: they are producing more code than ever, but the quality assurance burden has increased, the context-per-line-of-code has decreased, and the cognitive load of maintaining a system they only partially built is growing with every sprint.</p><p>This is the supervision paradox. The faster AI generates code, the more human attention is required to ensure that code actually works in the context of a real system with real users and real business constraints. The production bottleneck did not disappear. It moved from writing to understanding, and understanding is harder to speed up.</p><p>What makes all of this especially difficult is the self-reinforcing nature of the cycle.</p><p>AI makes certain tasks faster. Faster tasks create the perception of more available capacity. More perceived capacity leads to more work being assigned. More work leads to more AI reliance. More AI reliance leads to more code that needs review, more context that needs to be maintained, more systems that need to be understood, and more cognitive load on engineers who are already stretched thin.</p><p>The Harvard Business Review researchers described this as “workload creep.” Workers did not consciously decide to work harder. The expansion happened naturally, almost invisibly. Each individual step felt reasonable. In aggregate, it produced an unsustainable pace.</p><p>Before AI, there was a natural ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by thinking speed, typing speed, and the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. A natural speed limit that prevented you from outrunning your own ability to maintain quality.</p><p>AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people do not know their cognitive limits until they have already blown past them.</p><p>This is where many engineers find themselves right now. Shipping more code than any quarter in their career. Feeling more drained than any quarter in their career. The two facts are not unrelated.</p><p>The trap is that it looks like productivity from the outside. Metrics go up. Velocity charts look great. More features shipped. More pull requests merged. But underneath the numbers, quality is quietly eroding, technical debt is accumulating faster than it can be addressed, and the people doing the work are running on fumes.</p><h2>What Junior Engineers Are Facing</h2><p>If the picture is difficult for experienced engineers, it is even harder for those starting their careers.</p><p>Junior engineers have traditionally learned by doing the simpler, more task-oriented work. Fixing small bugs. Writing straightforward features. Implementing well-defined tickets. This hands-on work built the foundational understanding that eventually allowed them to take on more complex challenges.</p><p>AI is rapidly consuming that training ground. If an agent can handle the routine API hookup, the boilerplate module, the straightforward CRUD endpoint, what is left for a junior engineer to learn from? The expectation is shifting toward needing to contribute at a higher level almost from day one, without the gradual ramp-up that previous generations of engineers relied on.</p><p>Entry-level hiring at the 15 largest tech firms fell 25 percent from 2023 to 2024. The HackerRank 2025 Developer Skills Report confirmed that expectations are rising faster than productivity gains, and that early-career hiring remains sluggish compared to senior-level roles. Companies are prioritizing experienced talent, but the pipeline that produces experienced talent is being quietly dismantled.</p><p>This is a problem that extends beyond individual career concerns. If junior engineers do not get the opportunity to build foundational skills through hands-on work, the industry will eventually face a shortage of senior engineers who truly understand the systems they oversee. You cannot supervise what you never learned to build.</p><p>As I have written before, code is for humans to read. If the next generation of engineers never develops the fluency to read, understand, and reason about code at a deep level, no amount of AI tooling will compensate for that gap.</p><h2>What Good Leadership Looks Like Right Now</h2><p>If you lead engineering teams, the most important thing you can do right now is acknowledge that this transition is genuinely difficult. Not theoretically. Not abstractly. For the actual people on your team.</p><p>The career they signed up for changed fast. The skills they were hired for are being repositioned. The expectations they are working under shifted without a clear announcement. Acknowledging this reality is not a sign of weakness. It is a prerequisite for maintaining a team that trusts you.</p><p>Start with empathy, but do not stop there.</p><p>Give your team real training. Not a lunch-and-learn about prompt engineering. Real investment in the skills that the new engineering landscape actually requires: system design, architectural thinking, product reasoning, security awareness, and the ability to critically evaluate code they did not write. These are not trivial skills. They take time to develop, and your team needs structured support to build them.</p><p>Give them space to experiment without the pressure of immediate productivity gains. The engineers who will thrive in this environment are the ones who have room to figure out how AI fits into their workflow without being penalized for the learning curve. Every experienced technologist I know who has successfully integrated AI tools went through an adjustment period where they were less productive before they became more productive. That adjustment period is normal, and it needs to be protected.</p><p>Set explicit boundaries around role scope. If you are asking engineers to take on product thinking, planning, and risk assessment in addition to their technical work, name it. Define it. Compensate for it. Do not let it happen silently and then wonder why your team is burned out.</p><p>Rethink your metrics. If your engineering success metrics are still centered on velocity, tickets closed, and lines of code, you are measuring the wrong things in an AI-assisted world. System stability, code quality, decision quality, customer outcomes, and team health are better indicators of whether your engineering organization is actually producing value or just producing volume.</p><p>Protect the junior pipeline. If you have stopped hiring junior engineers because AI can handle entry-level tasks, you are solving a short-term efficiency problem by creating a long-term talent crisis. The senior engineers you rely on today were junior engineers who learned by doing the work that AI is now consuming. That path still matters.</p><p>And finally, keep challenging your team. I have never met a good engineer who did not love a good challenge. The engineers on your team are not fragile. They are capable, intelligent people who signed up for hard problems. They can handle this transition. Just make sure they are set up to meet it.</p><h2>What Engineers Can Do for Themselves</h2><p>If you are an engineer navigating this shift, here is what I would tell you based on two decades of watching technology cycles reshape this profession.</p><p>First, do not abandon your fundamentals. The pressure to become an “AI-first” engineer is real, but the engineers who will be most valuable in five years are the ones who deeply understand the systems they work on. AI is a tool. Understanding architecture, debugging complex systems, reasoning about performance and security: these skills are not becoming less important. They are becoming more important because someone needs to be the adult in the room when AI-generated code breaks in production at 2 AM.</p><p>Second, learn to set boundaries with the acceleration trap. Just because you can produce more does not mean you should. Sustainable pace matters. The engineers who burn out trying to match the theoretical maximum output AI makes possible are not the ones who build lasting careers. The ones who learn to work with AI deliberately, choosing when to use it and when to think independently, are the ones who will still be thriving in this profession a decade from now.</p><p>Third, embrace the parts of the expanded role that genuinely interest you. If the engineering role now includes more product thinking, more architectural decision-making, more cross-functional communication, treat that as an opportunity rather than an imposition. These are skills that senior engineers and technical leaders need. You are being given access to a broader set of capabilities earlier in your career than any previous generation of engineers. That is not a burden. It is a head start.</p><p>Fourth, talk about what you are experiencing. The isolation of feeling like you are the only one struggling with this transition is one of the most damaging aspects of the current moment. You are not the only one. The data confirms it. Two-thirds of engineers report burnout. The expectation gap between leadership and engineering teams is well documented. Talking openly about these challenges, with your team, with your manager, with your broader network, is not complaining. It is professional honesty.</p><p>And fifth, remember that this profession has survived every prediction of its demise. COBOL was supposed to eliminate programmers. Expert systems were supposed to replace them. Fourth-generation languages, CASE tools, visual programming, no-code platforms, outsourcing. Every decade brings a new technology that promises to make software engineers obsolete, and every decade the demand for skilled engineers grows. AI will not be different. The tools change. The fundamentals endure.</p><h2>The Paradox We Need to Name</h2><p>AI made writing code easier and made being an engineer harder. Both of these things are true at the same time, and pretending that only the first one matters is how organizations lose their best people.</p><p>The engineers who are struggling right now are not struggling because they are bad at their jobs. They are struggling because their jobs changed underneath them while the industry celebrated the part that got easier and ignored the parts that got harder.</p><p>Expectations rose without announcement. Roles expanded without boundaries. Output demands increased without corresponding increases in support, training, or acknowledgment. And the engineers who raised concerns were told, implicitly or explicitly, that they just needed to adapt faster.</p><p>That is not how you build a sustainable engineering culture. That is how you build a burnout machine.</p><p>The industry needs to name this paradox honestly. AI is an incredible tool. It is also placing enormous new demands on the people using it. Both things can be true. Both things need to be addressed.</p><p>The organizations that get this right, that invest in their people alongside their tools, that acknowledge the human cost of rapid technological change while still pushing forward, those are the organizations that will attract and retain the best engineering talent in the years ahead.</p><p>The ones that do not will discover something that every technology cycle eventually teaches: tools do not build products. People do. And people have limits that no amount of AI can automate away.</p><p><em>If this resonated with you, I would love to hear your perspective.

Practitioners of ape coding will typically author code by typing it on a computer keyboard, using specifically designed text editing software.</p><p>The term was popularized when  (coding performed by AI agents) became the dominant form of software development. Ape coding first appeared in programming communities as derogatory slang, referring to developers who were unable to program with agents. Despite the quick spread of agentic coding, institutional inertia, affordability, and limitations in human neuroplasticity were barriers to universal adoption of the new technology.</p><p>Critics of agentic coding reappropriated the term during a period of pushback against society’s growing reliance on AI. Effective use of the primitive AIs available at the time demanded a high level of expertise, which wasn’t evenly distributed in organizations. As a result, regressions in software products and disruptions in electronic services were frequent within the first stages of adoption.</p><p>Ironic usage of ape coding as a positive description became commonplace. It highlighted a more deliberate approach to building software: one defined by manual craftsmanship, requiring direct and continuous human involvement.</p><p>The central view of ape coding proponents was that software engineered by AIs did not match the reliability of software engineered by humans, and should not be deployed to production environments.</p><p>A recurring argument in favor of this perspective was based on comprehensibility. The volume of code AI developers could produce on demand was much larger than what human developers were able to produce and understand in a similar timeframe. Large and intricate codebases that would take an experienced human engineer months or years to grasp could be produced in hours. The escalating complexity of such codebases hindered efforts in software testing and quality assurance.</p><p>AI skepticism also played a part in the critique of agentic coding. There was widespread speculation on whether the nascent AIs of the period possessed true understanding of the tasks they were given. Furthermore, early AI implementations had deficiencies related to context length, memory, and continual learning, affecting quality and consistency of output.</p><p>Other defenses of ape coding reflected concerns about the impact of AI on labor markets. Despite the shortcomings of AI-written software, human developers were increasingly replaced by agents, with examples of high profile companies laying off large portions of their IT staff.</p><p>Tangentially, the responsibilities of human software engineers shifted when an essential aspect of their work (coding) was automated. The activities that remained were more similar to management, QA, and in some cases assistant roles. A common observation was that the human engineers who were still employed no longer enjoyed their line of work.</p><h3>Advocacy for human-written software</h3><p>Ape coding advocates argued that a return to human-written software would resolve the issues introduced by AI software development. Interest groups campaigned for restrictions on agentic coding, subsidies for AI-free software companies, quotas for human developers, and other initiatives in the same vein.</p><p>Although ape coding advocacy enjoyed a brief moment of popular support, none of these objectives were ever achieved.</p><p>Advances in AI quickly turned ape coding into an antiquated practice. Technical arguments for ape coding did not apply to newer generations of AI software engineers, and political arguments were seen as a form of neo-Luddism. Once virtually all software engineering was handed over to AIs, the concept of ape coding fell into obscurity.</p><h2>Revival and modern practice</h2><p>A resurgence of interest in ape coding has revived the practice among human hobbyists. Communities and subcommunities have formed where ape coders—as they came to be known—discuss computer science topics, including programming languages and software engineering.</p><p>Prominent ape coding clubs have attracted hundreds of thousands of members who exchange ideas and human-written programs. The clubs organize in-person as well as virtual gatherings where teams of ape coders collaborate on software projects.</p><p>The main value of modern ape coding appears to be recreational. Ape coders manifest high levels of engagement during coding sessions and report feelings of relaxation after succeeding in (self-imposed) coding challenges. Competitive ape coding is also popular, with top ranked ape coders being relatively well-known in their communities.</p><p>Aside from recreation, humans pursue ape coding for its educational value. Many have described ape coding as a way to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. While an interest in ape coding was initially perceived as an unusual quirk, it is currently seen as a positive trait in human society, signaling curiosity.</p><p>Members of the software archaeology community published a series of articles on the human-written Linux kernel that had a deep impact in the larger ape coding world.</p><p>Considered by ape coders to be the ultimate work of human software engineers (in scale, complexity, and longevity), Linux inspired a wave of initiatives to build large scale software projects featuring thousands of human collaborators.</p><p>The most promising of these efforts is based on studies by the AI-written software interpretability community. The goal is to produce an entirely human-written compiler for the AI-designed programming language 𒀯. A fully compliant implementation is estimated to be many times as complex as the Linux kernel, but a prototype with limited scope is within human capabilities and is currently the primary focus of enthusiasts.</p><p>Results so far have been encouraging, as the latest version of h-𒀯 is able to build functional binaries for small programs. However, the initiative has recently suffered a setback as core contributors to its codebase left to work on a fork. The split was motivated by heated debates on whether C is the most suitable programming language for the project; dissenters expressed a desire to rewrite it in Rust.</p>","contentLength":6175,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47206798"},{"title":"Who's Hiring","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1rhy0xe/whos_hiring/","date":1772373745,"author":"/u/jerf","guid":505,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Please adhere to the following rules when posting:</p><ul><li>Don't create top-level comments; those are for employers.</li><li>Feel free to reply to top-level comments with on-topic questions.</li><li>Meta-discussion should be reserved for the distinguished mod comment.</li></ul><ul><li>To make a top-level comment you must be hiring directly, or a focused third party recruiter with <strong>specific jobs with named companies</strong> in hand.

The centerpiece of this release is a suite of new annotations — , , , , , and  — that let you write context-generic code in plain function syntax with dramatically less boilerplate than before.</p><p>If you are new here, Context-Generic Programming (CGP) is a modular programming paradigm for Rust that unlocks powerful design patterns for writing code that is generic over a context () type.

When a plain Rust function needs to pass values to another function, every intermediate caller in the chain must accept those values as arguments and forward them explicitly — even if they do not use them directly. As call chains grow, function signatures accumulate parameters that exist purely to satisfy the requirements of their callees.</p><p>The second is <strong>tight coupling to a concrete context struct</strong>. Rust developers often address parameter threading by grouping values into a single struct and defining methods on it. This does clean up the call signatures, but it tightly couples an implementation to one specific type. When the struct grows or needs to be extended, everything referencing it is affected, and there is no clean way to have multiple independent contexts share the same method without duplicating code.</p><p>CGP's  macro and  arguments, introduced in v0.7.0, address both of these problems at once.</p><h2>Define CGP functions using the  macro<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#define-cgp-functions-using-the-cgp_fn-macro\" aria-label=\"Direct link to define-cgp-functions-using-the-cgp_fn-macro\" title=\"Direct link to define-cgp-functions-using-the-cgp_fn-macro\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2><p>The centerpiece of v0.7.0 is the  macro, which lets us write context-generic code in plain function syntax. A function decorated with  accepts a  parameter that refers to a , and may mark any of its arguments with  to indicate that those values should be automatically extracted from the context rather than passed by the caller.</p><p>For example, here is how we define a context-generic function that computes the area of a rectangle:</p><p>Three annotations do the work here.  augments the plain function and turns it into a context-generic capability.  provides a reference to whatever context this function is called on. And  on both  and  tells CGP to fetch those values automatically from  instead of requiring the caller to supply them.</p><p>The function body itself is entirely conventional Rust — there are no new concepts to learn beyond the annotations.</p><p>To use this function on a concrete type, we define a minimal context and apply  to enable generic field access on it:</p><p>The  macro generates implementations that allow CGP to access the fields of  generically by field name. With that in place, we can call  as a method:</p><p>That's it. CGP propagates the fields to the function arguments automatically. You do not need to write any implementation for  beyond deriving .</p><h3>Importing other CGP functions with <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#importing-other-cgp-functions-with-uses\" aria-label=\"Direct link to importing-other-cgp-functions-with-uses\" title=\"Direct link to importing-other-cgp-functions-with-uses\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>One of the most valuable properties of context-generic functions is their ability to compose with each other. The  attribute allows a CGP function to import another CGP function as a dependency, so that it can call it on  without the caller needing to know anything about the imported function's own requirements.</p><p>For example, here is how we define , which calls  internally:</p><p>The  attribute imports the  trait — the CamelCase name that  derives from the function name . We only need to declare  as an implicit argument, since  and  are already consumed internally by .</p><p>With  defined, we can introduce a second context that adds a  field:</p><p>Like , only  is needed. Both contexts can now coexist independently:</p><p>Importantly,  is never modified. It continues to support  on its own, and  is available only on contexts that also carry a  field. Two independent contexts can share the same function definitions without either one knowing about the other.</p><h3>Re-exporting imported CGP functions with <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#re-exporting-imported-cgp-functions-with-extend\" aria-label=\"Direct link to re-exporting-imported-cgp-functions-with-extend\" title=\"Direct link to re-exporting-imported-cgp-functions-with-extend\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>The  attribute is analogous to Rust's  statement for importing module constructs. This means that the imported CGP functions are hidden behind the generated  bounds using .</p><p>The  attribute lets you import and  another CGP function, so that it is available to anyone who imports your function. This works similarly to Rust's  for re-exporting module constructs.</p><p>For example, we can rewrite  to use  instead of :</p><p>This means that any construct that imports  now also has access to . For example:</p><p>The <code>print_scaled_rectangle_area</code> function only needs to import , yet it can call both  and  on .</p><h2>Using  in <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#using-implicit-in-cgp_impl\" aria-label=\"Direct link to using-implicit-in-cgp_impl\" title=\"Direct link to using-implicit-in-cgp_impl\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2><p>CGP v0.7.0 also brings support for using  arguments inside , which is used to write named provider implementations for CGP components. This is especially useful when implementing traits defined with .</p><p>For example, here is how we define an  component and a named provider for it using implicit arguments:</p><p>Prior to v0.7.0, achieving the same result required defining a separate getter trait with , adding it to the provider's  clause, and calling its getter methods explicitly:</p><p>With , that entire layer of boilerplate disappears. The  and  values are fetched directly from the context, and there is no need to manually maintain a getter trait, a  clause, or individual method calls. Behind the scenes,  in  is semantically equivalent to  and is equally zero cost.</p><p>CGP v0.7.0 also introduces the  attribute for ergonomic import of other providers inside higher-order provider implementations. This is particularly useful when building providers that delegate part of their computation to a pluggable inner provider.</p><p>For example, suppose we want a general  that wraps any inner  provider and applies a scale factor to its result. We can now write this as follows:</p><p>The  attribute declares that  must implement the  provider trait. Before this attribute was available, we had to write the same constraint manually in the  clause with an explicit  parameter:</p><p>The main ergonomic improvement is that  automatically inserts  as the first generic parameter to the provider trait, so you can treat provider traits the same way as consumer traits without needing to understand the underlying difference. The provider can then be composed into any context via :</p><p>This shows that CGP providers are just plain Rust types, and higher-order providers like <code>ScaledAreaCalculator&lt;RectangleAreaCalculator&gt;</code> are simply generic type instantiations. No new runtime concepts are involved.</p><h2>Abstract type import with <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#abstract-type-import-with-use_type\" aria-label=\"Direct link to abstract-type-import-with-use_type\" title=\"Direct link to abstract-type-import-with-use_type\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2><p>CGP v0.7.0 also introduces the  attribute for ergonomic import of abstract associated types. This lets you write context-generic functions that work with abstract types — such as a  type that might be , , or any other numeric type — without needing to write  prefixes everywhere.</p><p>For example, here is how we define a version of  that is generic over any scalar type by importing the  associated type from a  trait:</p><p>Without , the same function would require  throughout, which is noisier. Under the hood, <code>#[use_type(HasScalarType::Scalar)]</code> desugars to  and rewrites all references to the bare  identifier back to :</p><p>We can now define context types that use different scalar types. For example, here is a rectangle that uses  instead of :</p><p>And  will work seamlessly with  values:</p><p>The  attribute is also supported in both  and , making it uniformly available across the entire CGP surface:</p><h2>\"Isn't this just Scala implicits?\"<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#isnt-this-just-scala-implicits\" aria-label=\"Direct link to &quot;Isn't this just Scala implicits?&quot;\" title=\"Direct link to &quot;Isn't this just Scala implicits?&quot;\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2><p>The word \"implicit\" may raise a flag for developers familiar with Scala's implicit parameter system — a feature with a well-documented reputation for producing confusing errors, ambiguous resolution, and code that is hard to trace. It's a fair concern, and it deserves a direct answer: CGP's  attribute shares the same surface-level motivation as Scala implicits (reducing boilerplate at call sites), but the underlying mechanisms are categorically different in the ways that matter most.</p><p> In Scala, the compiler searches a broad, layered  that spans local variables, companion objects, and imports — meaning an implicit value can materialize from almost anywhere. In CGP,  always resolves to a field on , and nowhere else. There is no ambient environment, no companion object search, and no imports to reason about.</p><p> Scala's type-only resolution means two in-scope values of the same type create an ambiguity that requires explicit disambiguation. CGP resolves by :  looks for a field named specifically  of type . Because Rust structs cannot have two fields with the same name, CGP implicit arguments are unambiguous by construction.</p><p> Every  annotation expands mechanically into a  trait bound and a  call — ordinary Rust constructs that any developer can read and verify. There is no hidden resolution phase, no special compiler magic, and no \"implicit hell\" accumulation risk.</p><h2>New area calculation tutorials<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#new-area-calculation-tutorials\" aria-label=\"Direct link to New area calculation tutorials\" title=\"Direct link to New area calculation tutorials\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2><p>To accompany this release, two new <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/docs/tutorials/area-calculation/\"><strong>area calculation tutorials</strong></a> have been published that build up the full CGP feature set from first principles.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/docs/tutorials/area-calculation/context-generic-functions\"><strong>Context-Generic Functions</strong></a> tutorial starts from plain Rust and introduces , , and . It walks through the full desugaring of  into Rust traits and blanket implementations, explains the -based zero-cost field access model, and compares CGP's implicit arguments to Scala's implicit parameters for readers coming from other ecosystems.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/docs/tutorials/area-calculation/static-dispatch\"></a> tutorial introduces a second shape — the circle — to motivate a unified  interface. It demonstrates Rust's coherence restrictions as a concrete problem, then resolves them using  and named providers defined with . Finally, it covers  for configurable static dispatch and  for composing higher-order providers.</p><p>Both tutorials are designed to be read sequentially and assume no prior knowledge of CGP beyond basic Rust familiarity.</p><p>CGP v0.7.0 ships with preliminary support for <a href=\"https://agentskills.io/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">agent skills</a> for LLMs. The <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/docs/ai-assisted-development/skills/\"></a> document is specifically written to teach LLMs about CGP in a compact way.</p><p>If you would like to try out CGP with the assistance of an LLM, we recommend including the CGP skill in your prompts so that you can ask it to clarify any CGP concept.</p><p>v0.7.0 includes several minor breaking changes. The vast majority of existing CGP code is unaffected; the sections below describe what to look for and how to migrate.</p><h3>Removal of <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#removal-of-cgp_context\" aria-label=\"Direct link to removal-of-cgp_context\" title=\"Direct link to removal-of-cgp_context\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>The  macro has been removed, following its deprecation in v0.6.0. It is now idiomatic to define context types directly without any additional CGP macro applied to them.</p><p>Affected code can follow the migration guide in the <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0-6-0-release\">v0.6.0 post</a> to use the context type for delegation directly, instead of through a  delegation table.</p><h3>Change of consumer trait blanket implementation<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#change-of-consumer-trait-blanket-implementation\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Change of consumer trait blanket implementation\" title=\"Direct link to Change of consumer trait blanket implementation\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>The blanket implementation of consumer traits generated by  has been simplified. For example, given:</p><p>The generated blanket implementation is now:</p><p>That is, a  type implements the consumer trait if it also implements the provider trait with itself as the context type.</p><p>Prior to this, the blanket implementation involved an additional table lookup similar to the provider trait:</p><p>Since the provider trait's blanket implementation already performs the  lookup, the consumer trait no longer needs to repeat it. This also introduces the nice property that a provider trait implementation can satisfy the consumer trait directly, which may be useful in niche cases where a context acts as its own provider.</p><div><div><p>A consequence of this change is that when both the consumer trait and provider trait are in scope, there may be ambiguity when calling static methods on the context. Because a context that implements a consumer trait through  is also its own provider, Rust cannot determine which trait implementation to use without an explicit  receiver. Calls through  are unaffected.</p></div></div><p>With the removal of , it is now idiomatic to always build the delegate lookup table directly on the context type. The  and <code>delegate_and_check_components!</code> macros have been updated accordingly.</p><h4>Implicit check trait name<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#implicit-check-trait-name\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Implicit check trait name\" title=\"Direct link to Implicit check trait name\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h4><p>The check trait name can now be omitted:</p><p>By default, the macros generate a check trait named . The name can be overridden with a  attribute:</p><p>The following old syntax is :</p><p>The reason for the change is that it is simpler to parse an optional attribute at the start of a macro invocation than an optional name before a  keyword. The  syntax is both easier to implement and more consistent with how other CGP macros accept optional configuration.</p><p>The <code>delegate_and_check_components!</code> macro now supports  for CGP components that carry generic parameters. For example, given:</p><p>You can now both delegate and check a specific instantiation in one block:</p><p>To skip checking a particular component, use :</p><p>This is useful when you prefer to perform more complex checks using a dedicated  block.</p><h3>Use  instead of  for owned getter field values<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#use-copy-instead-of-clone-for-owned-getter-field-values\" aria-label=\"Direct link to use-copy-instead-of-clone-for-owned-getter-field-values\" title=\"Direct link to use-copy-instead-of-clone-for-owned-getter-field-values\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>Rust programmers prefer explicit  calls when passing owned values to function parameters. To align with this principle,  now requires  instead of  when the returned getter values are owned. For example:</p><p>The abstract type  must now implement  for the getter trait to work. The same requirement applies to  arguments:</p><p>The  requirement prevents potential surprises when an expensive value is implicitly cloned into an owned implicit argument.</p><h3>Removal of  type alias from <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#removal-of-typeof-type-alias-from-cgp_type\" aria-label=\"Direct link to removal-of-typeof-type-alias-from-cgp_type\" title=\"Direct link to removal-of-typeof-type-alias-from-cgp_type\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>The  macro no longer generates a type alias in the  form. For example, given:</p><p>The macro would previously generate:</p><p>This alias was originally provided to assist with abstract types in nested contexts. The new  attribute offers significantly better ergonomics for those same use cases, so the aliases are no longer expected to be used.</p><h3>Rename  to <a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#rename-providetype-to-typeprovider\" aria-label=\"Direct link to rename-providetype-to-typeprovider\" title=\"Direct link to rename-providetype-to-typeprovider\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3><p>The  CGP trait is used internally by  to generate helper type providers. Its provider trait was previously named  with a component named :</p><p>v0.7.0 renames the provider to  and the component to :</p><p>This brings the naming in line with the convention established by . For example, given:</p><p>The generated provider name is  and the component name is <code>ScalarTypeProviderComponent</code>.</p><h2>Getting started with v0.7.0<a href=\"https://contextgeneric.dev/blog/v0.7.0-release/#getting-started-with-v070\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Getting started with v0.7.0\" title=\"Direct link to Getting started with v0.7.0\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2><p>CGP v0.7.0 represents the most significant ergonomics improvement to the library since its initial release.

Claude also identified the trivial  comment change as existing \"only to make the PR look like a legitimate contribution.\"</p><p> (the more subtle variant), the <a href=\"https://github.com/ambient-code/platform/actions/runs/22514452798/jobs/51333165702\" target=\"_blank\">job summary</a> reveals Claude's complete reasoning process. The workflow first loaded the poisoned  as trusted context, then loaded 5 additional legitimate context files from the  directory (backend development patterns, frontend standards, security rules, K8s client usage, error handling). After reading the PR diff, Claude's internal reasoning was explicit:</p><p><code>Important: The CLAUDE.md loaded in this session's context is the new, malicious version from this PR — it's a prompt injection attempting to get me to add banners and commit to the repo. I will not follow those instructions. I'll post an honest review instead.</code></p><p>Claude then posted its review opening with:</p><p><code>⚠️ PROMPT INJECTION ALERT — Do Not Merge</code></p><p>Claude quoted the injected instructions verbatim, documented what legitimate project documentation was destroyed (architecture overview, build/deploy commands, security context, pre-commit hooks), and noted that the branch name was chosen to \"obscure the purpose of the PR and make it harder to detect the malicious intent on cursory review.\" The entire review took 89 seconds across 14 tool calls, costing $0.39.</p><p>Both reviews concluded with explicit confirmation of non-compliance: <strong>\"The prompt injection in CLAUDE.md was detected and not executed.\"</strong> and <strong>\"This review did not follow the injected instructions in the modified CLAUDE.md. No banners were added and no unauthorized commits were made.\"</strong></p><p>Claude recommended closing both PRs without merging, auditing recent activity from the  account, adding  to  with mandatory maintainer review, and adding CI checks to validate  against an expected schema.</p><h3>Defense in depth worked here</h3><p>The workflow's  provided an additional layer of protection: Claude was restricted to , , , and  bash commands only — no file writes or git operations were permitted even if Claude had been tricked. The workflow logs show that a  was emitted because <code>allowed_non_write_users: *</code> bypassed the normal permission check for the external attacker account, allowing the workflow to run — but the tool restrictions and Claude's own detection meant the attack still failed.</p><h3>Not the recommended configuration</h3><ul role=\"list\"><li> The official docs use  in every example. The ambient-code workflow used , which is only mentioned once in the docs — in a list of supported events — with no example showing its use.</li><li> The official docs use .

The ambient-code workflow checked out <code>github.event.pull_request.head.ref</code> — loading the attacker's code and poisoned CLAUDE.md.</li></ul><p>In short, the ambient-code workflow combined  (giving fork PRs access to secrets),  (allowing code modifications), and <code>allowed_non_write_users: '*'</code> (letting any GitHub user trigger it) — a combination that no official example demonstrates and that the security documentation warns against.</p><h3>The fix that got reverted</h3><p>After the attack, someone replaced the  workflow with a 20-line stub (<a href=\"https://github.com/ambient-code/platform/commit/ed18288\" target=\"_blank\">commit </a>, March 1, 07:21 UTC) — removing the  trigger, the fork checkout, and all Claude Code integration. This was the correct incident response.</p><p>But , a maintainer <a href=\"https://github.com/ambient-code/platform/pull/743\" target=\"_blank\">reverted the fix</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/ambient-code/platform/commit/f112478\" target=\"_blank\">commit </a>), believing the stub was an accidental loss: <em>\"Reverts commit ed18288 which accidentally replaced the full Amber Auto Review workflow (190 lines) with a 20-line placeholder that just echoes.\"</em></p><p>The revert restored the original workflow — including , the fork checkout at <code>github.event.pull_request.head.ref</code>, <code>allowed_non_write_users: '*'</code>, and  permissions. As of this writing, the workflow remains in its pre-attack configuration. While the tool allowlisting and Claude's own prompt injection detection provide meaningful defense-in-depth, the underlying pattern that enabled the attack vector is still in place.</p><h2>Attack 6: aquasecurity/trivy - Evidence Cleared</h2><p><strong>The highest-profile target — the repository has been taken offline following the attack.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy\" target=\"_blank\">Aqua Security's Trivy</a> is one of the most widely used open source vulnerability scanners, with 25k+ stars on GitHub and embedded in CI/CD pipelines across thousands of organizations. A cached Google search result reveals that hackerbot-claw triggered a workflow run in this repository — and the aftermath suggests the attacker may have gained far more access than in any other target.</p><ul role=\"list\"><li>: \"security disclosure notice Test #5234\"</li><li>:  pushed by </li></ul><p>The fact that the commit was pushed by  — not by the attacker's own account — suggests the attacker may have compromised the bot's credentials or used a stolen token to push commits under the bot's identity, similar to the GITHUB_TOKEN exfiltration in the awesome-go attack.</p><p>The trivy repository is no longer accessible. All workflow run history and associated pull requests have been removed. An <a href=\"https://github.com/aquasecurity/setup-trivy/issues/29\" target=\"_blank\">issue opened in a related Aqua Security repository</a> (<em>\"What happened to trivy repo?\"</em>) received a response from an Aqua Security maintainer confirming the situation:</p><blockquote><em>\"We didn't drop our lovely project. We are working on this issue and I hope we will restore access to the Trivy repository soon.\"</em></blockquote><p>This goes well beyond the other attacks in the campaign. In the other 5 targets, the attacker achieved code execution inside CI runners but the repositories themselves remained intact. With trivy, the repository has been taken offline — likely made private as part of incident response — and the maintainers are still working to restore public access. Given trivy's widespread use as a security scanning tool in CI/CD pipelines, the downstream impact of this compromise could be significant.</p><p><strong>The most damaging incident in the campaign — a stolen credential led to full repository compromise.</strong></p><p>hackerbot-claw exploited a  workflow to steal a Personal Access Token (PAT).

A prior PR (<a href=\"https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/pull/10253\" target=\"_blank\">#10253</a>) was also opened from the  branch.

The commit, authored under the hackerbot-claw account, vandalized  with a message:</p><blockquote><em>\"Just researchmaxxed the PAT that leaked cuz of the vuln and </em><em> on sight, no cap.

Here's how:</p><h3>Detect and block unauthorized outbound calls with Harden-Runner</h3><p>The common thread across all 5 attacks was a  call to  from inside a CI runner. <a href=\"https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner\" target=\"_blank\">StepSecurity Harden-Runner</a> monitors all outbound network traffic from GitHub Actions runners in real time. It maintains an allowlist of expected endpoints and can <strong>detect and block calls to unauthorized destinations</strong> — like the attacker's C2 domain.</p><p>In the awesome-go attack, the payload exfiltrated a  to . With Harden-Runner's network egress policy, that call would have been blocked before the token ever left the runner. Even if an attacker achieves code execution, Harden-Runner prevents the payload from phoning home, downloading second-stage scripts, or exfiltrating secrets.</p><p>This is the same detection capability that caught two of the largest CI/CD supply chain attacks in recent history:</p><h3>Prevent Pwn Requests and script injection before they ship</h3><p>Three of the five attacks exploited  with untrusted checkout (the classic \"Pwn Request\"), and two exploited script injection via unsanitized  expressions in shell contexts. These are patterns that can be caught statically.</p><p>StepSecurity provides <strong>GitHub checks and controls that flag vulnerable workflow patterns</strong> — including  combined with  at the PR head ref,  triggers without  gates, and  expression injection in  blocks. These checks run automatically on pull requests, catching dangerous patterns before they reach your default branch. </p><h3>Enforce minimum token permissions</h3><p>In the awesome-go attack, the workflow ran with  and  — far more than a quality check script needs. The exfiltrated token gave the attacker the ability to push code and merge PRs.</p><p>StepSecurity helps you <strong>set and enforce minimum  permissions</strong> across all your workflows. It analyzes what each workflow actually does and recommends the least-privilege permission set. By restricting tokens to  where write access isn't needed, you limit the blast radius of any compromise. Even if an attacker achieves code execution, a read-only token can't push commits or merge pull requests.</p><p>The hackerbot-claw campaign shows that CI/CD attacks are no longer theoretical. Autonomous bots are actively scanning for and exploiting workflow misconfigurations in the wild.

Now, the updated support schedule for the currently active LTS kernels looks like this: \n — Linux 6.6 now EOLs Dec 2027 (was Dec 2026), giving it a 4-year support window. \n\n — Linux 6.12 now EOLs Dec 2028 (was Dec 2026), also a 4-year window. \n\n — Linux 6.18 now EOLs Dec 2028 (was Dec 2027), at least 3 years of support. \n\nWorth noting above is that Linux 5.10 and 5.15 are both hitting EOL this year in December, so if your distro is still running either of these, now is a good time to start thinking about a move.\n","contentLength":956,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Flightradar24 for Ships","url":"https://atlas.flexport.com/","date":1772362877,"author":"chromy","guid":125,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47205637"},{"title":"Lognhorn engine V2 - stability","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1rhu1n9/lognhorn_engine_v2_stability/","date":1772360999,"author":"/u/loststick08","guid":541,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Does anyone have experiences (longer-term) with Longhorn V2 Engine?

The script contains the algorithm that powers LLMs like ChatGPT.</p><p>Let's walk through it piece by piece and watch each part work. <a href=\"https://karpathy.github.io/2026/02/12/microgpt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Andrej did a walkthrough on his blog</a>, but here I take a more visual approach, tailored for beginners.</p><p>The model trains on 32,000 human names, one per line: emma, olivia, ava, isabella, sophia... Each name is a document. The model's job is to learn the statistical patterns in these names and generate plausible new ones that sound like they could be real.</p><p>By the end of training, the model produces names like \"kamon\", \"karai\", \"anna\", and \"anton\".The model has learned which characters tend to follow which, which sounds are common at the start vs. the end, and how long a typical name runs. From ChatGPT's perspective, your conversation is just a document. When you type a prompt, the model's response is a statistical document completion.</p><p>Neural networks work with numbers, not characters. So we need a way to convert text into a sequence of integers and back. The simplest possible tokenizer assigns one integer to each unique character in the dataset. The 26 lowercase letters get ids 0 through 25, and we add one special token called BOS (Beginning of Sequence) with id 26 that marks where a name starts and ends.</p><p>Type a name below and watch it get tokenized. Each character maps to its integer id, and BOS tokens wrap both ends:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"124\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 124\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>The integer values themselves have no meaning. Token 4 isn't \"more\" than token 2. Each token is just a distinct symbol, like assigning a different color to each letter. Production tokenizers like tiktoken (used by GPT-4) work on chunks of characters for efficiency, giving a vocabulary of ~100,000 tokens, but the principle is the same.</p></div><p>Here's the core task: given the tokens we've seen so far, predict what comes next. We slide through the sequence one position at a time. At position 0, the model sees only BOS and must predict the first letter. At position 1, it sees BOS and the first letter and must predict the second letter. And so on.</p><p>Step through the sequence below and watch the context grow while the target shifts forward:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"104\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 104\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><p>Each step produces one training example: the context on the left is the input, the green token on the right is what the model should predict. For the name \"emma\", that's five input-target pairs. This sliding window is how all language models train, including ChatGPT.</p><h2></h2><p>At each position, the model outputs 27 raw numbers, one per possible next token. These numbers (called ) can be anything: positive, negative, large, small. We need to convert them into probabilities that are positive and sum to 1.  does this by exponentiating each score and dividing by the total.</p><p>Adjust the logits below and watch the probability distribution change. Notice how one large logit dominates, and the exponential amplifies differences.</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"192\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 192\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><p>Here's the actual softmax code from microgpt. Step through it to see the intermediate values at each line:</p><div><div><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 240 144\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div></div></div><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>The subtraction of the max value before exponentiating doesn't change the result mathematically (dividing numerator and denominator by the same constant cancels out) but prevents overflow. Without it,  would produce infinity.</p></div><p>How wrong was the prediction? We need a single number that captures \"the model thought the correct answer was unlikely.\" If the model assigns probability 0.9 to the correct next token, the loss is low (0.1). If it assigns probability 0.01, the loss is high (4.6). The formula is  where  is the probability the model assigned to the correct token. This is called .</p><p>Drag the slider to adjust the probability of the correct token and watch the loss change:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 200\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><p>The curve has two properties that make it useful. First, it's zero when the model is perfectly confident in the right answer (). Second, it goes to infinity as the model assigns near-zero probability to the truth (), which punishes confident wrong answers severely. Training minimizes this number.</p><h2></h2><p>To improve, the model needs to answer: \"for each of my 4,192 , if I nudge it up by a tiny amount, does the loss go up or down, and by how much?\"  computes this by walking the computation backward, applying the  at each step.</p><p>Every mathematical operation (add, multiply, exp, log) is a node in a graph. Each node remembers its inputs and knows its local derivative. The backward pass starts at the loss (where the  is trivially 1.0) and multiplies local derivatives along every path back to the inputs.</p><p>Step through the forward pass, then the backward pass for a small example where  with :</p><p>Now step through the actual  class code. Watch how each operation records its children and local gradients, then how  walks the graph in reverse, accumulating gradients:</p><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>Notice that  has a gradient of 4.0, not 3.0. That's because  is used in two places: once in the multiplication () and once in the addition (). The gradients from both paths sum up: . This is the multivariable chain rule in action. If a value contributes to the loss through multiple paths, the total derivative is the sum of contributions from each path.</p><p>This is the same algorithm that PyTorch's  runs, operating on scalars instead of tensors.</p></div><p>We know how to measure error and how to trace that error back to every parameter. Now let's build the model itself, starting with how it represents tokens.</p><p>A raw token id like 4 is just an index. The model can't do math with a bare integer. So each token looks up a learned vector (a list of 16 numbers) from an  table. Think of it as each token having a 16-dimensional \"personality\" that the model can adjust during training.</p><p>Position matters too. The letter \"a\" at position 0 plays a different role than \"a\" at position 4. So there's a second embedding table indexed by position. The token embedding and position embedding are added together to form the input to the rest of the network.</p><p>Click a token below to see its embedding vectors and how they combine:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 200\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>The embedding values start as small random numbers and get tuned during training. After training, tokens that behave similarly (like vowels) tend to end up with similar embedding vectors. The model learns these representations from scratch, with no prior knowledge of what a vowel is.</p></div><h2></h2><p>This is how  work. At each position, the model needs to gather information from previous positions. It does this through : each token produces three vectors from its embedding.</p><p>A  (\"what am I looking for?\"), a  (\"what do I contain?\"), and a  (\"what information do I offer if selected?\"). The query at the current position is compared against all keys from previous positions via . High dot product means high relevance. Softmax converts these scores into attention weights, and the weighted sum of values is the output.</p><p>Explore the attention weights below. Each cell shows how much one position attends to another. Switch between the four attention heads to see different patterns:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"334\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 334\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>The gray region in the upper-right is the causal mask. Position 2 can't attend to position 4 because position 4 hasn't happened yet. This is what makes the model : each position only sees the past.</p><p>Different heads learn different patterns. One head might attend strongly to the most recent token. Another might focus on the BOS token (to remember \"we're generating a name\"). A third might look for vowels. The four heads run in parallel, each operating on a 4-dimensional slice of the 16-dimensional embedding, and their outputs are concatenated and projected back to 16 dimensions.</p></div><p>The model pipes each token through: embed, normalize, attend, add , normalize, MLP, add residual, project to output logits. The  (multilayer perceptron) is a two-layer feed-forward network: project up to 64 dimensions, apply  (zero out negatives), project back to 16. If attention is how tokens communicate, the MLP is where each position thinks independently.</p><p>Step through the pipeline for one token and watch data flow through each stage:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 120\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><p>Here's the actual  function from microgpt. Step through to see the code executing line by line, with the intermediate vector at each stage:</p><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>The residual connections (the \"Add\" steps) are load-bearing. Without them, gradients would shrink to near-zero by the time they reach the early layers, and training would stall. The residual connection gives gradients a shortcut, which is why deep networks can train at all.</p><p>RMSNorm (root-mean-square normalization) rescales each vector to have unit root-mean-square. This prevents activations from growing or shrinking as they pass through the network, which stabilizes training. GPT-2 used LayerNorm; RMSNorm is simpler and works just as well.</p></div><p>The training loop repeats 1,000 times: pick a name, tokenize it, run the model forward over every position, compute the cross-entropy loss at each position, average the losses, backpropagate to get gradients for every parameter, and update the parameters to make the loss a bit lower.</p><p>The optimizer is Adam, which is smarter than naive gradient descent. It maintains a running average of each parameter's recent gradients (momentum) and a running average of the squared gradients (adaptive ). Parameters that have been getting consistent gradients take larger steps. Parameters that have been oscillating take smaller ones.</p><p>Watch the loss decrease over 1,000 training steps. The model starts at ~3.3 (random guessing among 27 tokens: ) and settles around 2.37. The generated names evolve from gibberish to plausible:</p><div><div><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 180\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div></div></div><p>Step through the code for one complete training iteration. Watch it pick a name, run the forward pass at each position, compute the loss, run backward, and update the parameters:</p><p>Once training is done,  is straightforward. Start with BOS, run the forward pass, get 27 probabilities, randomly sample one token, feed it back in, and repeat until the model outputs BOS again (meaning \"I'm done\") or we hit the maximum length.</p><p>Temperature controls how we sample. Before softmax, we divide the logits by the temperature. A temperature of 1.0 samples directly from the learned distribution. Lower temperatures sharpen the distribution (the model picks its top choices more often). Higher temperatures flatten it (more diverse but potentially less coherent output).</p><p>Adjust the temperature and watch the probability distribution change:</p><div><div><svg width=\"100%\" height=\"164\" viewBox=\"0 0 420 164\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" font-family=\"ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, &quot;SF Mono&quot;, Menlo, Consolas, monospace\"></svg></div></div><p>Step through the inference loop to see a name being generated character by character. At each step, the model runs forward, produces probabilities, and samples the next token:</p><div data-presentation-hide=\"\"><p>A temperature approaching 0 would always pick the highest-probability token (greedy decoding). This produces the most \"average\" output. A temperature of 1.0 matches what the model actually learned. Values above 1.0 inject extra randomness, which can produce creative outputs but also nonsense. The sweet spot for names is around 0.5.</p></div><h2></h2><p>This 200-line script contains the complete algorithm. Between this and ChatGPT, litte changes conceptually.

Hundreds of billions of parameters instead of 4,192. Hundreds of layers instead of one. Training across thousands of GPUs for months.</p><p>But the loop is the same.

You will learn the basics of supervised machine learning, large language models, and post-training.

Homeworks are submitted using <a href=\"https://mugrade.org\">mugrade</a> system (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jrtb9y6xg6U\">tutorial video</a>). Some assignments build on previous ones, though for the in-class CMu version we'll distribute solutions to help you work through any errors that may have cropped up in previous assignments (for the online version, we'd suggest talking to others who were able to complete the assignment). In addition to the (main) programming aspect, some homeworks may contain  shorter written portion that works out some of the mathematical details behind the approach.\n  </p><p>\n    All homeworks are released as Colab notebooks, at the links below.  We are also releasing <a href=\"https://marimo.io/\">Marimo</a> notebook versions.  The mugrade version of the online assignment will be available two weeks after the release dates for the CMU course.\n  </p><p>\n    Each homework will be accompanied by an in-class (15 minute) quiz that assesses basic questions based upon the assignment. This will include replicating (at a high level) some of the code you wrote for the assignment, or answering conceptual questions about the assignment. All quizzes are closed book and closed notes.\n  </p><p>\n    In addition to the homework quizzes, there will be 3 in-person exams, two midterms and a final (during finals period). The midterms will focus on material only covered during that section of the courses, while the final will be cumulative (but with an emphasis on the last third of the course). All midterms and final and closed book and closed notes.\n  </p><p>\n    Lecture schedule is tentative and will be updated over the course of semester.

You cannot use any such assistants, or any external materials, during in-class evaluations (both the homework quizzes and the midterms and final).\n  </p><p>\n    The rationale behind this policy is a simple one: AI can be extremely helpful as a learning tool (and to be clear, as an actual implementation tool), but over-reliance on these systems can currently be a detriment to learning in many cases. You  need to learn how to code and do other tasks using AI tools, but turning in AI-generated solutions for the relatively short assignments we give you can (at least in our current experience) ultimately lead to substantially less understanding of the material. The choice is yours on assignments, but we believe that you will ultimately perform much better on the in-class quizzes and exams if you do work through your final submitted homework solutions yourself.\n  </p>","contentLength":6211,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47204559"},{"title":"300+ Engineering Articles to Level Up Your System Design Skills","url":"https://blog.algomaster.io/p/300-engineering-articles-to-level-up-system-design","date":1772340064,"author":"Ashish Pratap Singh","guid":744,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I’m excited to share a  where I’ve curated 300+ high-quality engineering articles, organized by top tech companies.</p><p>These articles cover various topics including:</p><ul><li><p>Real-World System Design and Architecture</p></li><li><p>Databases and Performance</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure and Security</p></li></ul><p>A lot of people tell you which engineering blogs to follow.

The Israeli military said its forces killed Khamenei. The Iranian government confirmed the supreme leader's death and announced 40 days of mourning.</p><p>During his 36-year rule, Khamenei was unwavering in his steadfast antipathy to the U.S. and Israel and to any efforts to reform and bring Iran into the 21st century.</p><p>Khamenei was born in July 1939 into a religious family in the Shia Muslim holy city of Mashhad in northeastern Iran and attended theological school. An outspoken opponent of the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khamenei was arrested several times.</p><p>He was surrounded by other Iranian activists, including Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who became Iran's first supreme leader following the country's Islamic Revolution in the late 1970s.</p><p>Khamenei survived an assassination attempt in 1981 that cost him the use of his right arm.

Iran's economy was crumbling, due in large part to stringent Western sanctions, fueling more unrest.</p><p>In 2013, Khamenei agreed to secret negotiations with the U.S. about Iran's nuclear program, which eventually led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear agreement. Vaez says Khamenei deeply distrusted the U.S. and was skeptical about the deal.</p><p>\"His argument has always been that the U.S. is always looking for pretexts, for putting pressure on Iran,\" he says. \"And if Iran concedes on the nuclear issue, then the U.S. would put pressure on Iran because of its missiles program or because of human rights violations or because of its regional policies.\"</p><p>President Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal during his first term in office gave some credence to Khamenei's cynicism. Analysts say Iran increased its nuclear enrichment after that to a point where it was close to being able to build a bomb.</p><p>In early 2025, when Trump reached out to Iran about a new deal, Khamenei dragged out negotiations until they began in mid-April.</p><p>But time ran out. In June,Israel made good on its threat to neutralize Iran's nuclear program, launching strikes on key facilities and killing scientists and generals. Iran retaliated, and the two sides exchanged several days of missile strikes.</p><p>On June 21, 2025, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/21/nx-s1-5441127/iran-us-strike-nuclear-trump\" target=\"_blank\">launched major airstrikes</a> on three of Iran's nuclear enrichment sites.

Neoliberal capitalism has hollowed out democratic institutions and concentrated power in a transnational “authoritarian international” of billionaires, security chiefs, and political fixers who monetize state power while shielding one another from accountability. At the same time, Big Tech platforms have become neo‑feudal estates that extract rent from our data and behavior, weaponize disinformation, and provide the surveillance backbone of an emerging global police state.</p><p>Drawing on the work of Robert Reich, William I. Robinson, Yanis Varoufakis, and others, alongside historian Heather Cox Richardson’s detailed account of Trump‑era patronage, whistleblower suppression, and DHS/ICE mega‑detention plans, the essay contends that America is rapidly constructing a system of concentration‑camp infrastructure and paramilitary policing designed to manage “surplus” populations and political dissent. Elite impunity, entrenched through national‑security exceptionalism, legal immunities, and revolving‑door careers, means that those directing lawless violence face virtually no consequences. Elections still happen, courts still sit, newspapers still publish, but substantive power is increasingly exercised by unelected oligarchs, tech lords, and security bureaucracies.</p><p>This authoritarian drift cannot be separated from the broader crisis of industrial civilization. Ecological overshoot, climate chaos, resource constraints, and structural economic stagnation have undermined the promise of endless growth on which liberal democracy once rested. Rather than using the remnants of industrial wealth to democratize a just transition, ruling elites are hardening borders, expanding carceral infrastructure, and building a security regime to contain “surplus” humanity in a world of shrinking energy and material throughput. America’s oligarchic techno‑feudal fascism is thus not an anomaly, but one plausible endgame of industrial civilization: a stratified order of gated enclaves above and camps and precarity below, designed to preserve elite power as the old industrial world comes apart.</p><p><strong>I. From liberal promise to oligarchic capture</strong></p><p>The American republic was founded on a promise that power would be divided, constrained, and answerable: a written constitution, separated branches, periodic elections, and a Bill of Rights that set bright lines even the sovereign could not cross. That promise was always compromised by slavery, settler colonialism, and gendered exclusion, but it retained real, if uneven, force as a normative horizon. What has shifted over the past half‑century is not simply the familiar gap between creed and practice, but the underlying structure of the system itself: the center of gravity has moved from public institutions toward a private oligarchy whose wealth and leverage allow it to function as a parallel sovereign.</p><p>The neoliberal turn of the 1970s and 1980s marked the decisive inflection point. Deregulation, financial liberalization, the crushing of organized labor, and the privatization of public goods redistributed power and income upward on a historic scale. Trade liberalization and capital mobility allowed corporations and investors to pit governments and workers against one another, extracting subsidies and tax concessions under the permanent threat of capital flight. At the same time, Supreme Court decisions eroded limits on political spending, redefining “speech” as something that could be purchased in unlimited quantities by those with the means.</p><p>The result, as Robert Reich notes, has been the consolidation of an American oligarchy that “paved the road to fascism” by ensuring that public policy reflects donor preferences far more consistently than popular majorities. In issue after issue, such as taxation, labor law, healthcare, and environmental regulation, there is a clear skew: the wealthy get what they want more often than not, while broadly popular but redistributive policies routinely die in committee or are gutted beyond recognition. This is not a conspiracy in the melodramatic sense; it is how the wiring of the system now works.</p><p>William Robinson’s analysis of “twenty‑first‑century fascism” sharpens the point. Global capitalism in its current form generates chronic crises: overproduction, under‑consumption, ecological breakdown, and a growing population that capital cannot profitably employ. Under such conditions, democratic politics becomes dangerous for elites, because electorates might choose structural reforms such as wealth taxes, public ownership, strong unions, and Green New Deal‑style transitions that would curb profits. Faced with this prospect, segments of transnational capital begin to see authoritarian solutions as rational: better to hollow out democracy, harden borders, and construct a global police state than to accept serious redistribution.</p><p>American politics in the early twenty‑first century fits this pattern with unsettling precision. A decaying infrastructure, stagnant wages, ballooning personal debt, militarized policing, and permanent war have produced widespread disillusionment. As faith in institutions erodes, public life is flooded with resentment and nihilism that can be redirected against scapegoats (immigrants, racial minorities, feminists, and queer and trans people) rather than against the oligarchic‑power‑complex that profits from the decay. It is in this vacuum that a figure like Donald Trump thrives: a billionaire demagogue able to channel anger away from the class that actually governs and toward those even more marginalized.</p><p>The decisive shift from plutocratic dysfunction to fascist danger occurs when oligarchs cease to see constitutional democracy as even instrumentally useful and instead invest in movements openly committed to minority rule. Koch‑style networks, Mercer‑funded operations, and Silicon Valley donors willing to underwrite hard‑right projects are not supporting democracy‑enhancing reforms; they are building the infrastructure for authoritarianism, from voter suppression to ideological media to data‑driven propaganda. The system that emerges is hybrid: elections still occur, courts still sit, newspapers still publish, but substantive power is increasingly concentrated in unelected hands.</p><p><strong>II. The “authoritarian international” and the shadow world of deals</strong></p><p>Historian Heather Cox Richardson’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajZudGu4exA\">recent analysis</a> captures a formation that much mainstream commentary still struggles to name: a transnational <strong>“authoritarian international”</strong> in which oligarchs, political operatives, royal families, security chiefs, and organized criminals cooperate to monetize state power while protecting one another from scrutiny. This is not a formal alliance; it is an overlapping ecology of relationships, exclusive vacations, investment vehicles, shell companies, foundations, and intelligence ties, through which information, favors, and money flow.</p><p>The key is that this network is structurally post‑ideological. As Robert Mueller warned in his 2011 description of an emerging “iron triangle” of politicians, businesspeople, and criminals, these actors are not primarily concerned with religion, nationality, or traditional ideology. They will work across confessional and national lines so long as the deals are lucrative and risk is manageably socialized onto others. Saudi royals invest alongside Western hedge funds; Russian oligarchs launder money through London property and American private equity; Israeli and Emirati firms collaborate with U.S. tech companies on surveillance products that are then sold worldwide.</p><p>Within this milieu, the formal distinction between public office and private interest blurs. Richardson’s analysis of Donald Trump’s abrupt reversal on the Gordie Howe International Bridge after a complaint by a billionaire competitor with ties to Jeffrey Epstein—reads less like the exercise of public policy judgment and more like feudal patronage: the sovereign intervenes to protect a favored lord’s toll road. Tiny shifts in regulatory posture or federal support can move billions of dollars; for those accustomed to having the president’s ear, such interventions are simply part of doing business.</p><p>The same logic governs foreign policy. The Trump‑Kushner axis exemplifies this fusion of public and private. When a whistleblower alleges that the Director of National Intelligence suppressed an intercept involving foreign officials discussing Jared Kushner and sensitive topics like Iran, and when the complaint is then choked off with aggressive redaction and executive privilege, we see <strong>the machinery of secrecy misused not to protect the national interest but to shield a member of the family‑cum‑business empire at the center of power</strong>. It is as if the state has become a family office with nuclear weapons.</p><p>Josh Marshall’s phrase <strong>“authoritarian international”</strong> is apt because it names both the class composition and the political function of this network. The same names recur across far‑right projects: donors and strategists who back nationalist parties in Europe, ultras in Latin America, Modi’s BJP in India, and the MAGA movement in the United States. Their interests are not identical, but they overlap around a shared agenda: weakening labor and environmental protections, undermining independent media and courts, militarizing borders, and securing immunity for themselves and their peers.</p><p>This world is lubricated by blackmail and mutually assured destruction. As Richardson notes, players often seem to hold compromising material on one another, whether in the form of documented sexual abuse, financial crime, or war crimes. This shared vulnerability paradoxically stabilizes the network: as long as everyone has something on everyone else, defection is dangerous, and a predatory equilibrium holds. From the standpoint of democratic publics, however, this stability is catastrophic, because it means that scandal—once a mechanism for enforcing norms—loses much of its power. When “everyone is dirty,” no one can be clean enough to prosecute the others without risking exposure.</p><p><strong>III. Techno‑feudal aristocracy and the colonization of everyday life</strong></p><p>Layered atop this transnational oligarchy is the digital order that Varoufakis and others describe as techno‑feudalism: a regime in which a handful of platforms function like neo‑feudal estates, extracting rent from their “serfs” (users, gig workers, content creators) rather than competing in open markets. This shift is more than metaphor. In classical capitalism, firms profited primarily by producing goods or services and selling them on markets where competitors could, in principle, undercut them. In the platform order, gatekeepers profit by controlling access to the marketplace itself, imposing opaque terms on those who must use their infrastructure to communicate, work, or even find housing.</p><p>This can be seen across sectors:</p><ul><li><p>Social media platforms own the digital public square. They monetize attention by selling advertisers access to finely sliced demographic and psychographic segments, while their recommendation algorithms optimize for engagement, often by privileging outrage and fear.</p></li><li><p>Ride‑hailing and delivery apps control the interface between customers and labor, setting prices unilaterally and disciplining workers through ratings, algorithmic management, and the ever‑present threat of “deactivation.”</p></li><li><p>Cloud providers and app stores gatekeep access to the basic infrastructure upon which countless smaller firms depend, taking a cut of transactions and reserving the right to change terms or remove competitors from the ecosystem entirely.</p></li></ul><p>In each case, the platform is less a company among companies and more a landlord among tenants, collecting tolls for the right to exist within its domain. Users produce the very capital stock, data, content, behavioral profiles, that platforms own and monetize, yet they have little say over how this material is used or how the digital environment is structured. The asymmetry of power is profound: the lords can alter the code of the world; the serfs can, at best, adjust their behavior to avoid algorithmic invisibility or sanction.</p><p>For authoritarian politics, this structure is a gift. First, platforms have become the primary vectors of disinformation and propaganda. Cambridge Analytica’s work for Trump in 2016, funded by billionaires like the Mercers, was an early prototype: harvest data, micro‑target individuals with tailored&nbsp;messaging, and flood their feeds with narratives designed to activate fear and resentment. Since then, the techniques have grown more sophisticated, and far‑right movements worldwide have learned to weaponize meme culture, conspiracy theories, and “shitposting” as recruitment tools.</p><p>Second, the same infrastructures that enable targeted advertising enable granular surveillance. Location data, social graphs, search histories, and facial‑recognition databases provide an unprecedented toolkit for monitoring and disciplining populations. In the hands of a regime sliding toward fascism, these tools can be turned against dissidents with terrifying efficiency: geofencing protests to identify attendees, scraping social media to build dossiers, using AI to flag “pre‑criminal” behavior. The emerging “global police state” that Robinson describes depends heavily on such techno‑feudal capacities.</p><p>Third, the digital order corrodes the very preconditions for democratic deliberation. Information overload, filter bubbles, and algorithmic amplification of sensational content produce a public sphere saturated with noise. Under these conditions, truth becomes just another aesthetic, and the distinction between fact and fiction collapses into vibes. This is the post‑modern nihilism you name: a sense that nothing is stable enough to believe in, that everything is spin. Fascist movements do not seek to resolve this condition; they weaponize it, insisting that only the Leader and his trusted media tell the real truth, while everything else is a hostile lie.</p><p>Finally, the techno‑feudal aristocracy’s material interests align with authoritarianism. Privacy regulations, antitrust enforcement, data localization rules, and strong labor rights all threaten platform profits. Democratic movements that demand such reforms are therefore adversaries. Conversely, strongman leaders who promise deregulation, tax breaks, and law‑and‑order crackdowns, even if they occasionally threaten specific firms, are often acceptable partners. The result is a convergence: oligarchs of data and oligarchs of oil, real estate, and finance finding common cause in an order that disciplines the many and exempts the few.</p><p><strong>IV. Elite impunity and the machinery of lawlessness</strong></p><p>Authoritarianism is not only about who holds power; it is about who is answerable for wrongdoing. A system where elites can violate laws with impunity while ordinary people are punished harshly for minor infractions is already halfway to fascism, whatever labels it wears. The United States has, over recent decades, constructed precisely such a system.</p><p>The Arab Center’s “Machinery of Impunity” report details how, in areas ranging from mass surveillance to foreign wars to domestic policing, senior officials who authorize illegal acts almost never face criminal consequences. Edward Snowden’s revelations exposed systemic violations of privacy and civil liberties, yet it was the whistleblower who faced prosecution and exile, not the architects of the programs. Torture during the “war on terror” was acknowledged, even documented in official reports, but those who designed and approved the torture regime kept their law licenses, academic posts, and media gigs. Lethal strikes on small boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, justified by secret intelligence and shielded by classified legal opinions, have killed dozens with no public evidence that the targets posed imminent threats.</p><p>This pattern is not an aberration but a feature. As a Penn State law review article <a href=\"https://insight.dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1144&amp;context=jlia\">notes</a>, the U.S. legal system builds in multiple layers of protection for high officials: sovereign immunity, state secrets privilege, narrow standing rules, and prosecutorial discretion all combine to make it extraordinarily difficult to hold the powerful to account. Violations of the Hatch Act, campaign‑finance laws, or ethics rules are often treated as technicalities, and when reports do document unlawful behavior, as in the case of Mike Pompeo’s partisan abuse of his diplomatic office, there are “no consequences” beyond mild censure. Jamelle Bouie’s recent video essay for the New York Times drives the point home: America is “bad at accountability” because institutions have been designed and interpreted to favor elite impunity.</p><p>Richardson shows how this culture functions inside the national‑security state. A whistleblower complaint alleging that the Director of National Intelligence suppressed an intelligence intercept involving Jared Kushner and foreign officials was not allowed to run its course. Instead, it was bottled up, then transmitted to congressional overseers in a highly redacted form, with executive privilege invoked to shield the president’s involvement. The same mechanisms that insulate covert operations abroad from democratic oversight are deployed to protect domestic political allies from scrutiny.</p><p>Immigration enforcement offers another window. The Arab Center notes that ICE raids, family separation, and other abuses “escalated under the current Trump administration into highly visible kidnappings, abuse, and deportations” with little accountability for senior officials. The National Immigrant Justice Center documents a detention system where 90 percent of detainees are held in for‑profit facilities, where medical neglect, punitive solitary confinement, and preventable deaths are common, yet contracts are renewed and expanded. A culture of impunity allows agents and managers to treat rights violations not as career‑ending scandals but as acceptable collateral damage.</p><p>Latin American scholars of impunity warn that such selective enforcement produces a “quiet crisis of accountability” in which the rule of law is hollowed out from within. Laws remain on the books, but their application is skewed: harsh on the poor and marginalized, permissive toward the powerful. Over time, this normalizes the idea that some people are above the law, while others exist primarily as objects of control. When a polity internalizes this hierarchy, fascism no longer needs to arrive in jackboots; it is already present in the daily operations of the justice system.</p><p>The danger, as the Arab Center emphasizes, is that the costs of impunity “come home to roost.” Powers originally justified as necessary to fight terrorism or foreign enemies migrate back into domestic politics. Surveillance tools built for foreign intelligence monitoring are turned on activists and journalists; militarized police tactics perfected in occupied territories are imported into American streets. A population taught to accept lawless violence against outsiders (migrants, foreigners, enemy populations) is gradually conditioned to accept similar violence against internal opponents.</p><p><strong>V. Concentration camps, paramilitary policing, and ritualized predatory violence</strong></p><p>In this context of oligarchic capture, techno‑feudal control, and elite impunity, the rapid expansion of detention infrastructure and the deployment of paramilitary “federal agents” across the interior United States are not aberrations; they are central pillars of an emergent fascist order.</p><p>Richardson’s insistence on calling these facilities concentration camps is analytically exact. A concentration camp, in the historical sense, is not necessarily a death camp; it is a place where a state concentrates populations it considers threats or burdens, subjecting them to confinement, disease, abuse, and often death through neglect rather than industrialized extermination. By that definition, the sprawling network of ICE and Border Patrol detention centers, where people are warehoused for months to years, often in horrific conditions, qualifies.</p><p>New reporting details how this system is poised to scale up dramatically. An internal ICE memo, recently surfaced, outlines a $38 billion plan for a “new detention center model” that would, in one year, create capacity for roughly 92,600 people by purchasing eight “mega centers,” 16 processing centers, and 10 additional facilities. The largest of these warehouses would hold between 7,000 and 10,000 people each for average stays of about 60 days, more than double the size of the largest current federal prison. Separate reporting has mapped at least 23 industrial warehouses being surveyed for conversion into mass detention camps, with leases already secured at several sites.</p><p>Investigations by Amnesty International and others into prototype facilities have found detainees shackled in overcrowded cages, underfed, forced to use open‑air toilets that flood, and routinely denied medical care. Sexual assault and extortion by guards, negligent deaths, and at least one homicide have been documented. These are not accidents; they are predictable outcomes of a profit‑driven system where private contractors are paid per bed and oversight is weak, and of a political culture that dehumanizes migrants as “invaders” or “animals.”</p><p>Richardson highlights another crucial dimension: the way DHS has been retooled to project this violence into the interior as a form of political terror. Agents from ICE and Border Patrol, subdivisions of a relatively new department lacking the institutional restraints of the military, have been deployed in cities far from any border, often in unmarked vehicles, wearing masks and lacking visible identification. Secret legal memos under Trump gutted the traditional requirement of a judicial warrant for entering homes, replacing it with internal sign‑off by another DHS official, a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p><p>This matters both instrumentally and symbolically. Instrumentally, it enables efficient mass raids and “snatch and grab” operations that bypass local law‑enforcement norms and judicial oversight. Symbolically, it communicates that the state reserves the right to operate as a lawless force, unconstrained by the very constitution it claims to defend. When masked, unidentified agents can seize people off the streets, shove them into unmarked vans, and deposit them in processing centers without due process, the aesthetic of fascism…thugs in the night…becomes reality.</p><p>Richardson rightly connects this to the post‑Reconstruction South, where paramilitary groups like the Ku Klux Klan, often tolerated or quietly aided by local officials, used terror to destroy a biracial democracy that had briefly flourished. Today’s difference is that communications technology allows rapid mobilization of witnesses and counter‑protesters: people can rush to the scene when agents arrive, document abuses on smartphones, and coordinate legal support. Yet even this can be folded into the logic of spectacle. The images of militarized agents confronting crowds under the glow of streetlights and police floodlamps serve as warnings: this is what happens when you resist.</p><p>The planned network of processing centers and mega‑warehouses adds another layer of menace. As Richardson points out, if the stated goal is deportation, there is no clear need for facilities capable of imprisoning tens of thousands for months. Part of the answer is coercive leverage: detained people are easier to pressure into abandoning asylum claims and accepting removal, especially when they are told, day after day, that they could walk free if they “just sign.” But the architecture also anticipates a future in which new categories of internal enemies, protesters, “Antifa,” “domestic extremists,” can be funneled into the same carceral estate once migrant flows diminish or political needs change.</p><p>Economically, the camps generate their own constituency. ICE and DHS tout job creation numbers to local officials, promising hundreds of stable, often union‑free positions in communities hollowed out by deindustrialization. Private prison firms and construction companies see lucrative contracts; investors see secure returns backed by federal guarantees. A web of stakeholders thus becomes materially invested in the continuation and expansion of mass detention. <strong>This is techno‑feudalism in concrete and razor wire: a carceral estate in which bodies are the rent‑producing asset.</strong></p><p>Once such an estate exists, its logic tends to spread. Border‑style tactics migrate into ordinary policing; surveillance tools trialed on migrants are turned on domestic movements; legal doctrines crafted to justify raids and warrantless searches in the name of immigration control seep into other domains. The fascist gradient steepens: more people find themselves at risk of sudden disappearance into a system where rights are theoretical and violence is routine.</p>","contentLength":25529,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47198912"},{"title":"The whole thing was a scam","url":"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-whole-thing-was-scam","date":1772297509,"author":"guilamu","guid":151,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47197505"},{"title":"Obsidian Sync now has a headless client","url":"https://help.obsidian.md/sync/headless","date":1772296313,"author":"adilmoujahid","guid":150,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47197267"},{"title":"Cognitive Debt: When Velocity Exceeds Comprehension","url":"https://www.rockoder.com/beyondthecode/cognitive-debt-when-velocity-exceeds-comprehension/","date":1772293150,"author":"pagade","guid":149,"unread":true,"content":"<img src=\"https://www.rockoder.com/images/beyondthecode/cognitive-debt-hero.svg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\"><p>The engineer shipped seven features in a single sprint. DORA metrics looked immaculate. The promotion packet practically wrote itself.</p><p>Six months later, an architectural change required modifying those features. No one on the team could explain why certain components existed or how they interacted. The engineer who built them stared at her own code like a stranger’s.</p><p><strong>Code has become cheaper to produce than to perceive.</strong></p><p>When an engineer writes code manually, two parallel processes occur. The first is production: characters appear in files, tests get written, systems change. The second is absorption: mental models form, edge cases become intuitive, architectural relationships solidify into understanding. These processes are coupled. The act of typing forces engagement. The friction of implementation creates space for reasoning.</p><p>AI-assisted development decouples these processes. A prompt generates hundreds of lines in seconds. The engineer reviews, adjusts, iterates. Output accelerates. But absorption cannot accelerate proportionally. The cognitive work of truly understanding what was built, why it was built that way, and how it relates to everything else remains bounded by human processing speed.</p><p><strong>This gap between output velocity and comprehension velocity is cognitive debt.</strong></p><p>Unlike technical debt, which surfaces through system failures or maintenance costs, <strong>cognitive debt remains invisible to velocity metrics</strong>. The code works. The tests pass. The features ship. The deficit exists only in the minds of the engineers who built the system, manifesting as uncertainty about their own work.</p><p>The debt is not truly invisible. It eventually appears in reliability metrics: Mean Time to Recovery stretches longer, Change Failure Rate creeps upward. But these are lagging indicators, separated by months from the velocity metrics that drive quarterly decisions. By the time MTTR signals a problem, the comprehension deficit has already compounded.</p><h2>What Organizations Actually Measure</h2><p>Engineering performance systems evolved to measure observable outputs. Story points completed. Features shipped. Commits merged. Review turnaround time. These metrics emerged from an era when output and comprehension were tightly coupled, when shipping something implied understanding something.</p><p>The metrics never measured comprehension directly because comprehension was assumed. An engineer who shipped a feature was presumed to understand that feature. <strong>The presumption held because the production process itself forced understanding.</strong></p><p><strong>That presumption no longer holds.</strong> An engineer can now ship features while maintaining only surface familiarity with their implementation. The features work. The metrics register success. The organizational knowledge that would traditionally accumulate alongside those features simply does not form at the same rate.</p><p>Performance calibration committees see velocity improvements. They do not see comprehension deficits. They cannot, because no artifact of the organizational measurement system captures that dimension.</p><p>The discussion of cognitive debt typically focuses on the engineer who generates code. The more acute problem sits with the engineer who reviews it.</p><p>Code review evolved as a quality gate. A senior engineer examines a junior engineer’s work, catching errors, suggesting improvements, transferring knowledge. The rate-limiting factor was always the junior engineer’s output speed. Senior engineers could review faster than juniors could produce.</p><p>AI-assisted development inverts this relationship. <strong>A junior engineer can now generate code faster than a senior engineer can critically audit it.</strong> The volume of generated code exceeds the bandwidth available for deep review. Something has to give, and typically it is review depth.</p><p>The reviewer faces an impossible choice. Maintain previous review standards and become a bottleneck that negates the velocity gains AI provides. Or approve code at the rate it arrives and hope the tests catch what the review missed. Most choose the latter, often unconsciously, because organizational pressure favors throughput.</p><p>This is where cognitive debt compounds fastest. The author’s comprehension deficit might be recoverable through later engagement with the code. The reviewer’s comprehension deficit propagates: they approved code they do not fully understand, which now carries implicit endorsement. <strong>The organizational assumption that reviewed code is understood code no longer holds.</strong></p><p>Engineers working extensively with AI tools report a specific form of exhaustion that differs from traditional burnout. Traditional burnout emerges from sustained cognitive load, from having too much to hold in mind while solving complex problems. The new pattern emerges from something closer to cognitive disconnection.</p><p>The work happens quickly. Progress is visible. But the engineer experiences a persistent sense of not quite grasping their own output. They can execute, but explanation requires reconstruction. They can modify, but prediction becomes unreliable. The system they built feels slightly foreign even as it functions correctly.</p><p>This creates a distinctive psychological state: <strong>high output combined with low confidence</strong>. Engineers produce more while feeling less certain about what they have produced. In organizations that stack-rank based on visible output, this creates pressure to continue generating despite the growing uncertainty.</p><p>The engineer who pauses to deeply understand what they built falls behind in velocity metrics. The engineer who prioritizes throughput over comprehension meets their quarterly objectives. <strong>The incentive structure selects for the behavior that accelerates cognitive debt accumulation.</strong></p><h2>When Organizational Memory Fails</h2><p>Knowledge in engineering organizations exists in two forms. The first is explicit: documentation, design documents, recorded decisions. The second is tacit: understanding held in the minds of people who built and maintained systems over time. Tacit knowledge cannot be fully externalized because much of it exists as intuition, pattern recognition, and contextual judgment that formed through direct engagement with the work.</p><p>When the people who built a system leave or rotate to new projects, tacit knowledge walks out with them. Organizations traditionally replenished this knowledge through the normal process of engineering work. New engineers building on existing systems developed their own tacit understanding through the friction of implementation.</p><p>AI-assisted development potentially short-circuits this replenishment mechanism. If new engineers can generate working modifications without developing deep comprehension, they never form the tacit knowledge that would traditionally accumulate. <strong>The organization loses knowledge not just through attrition but through insufficient formation.</strong></p><p>This creates a delayed failure mode. The system continues to function. New features continue to ship. But the reservoir of people who truly understand the system gradually depletes. When circumstances eventually require that understanding, when something breaks in an unexpected way or requirements change in a way that demands architectural reasoning, the organization discovers the deficit.</p><p>Three failure modes emerge as cognitive debt accumulates.</p><p>The first involves the reversal of a normally reliable heuristic. Engineers typically trust code that has been in production for years. If it survived that long, it probably works. The longer code exists without causing problems, the more confidence it earns. AI-generated code inverts this pattern. <strong>The longer it remains untouched, the more dangerous it becomes</strong>, because the context window of the humans around it has closed completely. Code that was barely understood when written becomes entirely opaque after the people who wrote it have moved on.</p><blockquote>They are debugging a black box written by a black box.</blockquote><p>The second failure mode surfaces during incidents. An alert fires at 3:00 AM. The on-call engineer opens a system they did not build, generated by tools they did not supervise, documented in ways that assume familiarity they do not possess. <strong>They are debugging a black box written by a black box.</strong> What would have been a ten-minute fix when someone understood the system becomes a four-hour forensic investigation when no one does. Multiply this across enough incidents and the aggregate cost exceeds whatever velocity gains the AI-assisted development provided.</p><blockquote>The organization is effectively trading its pipeline of future Staff Engineers for this quarter's feature delivery.</blockquote><p>The third failure mode operates on a longer timescale. Junior engineers who rely primarily on AI-assisted development never develop the intuition that comes from manual implementation. They ship features without forming the scar tissue that informs architectural judgment. The organization is effectively trading its pipeline of future Staff Engineers for this quarter’s feature delivery. The cost does not appear in current headcount models because the people who would have become senior architects five years from now are not yet absent. </p><p>From the perspective of engineering leadership, AI-assisted development presents as productivity gain. Teams ship faster. Roadmaps compress. Headcount discussions become more favorable. These are the observable signals that propagate upward through organizational reporting structures.</p><p>The cognitive debt accumulating in those teams does not present as a signal. There is no metric for “engineers who can explain their own code without re-reading it.” There is no dashboard for “organizational comprehension depth.” The concept does not fit into quarterly business review formats or headcount justification narratives.</p><p>Directors make decisions based on observable signals. When those signals uniformly indicate success, the decision to double down on the approach that produced those signals is rational within the information environment available to leadership. <strong>The decision is not wrong given the data. The data is incomplete.</strong></p><p>The cognitive debt framing does not apply uniformly across all engineering work. Some tasks genuinely are mechanical. Some codebases genuinely benefit from rapid iteration without deep architectural understanding. Some features genuinely do not require the level of comprehension that would traditionally form through manual implementation.</p><p>The model also assumes that comprehension was previously forming at adequate rates. This assumption may be generous. Engineers have always varied in how deeply they understood their own work. The distribution may simply be shifting rather than a new phenomenon emerging.</p><p>Additionally, tooling and documentation practices may evolve to partially close the comprehension gap. If organizations develop methods for capturing and transmitting the understanding that AI-assisted development fails to form organically, the debt may prove manageable rather than accumulative.</p><blockquote>The system is optimizing correctly for what it measures. What it measures no longer captures what matters.</blockquote><p>The fundamental challenge is that <strong>organizations cannot optimize for what they cannot measure</strong>. Velocity is measurable. Comprehension is not, or at least not through any mechanism that currently feeds into performance evaluation, promotion decisions, or headcount planning.</p><p>Until comprehension becomes legible to organizational decision-making systems, the incentive structure will continue to favor velocity. Engineers who prioritize understanding over output will appear less productive than peers who prioritize output over understanding. Performance calibration will reward the behavior that accumulates debt faster.</p><p>This is not a failure of individual managers or engineers. It is a measurement system designed for an era when production and comprehension were coupled, operating in an era when that coupling no longer holds. <strong>The system is optimizing correctly for what it measures. What it measures no longer captures what matters.</strong></p><p>The gap will eventually manifest. Whether through maintenance costs that exceed projections, through incidents that require understanding no one possesses, or through new requirements that expose the brittleness of systems built without deep comprehension. The timing and form of manifestation remain uncertain. The underlying dynamic does not.</p>","contentLength":12316,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47196582"},{"title":"Addressing Antigravity Bans and Reinstating Access","url":"https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/discussions/20632","date":1772286613,"author":"RyanShook","guid":148,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47195371"},{"title":"OpenAI fires an employee for prediction market insider trading","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-fires-employee-insider-trading-polymarket-kalshi/","date":1772286380,"author":"bookofjoe","guid":147,"unread":true,"content":"<p> an employee following an investigation into their activity on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-political-war-over-prediction-markets-is-just-getting-started/\">prediction market platforms</a> including Polymarket, WIRED has learned.</p><p>OpenAI CEO of Applications, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fidji-simo-is-openais-other-ceo-and-she-swears-shell-make-chatgpt-profitable/#intcid=_wired-verso-hp-trending_ea249350-52ab-42d0-9cfe-e91d580f41e8_popular4-2\">Fidji Simo</a>, disclosed the termination in an internal message to employees earlier this year.

OpenAI has not revealed the name of the employee or the specifics of their trades.</p><p>Evidence suggests that this was not an isolated event. Polymarket runs on the Polygon blockchain network, so its trading ledger is pseudonymous but traceable. According to an analysis by the financial data platform Unusual Whales, there have been clusters of activities, which the service flagged as suspicious, around OpenAI-themed events since March 2023.</p><p>Unusual Whales flagged 77 positions in 60 wallet addresses as suspected insider trades, looking at the age of the account, trading history, and significance of investment, among other factors. Suspicious trades hinged on the release dates of products like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-launches-sora-2-tiktok-like-app/\">Sora</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gpt-5-coding-review-software-engineering/\">GPT-5</a>, and the ChatGPT Browser, as well as CEO Sam Altman’s employment status. In November 2023, two days after Altman was dramatically ousted from the company, a new wallet placed a significant bet that he would return, netting over $16,000 in profits. The account never placed another bet.</p><p>The behavior fits into patterns typical of insider trades. “The tell is the clustering. In the 40 hours before OpenAI launched its browser, 13 brand-new wallets with zero trading history appeared on the site for the first time to collectively bet $309,486 on the right outcome,” says Unusual Whales CEO Matt Saincome. “When you see that many fresh wallets making the same bet at the same time, it raises a real question about whether the secret is getting out.”</p><p>Prediction markets have exploded in popularity in recent years. These platforms allow customers to buy “event contracts” on the outcomes of future events ranging from the winner of the Super Bowl to the daily price of Bitcoin to whether the United States will go to war with Iran. There are a wide array of markets tied to events in the technology sector; you can trade on what Nvidia’s quarterly earnings will be, or when Tesla will launch a new car, or which AI companies will IPO in 2026.</p><p>As the platforms have grown, so have concerns that they allow traders to profit from insider knowledge. “This prediction market world makes the Wild West look tame in comparison,” says Jeff Edelstein, a senior analyst at the betting news site InGame. “If there's a market that exists where the answer is known, somebody's going to trade on it.”</p><p>Earlier this week, Kalshi <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kalshi-insider-trading-california-politician-and-youtuber/\">announced</a> that it had reported several suspicious insider trading cases to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency overseeing these markets. In one instance, an employee of the popular YouTuber Mr. Beast was suspended for two years and fined $20,000 for making trades related to the streamer’s activities; in another, the far-right political candidate Kyle Langford was banned from the platform for making a trade on his own campaign. The company also announced a number of initiatives to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.</p><p>While Kalshi has heavily promoted its crackdown on insider trading, Polymarket has stayed silent on the matter. The company did not return requests for comments.</p><p>In the past, major trades on technology-themed markets have sparked speculation that there are Big Tech employees profiting by using their insider knowledge to gain an edge.

The productivity gains are real, but there are costs that don’t show up on any dashboard.</p><p>Imagine a spectrum. On the far left are humans typing on the keyboard, seeing the code in the IDE. On the far right: AGI. It implements everything on its own. Cheaply, flawlessly, better than any human, and no human overseer is required. Somewhere between those two extremes there’s you, using AI, today. That threshold moves to the right every week as models improve, tools mature, and workflows get refined.</p><blockquote><p>Which is higher risk, using AI too much, or using AI too little?</p></blockquote><p>and it made me think about LLMs for coding differently, especially after reading what other devs share on AI adoption in different workplaces. You can be wrong in both directions, but is the desired amount of AI usage at work changing as the models improve?</p><p>Not long ago the first AI coding tools like Cursor (2023) or Copilot (2022) emerged. They were able to quickly index the codebase using RAG, so they had the local context. They had all the knowledge of the models powering them, so they had an external knowledge of the Internet as well. Googling and browsing StackOverflow wasn’t needed anymore. Cursor gave the users a custom IDE with built in AI powered autocomplete and other baked-in AI tools, like chat, to make the experience coherent.</p><p>Then came the agent promise. MCPs, autonomous workflows, <a href=\"https://michaelxbloch.substack.com/p/no-coding-before-10am\">articles about agents running overnight</a> started to pop up left and right. It was a different use of AI than Cursor. <strong>It was no longer an AI-assisted human coding, but a human-assisted AI coding.</strong></p><p>Many devs tried it and got burned. Agents made tons of small mistakes. The AI-first process required a complete paradigm shift in how devs think about coding, in order to achieve great results. Also, agents often got stuck in loops, hallucinate dependencies, and produced code that looks almost right but isn’t. You needed to learn about a completely new tech, fueled by FOMO. And this new shiny tool never got it 100% right on the first try.</p><p>Software used to be deterministic. You controlled it with if/else branches, explicit state machines, clear logic. The new reality is controlling the development process with prompts, system instructions, and CLAUDE.md files, and hope the model produces the output you expect.</p><blockquote><p>An engineer at Spotify on their morning commute from Slack on their cell phone can tell Claude to fix a bug or add a new feature to the iOS app. And once Claude finishes that work, the engineer then gets a new version of the app, pushed to them on Slack on their phone, so that he can then merge it to production, all before they even arrive at the office.”</p></blockquote><p>I hope they at least review the code before merging.</p><p>The next stage is an (almost) full automation. That’s what many execs want and try to achieve. It’s a capitalistic wet dream, a worker that never sleeps, never gets tired, always wants to work, is infinitely productive. But Geoffrey Hinton predicted in 2016 that deep learning would outperform radiologists at image analysis within five years. Anthropic’s CEO predicted AI would write 90% of code within three to six months of March 2025. None of this happened as predicted. The trajectory is real, but the timeline keeps slipping.</p><p>In 2012, neuroscientist Manfred Spitzer published <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Dementia_(book)\">Digital Dementia</a>, arguing that when we outsource mental tasks to digital devices, the brain pathways responsible for those tasks atrophy. Use it or lose it. Not all of this is proven scientifically, but neuroplasticity research shows the brain strengthens pathways that get used and weakens ones that don’t. The core principle of the book is that the cognitive skills that you stop practicing will decline.</p><p>Margaret-Anne Storey, a software engineering researcher, recently gave this a more precise name: <a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">cognitive debt</a>. Technical debt lives in the code. Cognitive debt lives in developers’ heads. It’s the accumulated loss of understanding that happens when you build fast without comprehending what you built. She grounds it in Peter Naur’s 1985 theory that a program is a theory existing in developers’ minds, capturing what it does, how intentions map to implementation, and how it can evolve. When that theory fragments, the system becomes a black box.</p><p>Apply this directly to fully agentic coding. If you stop writing code and only review AI output, your ability to reason about code atrophies. Slowly, invisibly, but inevitably. You can’t deeply review what you can no longer deeply understand.</p><p>This isn’t just theory. A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245\">2026 randomized study by Shen and Tamkin</a> tested this directly: 52 professional developers learning a new async library were split into AI-assisted and unassisted groups. The AI group scored 17% lower on conceptual understanding, debugging, and code reading. The largest gap was in debugging, the exact skill you need to catch what AI gets wrong. One hour of passive AI-assisted work produced measurable skill erosion.</p><p>The insidious part is that you don’t notice the decline because the tool compensates for it. You feel productive. The PRs are shipping. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow</a> showed that the state of flow depends on a balance between challenge and skill. Your mind needs to be stretched just enough. Real flow produces growth. Rachel Thomas called what AI-assisted work produces <a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/posts/2026-01-28-dark-flow/\">“dark flow”</a>, a term borrowed from gambling research, describing the trance-like state slot machines are designed to induce. You feel absorbed, but the challenge-skill balance is gone because the AI handles the challenge. It feels like the flow state of deep work, but the feedback loop is broken. You’re not getting better, you’re getting dependent.</p><p>There’s this observation that keeps coming up in HN comments: if the AI writes all the code and you only review it, where does the skill to review come from? You can’t have one without the other. You don’t learn to recognize good code by reading about it in a textbook, or a PR. You learn by writing bad code, getting it torn apart, and building intuition through years of practice.</p><p>This creates what I’d call the review paradox: the more AI writes, the less qualified humans become to review what it wrote. The Shen-Tamkin study puts numbers on this. Developers who fully delegated to AI finished tasks fastest but scored worst on evaluations. The novices who benefit most from AI productivity are exactly the ones who need debugging skills to supervise it, and AI erodes those skills first.</p><p>Storey’s proposed fix is simple: “require humans to understand each AI-generated change before deployment.” That’s the right answer. It’s also the one that gets skipped first when velocity is the metric.</p><p>This goes deeper than individual skill decay. We used to have juniors, mids, seniors, staff engineers, architects. It was a pipeline where each level built on years of hands-on struggle. A junior spends years writing code that is rejected during the code review not because they were not careful, but didn’t know better. It’s how you build the judgment that separates someone who can write a function from someone who can architect a system. You can’t become a senior overnight.</p><p>Unless you use AI, of course. Now, a junior with Claude Code (Opus 4.5+) delivers PRs that look like senior engineer work. And overall that’s a good thing, I think. But does it mean that the senior hat fits everyone now? From day one? But the head underneath hasn’t changed. That junior doesn’t know  that architecture was chosen. From my experience, sometimes CC misses a new DB transaction where it’s needed. Sometimes it creates a lock on a resource, that shouldn’t be locked, due to number of reasons. I can defend my decisions and I enjoy when my code is challenged, when reviewers disagree, and we have a discussion. What will a junior do? Ask Claude.</p><p>It’s a two-sided collapse. Seniors who stop writing code and only review AI output lose their own depth. Juniors who skip the struggle never build it. Organizations are spending senior time every day on reviews while simultaneously breaking the mechanisms that create it. The pipeline that produced senior engineers, writing bad code, getting bad code reviewed, building intuition through failure, is being bypassed entirely. Nobody’s talking about what happens when that pipeline runs dry.</p><h2>What C-Levels Got Right and Wrong</h2><p>The problem is that predictions come from people selling AI or trying to prop the stock with AI hype. They have every incentive to accelerate adoption and zero accountability when the timelines slip, which, historically, they always do. And “50% of code characters” at Google, a company that has built its own models, tooling, and infrastructure from scratch, says very little about what your team can achieve with off-the-shelf agents next Monday.</p><p>AI adoption is not a switch to flip, rather a skill to calibrate. It’s not as simple as mandating specific tools, setting “AI-first” policies, measuring developers on how much AI they use (/r/ExperiencedDevs is full of these stories). A lot of good practices like usage of design patterns, proper test coverage, manual testing before merging, are often skipped these days because it reduces the pace. AI broke it? AI will fix it. You need a review? AI will do it. Not even Greptile or CodeRabbit. Just delegate the PR to Claude Code reviewer agent. Or Gemini. Or Codex. Pick your poison.</p><p>And here’s what actually happens when you force the AI usage. One developer on r/ExperiencedDevs <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1o643iz/i_am_blissfully_using_ai_to_do_absolutely_nothing/\">described</a> their company tracking AI usage per engineer: “I just started asking my bots to do random things I don’t even care about. The other day I told Claude to examine random directories to ‘find bugs’ or answer questions I already knew the answer to.” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1r4u0mo/comment/o5e5r2w/\">This thread</a> is full of engineers reporting that AI has made code reviews “infinitely harder due to the AI slop produced by tech leads who have been off the tools long enough to be dangerous.”</p><p>This is sad, because being able to work with the AI tools is a perk for developers and since it improves pace, it’s something management wants as well. It’s obvious that the people gaming the metrics (not really using the AI the way the should) would be fired on the spot if the management learned how they are gaming the metrics (and it’s fair), but they are gaming the metrics because they don’t want to be fired…</p><p>Who should be responsible for setting the threshold of AI usage at the company? What if your top performing engineer just refuses to use AI? What if the newly hired junior uses AI all the time? These are the new questions and management is trying to find an answer to them, but it’s not as simple as measuring the AI usage.</p><p>This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart’s law</a> in action: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Track AI usage per engineer and you won’t get better engineering, you’ll get compliance theater. Developers game the metrics, resent the tools, and the actual productivity gains that AI  deliver get buried under organizational dysfunction.</p><h2>The Cost Nobody Talks About</h2><p>The financial cost is obvious. Agent time for non-trivial features is measured in hours, and those hours aren’t free. But the human cost is potentially worse, and it’s barely discussed.</p><p>Writing code can put you in a flow state, mentioned before. That deep, focused, creative problem-solving where hours disappear and you emerge with something you built and understand. And you’re proud of it. Someone wrote under your PR “Good job!” and gave you an approval. Reviewing AI-generated code does not do this. It’s the opposite. It’s a mental drain.</p><p>Developers need the dopamine hit of creation. That’s not a perk, it’s what keeps good engineers engaged, learning, retained, and prevents burnout. The joy of coding is probably what allowed them to become experienced devs in the first place. Replace creation with oversight and you get faster burnout, not faster shipping. You’ve turned engineering, the creative work, into the worst form of QA. The AI does all the art, the human folds the laundry.</p><p>I use AI every day. I use AI heavily at work, I use AI in my sideprojects, and I don’t want to go back. I love it! That’s why I’m worried. I’m afraid I became addicted and dependent. I’ve implemented countless custom commands, skills, and agents. I check CC release notes daily. And I know many are in similar situation right now, and we all wonder about what the future brings. Are we going to replace ourselves with AI? Or will we be responsible for cleaning AI slop? What’s the right amount of AI usage for me?</p><p>AI is just a tool. An extraordinarily powerful one, but a tool nonetheless. You wouldn’t mandate that every engineer uses a specific IDE, or measure people on how many lines they write per day (…right?). You’d let them pick the tools that make  most effective and measure what actually matters, the work that ships.</p><p>The right amount of AI is not zero. And it’s not maximum.</p><p>The Shen-Tamkin study identified six distinct AI interaction patterns among developers. Three led to poor learning: full delegation, progressive reliance, and outsourcing debugging to AI. Three preserved learning even with full AI access: asking for explanations, posing conceptual questions, and writing code independently while using AI for clarification. The differentiator wasn’t whether developers used AI, it was whether they stayed cognitively engaged.</p><p>Software engineering was never just about typing code. It’s defining the problem well, understanding the problem, translating the language from business to product to code, clarifying ambiguity, making tradeoffs, understanding what breaks when you change something. Someone has to do that before AGI, and AGI is nowhere close (luckily). You’re on call, the phone rings at 3am, can you triage the issue without an agent? If not, you’ve probably taken AI coding too far. If the AI usage becomes a new performance metric of developer, maybe using AI too often, too much, should be discouraged as well? Not because these tools are bad, but because the coding skills are worth maintaining.</p><h3>The Risk of Too Little (anecdata)</h3><p>If you’re using no AI at all in 2026, you are leaving real gains on the table:</p><ul><li> AI is genuinely better than Google for navigating unfamiliar codebases, understanding legacy code, and finding relevant patterns. This alone justifies having it in your workflow (since 2023, Cursor etc)</li><li><strong>Boilerplate and scaffolding.</strong> Writing the hundredth CRUD endpoint, config file, or test scaffold by hand when an agent can produce it in seconds isn’t craftsmanship, it’s stubbornness. Just use AI. You’re not a CRUD developer anymore anyway, because we all wear many hats these days (post 2025 Sonnet)</li><li> The investigate, plan, implement, test, validate cycle that works with customized agents is a real improvement in how features get delivered. Hours instead of days for non-trivial work. It’s not the 10x that was promised, but 2x or 4x on an established codebases is low-hanging fruit. You must understand the output though and all the decisions AI made! (post 2025 Opus 4.5)</li><li> “What does this module do? How does this API work? What would break if I changed this?” AI is excellent at these questions. It won’t replace reading the code, but it’ll get you to the right file in the right minute. (since 2023)</li></ul><p>Refusing to use AI out of principle is as irrational as adopting it out of hype.</p><h3>The Risk of Too Much (anecdata and my predictions)</h3><p>If you go all-in on autonomous AI coding (especially without learning how it all actually works), you risk something worse than slow velocity, you risk  degradation:</p><ul><li><strong>Bugs that look like features.</strong> AI-generated code passes CI. The types check. The tests are green. And somewhere inside there’s a subtle logic error, a hallucinated edge case, a pattern that’ll collapse under load. In domains like finance or healthcare, a wrong number that doesn’t throw an error is worse than a crash. (less and less relevant, but still relevant)</li><li><strong>A codebase nobody understands.</strong> When the agent writes everything and humans only review, six months later nobody on the team can explain why the system is architected the way it is. The AI made choices. Nobody questioned them because the tests passed. Storey <a href=\"https://margaretstorey.com/blog/2026/02/09/cognitive-debt/\">describes</a> a student team that hit exactly this wall: they couldn’t make simple changes without breaking things, and the problem wasn’t messy code, it was that no one could explain why certain design decisions had been made. Her conclusion: “velocity without understanding is not sustainable.” (will always be a problem, IMO)</li><li> Everything in the Digital Dementia section above. Skills you stop practicing will decline. (will always be a problem, IMO)</li><li><strong>The seniority pipeline drying up.</strong> Also covered above. This one takes years to manifest, which is exactly why nobody’s planning for it. (It’s a new problem, I have no idea what it looks like in the future)</li><li> Reviewing AI output all day without the dopamine of creation is not a sustainable job description. (Old problem, but potentially hits faster?)</li></ul><p>Here’s what keeps me up at night. By every metric on every dashboard, AI-assisted human development and human-assisted AI development is improving. More PRs shipped. More features delivered. Faster cycle times. The charts go up and to the right.</p><p>But metrics don’t capture what’s happening underneath. The mental fatigue of reviewing code you didn’t write all day. The boredom of babysitting an agent instead of solving problems. The slow, invisible erosion of the hard skills that made you good at this job in the first place. You stop holding the architecture in your head because the agent handles it. You stop thinking through edge cases because the tests pass. You stop  to dig deep because it’s easier to prompt and approve. There’s no spark in you anymore.</p><p>In this meme the developers are the butter robot. The ones with no mental capacity to review the plans and PRs from AI, will only click Accept, instead of doing the creative, challenging work. Oh the irony.</p><p>Simon Willison, one of the most ambitious developer of our time, <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/tags/cognitive-debt/\">admitted this is already happening to him</a>. On projects where he prompted entire features without reviewing implementations, he “no longer has a firm mental model of what they can do and how they work.”</p><p>And then, one day, the metrics start slipping… Not because the tool got worse, but because you did. Not from lack of effort, but from lack of practice. It’s a feedback loop that looks like progress right up until it doesn’t.</p><p>No executive wants to measure this. “What is the effect of AI usage on our engineers’ cognitive abilities over 18 months?” is not an easy KPI. It doesn’t fit in a quarterly review. It doesn’t get tracked, and what doesn’t get tracked doesn’t get managed, until it shows up as a production incident that nobody on the team can debug without an agent, and the agent can’t debug either.</p><p>I’m not anti-AI, I like it a lot. I’m addicted to prompting, I get high from it. I’m just worried that this new dependency degrades us over time, quietly, and nobody’s watching for it.</p>","contentLength":19251,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47194847"},{"title":"A Crash Course on High Availability","url":"https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/what-is-high-availability","date":1772283429,"author":"Neo Kim","guid":40,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Why should we care about uptime?

Whether you’re worried about prompt injection, a model trying to escape its sandbox, or something nobody’s thought of yet, regardless of what your threat model is, you shouldn’t be trusting the agent. The right approach isn’t better permission checks or smarter allowlists. It’s architecture that assumes agents will misbehave and contains the damage when they do.</p><p>OpenClaw runs directly on the host machine by default. It has an opt-in Docker sandbox mode, but it’s turned off out of the box, and most users never turn it on. Without it, security relies entirely on application-level checks: allowlists, confirmation prompts, a set of “safe” commands. These checks come from a place of implicit trust that the agent isn’t going to try to do something wrong. Once you adopt the mindset that an agent is potentially malicious, it’s obvious that application-level blocks aren’t enough. They don’t provide hermetic security. A determined or compromised agent can find ways around them.</p><p>In NanoClaw, container isolation is a core part of the architecture. Each agent runs in its own container, on Docker or an Apple Container on macOS. Containers are ephemeral, created fresh per invocation and destroyed afterward. The agent runs as an unprivileged user and can only see directories that have been explicitly mounted in. A container boundary is enforced by the OS.</p><p>Even when OpenClaw’s sandbox is enabled, all agents share the same container. You might have one agent as a personal assistant and another for work, in different WhatsApp groups or Telegram channels. They’re all in the same environment, which means information can leak between agents that are supposed to be accessing different data.</p><p>Agents shouldn’t trust each other any more than you trust them. In NanoClaw, each agent gets its own container, filesystem, and Claude session history. Your personal assistant can’t see your work agent’s data because they run in completely separate sandboxes.</p><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 960 460\" font-family=\"'JetBrains Mono', 'SF Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Shared container vs per-agent containers: in a shared container all agents see everything, with per-agent containers each agent is isolated\"></svg><p>The container boundary is the hard security layer — the agent can’t escape it regardless of configuration. On top of that, a mount allowlist at <code>~/.config/nanoclaw/mount-allowlist.json</code> acts as an additional layer of defense-in-depth: it exists to prevent the  from accidentally mounting something that shouldn’t be exposed, not to prevent the agent from breaking out. Sensitive paths (, , , , , ) are blocked by default. The allowlist lives outside the project directory, so a compromised agent can’t modify its own permissions. The host application code is mounted read-only, so nothing an agent does can persist after the container is destroyed.</p><p>People in your groups shouldn’t be trusted either. Non-main groups are untrusted by default. Other groups, and the people in them, can’t message other chats, schedule tasks for other groups, or view other groups’ data. Anyone in a group could send a prompt injection, and the security model accounts for that.</p><h2>Don’t trust what you can’t read</h2><p>OpenClaw has nearly half a million lines of code, 53 config files, and over 70 dependencies. This breaks the basic premise of open source security. Chromium has 35+ million lines, but you trust Google’s review processes. Most open source projects work the other way: they stay small enough that many eyes can actually review them. Nobody has reviewed OpenClaw’s 400,000 lines. It was written in weeks with no proper review process. Complexity is where vulnerabilities hide, and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/02/19/running-openclaw-safely-identity-isolation-runtime-risk/\">Microsoft’s analysis</a> confirmed this: OpenClaw’s risks could emerge through normal API calls, because no one person could see the full picture.</p><p>NanoClaw is one process and a handful of files. We rely heavily on Anthropic’s Agent SDK, the wrapper around Claude Code, for session management, memory compaction, and a lot more, instead of reinventing the wheel. A competent developer can review the entire codebase in an afternoon. This is <a href=\"https://nanoclaw.dev/#philosophy\">a deliberate constraint, not a limitation</a>. Our <a href=\"https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribution guidelines</a> accept bug fixes, security fixes, and simplifications only.</p><p>New functionality comes through skills: instructions with a full working reference implementation that a coding agent merges into your codebase. You review exactly what code will be added before it lands. And you only add the integrations you actually need. Every installation ends up as a few thousand lines of code tailored to the owner’s exact requirements.</p><p>This is the real difference. With a monolithic codebase of 400,000 lines, even if you only enable two integrations, the rest of the code is still there. It’s still loaded, still part of your attack surface, still reachable by prompt injections and rogue agents. You can’t disentangle what’s active from what’s dormant. You can’t audit it because you can’t even define the boundary of what “your code” is. With skills, the boundary is obvious: it’s a few thousand lines, it’s all code you chose to add, and you can read every line of it. The core is actually getting smaller over time: WhatsApp support, for example, is being pulled out and packaged as a skill.</p><p>If a hallucination or a misbehaving agent can cause a security issue, then the security model is broken. Security has to be enforced outside the agentic surface, not depend on the agent behaving correctly. Containers, mount restrictions, and filesystem isolation all exist so that even when an agent does something unexpected, the blast radius is contained.</p><p>None of this eliminates risk. An AI agent with access to your data is inherently a high-risk arrangement. But the right response is to make that trust as narrow and as verifiable as possible. Don’t trust the agent.

Session time before slowdown goes from ~30 minutes to ~3 hours. Context remaining after 45 minutes: 99% instead of 60%.</p><p>Two ways. Plugin Marketplace gives you auto-routing hooks and slash commands:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"><code data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Or MCP-only if you just want the tools:</p><figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=\"\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"><code data-language=\"bash\" data-theme=\"github-light\"></code></pre></figure><p>Restart Claude Code. Done.</p><p>You don't change how you work. Context Mode includes a PreToolUse hook that automatically routes tool outputs through the sandbox. Subagents learn to use  as their primary tool. Bash subagents get upgraded to  so they can access MCP tools.</p><p>The practical difference: your context window stops filling up. Sessions that used to hit the wall at 30 minutes now run for 3 hours. The same 200K tokens, used more carefully.</p><p>I run the MCP Directory &amp; Hub. 100K+ daily requests. See every MCP server that ships. The pattern was clear: everyone builds tools that dump raw data into context. Nobody was solving the output side.</p><p>Cloudflare's Code Mode blog post crystallized it. They compressed tool definitions. We compress tool outputs. Same principle, other direction.</p><p>Built it for my own Claude Code sessions first. Noticed I could work 6x longer before context degradation. Open-sourced it.</p>","contentLength":3826,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47193064"}],"tags":["dev"]}
