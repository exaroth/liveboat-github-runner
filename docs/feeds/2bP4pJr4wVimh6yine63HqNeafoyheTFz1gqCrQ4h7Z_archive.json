HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIs</h3><p>HTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.</p><p>In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:</p><p>It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.</p><h3>2. REST is Resource-Oriented</h3><p>In RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a <strong>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>→ A collection (or list) of books</p></li><li><p> → A specific book with ID 123</p></li></ul><p>An  is a combination of:</p><ul><li><p>An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)</p></li><li><p>A resource URI (, )</p></li></ul><p>Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource.</p><ul><li><p> → Fetch all books</p></li><li><p> → Create a new book</p></li><li><p> → Delete the book with ID 123</p></li></ul><p>Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.</p><h3>4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API Responses</h3><p>Each API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.</p><p>Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.</p><p>Common status codes include:</p><ul><li><p>: The request was successfully received and processed.</p><ul><li><p>: The request succeeded.</p></li><li><p>: A new resource was successfully created.</p></li><li><p>: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).</p></li><li><p>: There was an error in the request sent by the client.</p><ul><li><p>: The request was malformed or invalid.</p></li><li><p>: Authentication is required or has failed.</p></li><li><p>: The client does not have permission to access the resource.</p></li><li><p>: The requested resource does not exist.</p></li><li><p>: Rate limit exceeded.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>: The server encountered an error while processing the request.</p><ul><li><p><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: A general error occurred on the server.</p></li><li><p>: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>1. Define Clear Resource Naming Conventions</strong></h2><p>Using a <strong>consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure</strong> for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.</p><p>Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.</p><pre><code><code>GET /getAllUsers\nPOST /createNewOrder\nDELETE /removeProduct/123</code></code></pre><pre><code>GET /users\nPOST /orders\nDELETE /products/123</code></pre>","contentLength":3656,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64780231-6a91-4d72-8ea2-159d4cd71f4e_1504x1056.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"What's an API?","url":"https://blog.algomaster.io/p/whats-an-api","date":1737437464,"author":"Ashish Pratap Singh","guid":679,"unread":true,"content":"<p>API stands for <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>.</p><p>At its core, an API is a  that takes an  and gives you predictable </p><p>Think of an API as a  that enables applications to interact <strong>without needing direct access to each other's code or database</strong>.</p><p>Almost every digital service you use today—social media, e-commerce, online banking, ride-hailing apps—all of them are a bunch of APIs working together.</p><ul><li><p> – If you provide a city name as input (), the API returns the <strong>current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions</strong>.</p></li><li><p> – If you provide a <strong>pickup and destination address</strong>, the API finds the  and calculates the estimated fare.</p></li><li><p> – If you provide a list of numbers (), the API returns the  ().</p></li></ul><p>When engineers build APIs, they clearly define <strong>what inputs the API accepts</strong> and , ensuring consistent behavior across different applications.</p><p>APIs follow a simple  model:</p><ul><li><p>A client (such as a web app or mobile app) makes a request to an API.</p></li><li><p>The API (hosted on an API server) processes the request, interacts with the necessary databases or services, and prepares a response.</p></li><li><p>The API sends the response back to the client in a structured format (usually JSON or XML).</p></li></ul><p>Every API requires , and passing incorrect data can result in errors.</p><p>For example: If you tried putting your name into the Google Maps API as an input, that wouldn’t work very well.</p><p>Some APIs also <strong>require inputs in a specific format</strong>.</p><p>Example: The  might need the input as  instead of .</p><p>APIs often  to ensure they are correct before processing them, which helps maintain .</p><p>Just as APIs require , they also return .</p><p>For example, the  always returns <strong>coordinates in the same format</strong>.</p><pre><code>{\n  \"latitude\": 40.6892,\n  \"longitude\": -74.0445\n}</code></pre><p>If the API can’t find the location, it provides an error response explaining why.</p><pre><code>{\n  \"error\": \"Invalid address format\",\n  \"code\": 400\n}</code></pre><p>The apps you use every day—whether it's <strong>Gmail, Instagram, Uber, or Spotify</strong>—are essentially <strong>a collection of APIs with a polished user interface (UI) on top</strong>.</p><p>Most applications follow the <strong>frontend/backend architecture</strong>, where:</p><ul><li><p>The  consists of APIs that handle <strong>data processing, business logic, and communication with databases</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The  is a <strong>graphical user interface (GUI)</strong> that interacts with these APIs, making applications user-friendly and accessible <strong>without requiring users to write code</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s break this down with a real-world example: .</p><p>Before the Uber app existed as a sleek, user-friendly experience, the company first built <strong>the core APIs that power ride-hailing services:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Calculating Fares &amp; Routes</p></li><li><p>Matching Riders &amp; Drivers</p></li></ul><p>These APIs run on Uber’s servers, forming the . Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request.</p><p> are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.</p><p>The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a <strong>frontend (user interface)</strong> on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .</p><p>When you enter your pickup &amp; destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.</p><p>Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.</p><p>APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .</p><h3>1. Open APIs (Public APIs)</h3><p>Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.</p><p>Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.</p><h4><strong>Example: YouTube Data API</strong></h4><p>Normally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .</p><p>For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with <code>\"machine learning tutorial\"</code> as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including <strong>titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links</strong>.</p><p>This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.</p><h3>2. Internal APIs (Private APIs)</h3><p>, also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.</p><p>Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.</p><p>Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.</p><p>Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into <strong>smaller, manageable services</strong>, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.</p><p>The first two types of APIs we discussed—<strong>Open APIs and Internal APIs</strong>—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.</p><p>But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).</p><p>These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.</p><p>Python’s built-in list API</p><p>When working with lists, Python provides a set of <strong>built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data</strong>.</p><pre><code>numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4]\nnumbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list\n\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\nfruits.append(\"orange\")  # API call to add an element\n\nfruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last element</code></pre><p>Instead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.</p><p>Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.</p><p>For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:</p><pre><code>import tensorflow as tf\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=\"relu\")])</code></pre><p>Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.</p><p>APIs communicate using different <strong>protocols and architectures</strong> that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.</p><h3>1. REST (Representational State Transfer)</h3><p>REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is <strong>lightweight, stateless, and scalable</strong>, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. </p><p>REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.</p><p>REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.</p><h4>Example: REST API for a Bookstore</h4><p><strong>Retrieve a list of books (GET Request):</strong></p><pre><code>GET https://api.bookstore.com/books</code></pre><pre><code>[\n  { \"id\": 1, \"title\": \"Clean Code\", \"author\": \"Robert C. Martin\" },\n  { \"id\": 2, \"title\": \"The Pragmatic Programmer\", \"author\": \"Andrew Hunt\" }\n]</code></pre><h3>2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</h3><p>SOAP is an older API communication method that <strong>relies on XML-based messaging</strong>. </p><p>Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.</p><p>SOAP messages are sent using  and require a <strong>WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file</strong>, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.</p><h4><strong>Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service</strong></h4><p> Fetching account balance</p><pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\" xmlns:bank=\"http://bank.example.com/\"&gt;\n   &lt;soapenv:Header/&gt;\n   &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;\n      &lt;bank:GetAccountBalance&gt;\n         &lt;bank:accountNumber&gt;123456&lt;/bank:accountNumber&gt;\n      &lt;/bank:GetAccountBalance&gt;\n   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;\n&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;\n</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/\"&gt;\n   &lt;soapenv:Body&gt;\n      &lt;bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse&gt;\n         &lt;bank:balance&gt;5000.00&lt;/bank:balance&gt;\n      &lt;/bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse&gt;\n   &lt;/soapenv:Body&gt;\n&lt;/soapenv:Envelope&gt;</code></pre><p>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that <strong>allows clients to request exactly the data they need</strong>, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can <strong>fetch all necessary data in a single request</strong>.</p><p>Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.</p><h4>Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.</h4><pre><code>{\n  user(id: 123) {\n    name\n    email\n    posts {\n      title\n      likes\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><pre><code>{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"name\": \"Alice\",\n      \"email\": \"alice@example.com\",\n      \"posts\": [\n        { \"title\": \"Hello World\", \"likes\": 100 },\n        { \"title\": \"GraphQL is Amazing!\", \"likes\": 200 }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre><p>gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a <strong>high-performance API communication method</strong> that uses <strong>Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)</strong> instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.</p><p>gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.</p><p>Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.</p><p>Here’s a guide on<strong> how to find, access, and interact with an API</strong> step by step:</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Find an API to Use</strong></h3><p>Before using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.</p><p><strong>Official API Documentation:</strong></p><h3><strong>Step 2: Read the API Documentation</strong></h3><p>API documentation explains <strong>how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats</strong>.</p><p>The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:</p><pre><code>https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&amp;appid=YOUR_API_KEY</code></pre><ul><li><p>: City name (e.g., )</p></li><li><p>: API Key (required for access)</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)</strong></h3><p>Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.</p><h4><strong>Common Authentication Methods:</strong></h4><ul><li><p>A unique key provided by the API service</p></li><li><p>Secure login via Google, Github, etc.</p></li><li><p>Token-based authentication</p></li><li><p>Username + password (Base64 encoded)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.</p></li><li><p>Go to the  section and generate a key.</p></li><li><p>Use the API key in requests:</p></li></ul><pre><code>GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&amp;appid=YOUR_API_KEY</code></pre><h3><strong>Step 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURL</strong></h3><p>Before writing code,  to see how it responds.</p><h4><strong>Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Click , enter the API endpoint URL (<code>https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&amp;appid=YOUR_API_KEY</code>).</p></li><li><p>Select  as the HTTP method.</p></li><li><p>Click  and view the response in .</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)</strong></h4><p>You can also test APIs directly from the  using .</p><pre><code>curl -X GET \"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&amp;appid=YOUR_API_KEY\"</code></pre><h3><strong>Step 5: Write Code to Call the API</strong></h3><p>Now that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to <strong>integrate it into your application</strong>.</p><h4><strong>Example: Calling an API in Python</strong></h4><pre><code>import requests\n\nurl = \"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&amp;appid=YOUR_API_KEY\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    print(f\"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Error:\", response.status_code)</code></pre><ul><li><p> – Sends an API request.</p></li><li><p> – Converts response to JSON.</p></li><li><p><code>if response.status_code == 200</code> – Checks if the request was successful.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Step 6: Handle Errors &amp; Rate Limits</strong></h3><p>APIs <strong>don’t always return perfect responses</strong>. You should handle:</p><ul><li><p> (e.g., wrong city name).</p></li><li><p> (e.g., expired API keys).</p></li><li><p> (e.g., exceeding request limits).</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Handling API Errors in Python</strong></h4><pre><code>if response.status_code == 200:\n    data = response.json()\n    print(f\"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}\")\nelif response.status_code == 401:\n    print(\"Error: Invalid API key\")\nelif response.status_code == 404:\n    print(\"Error: City not found\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}\")</code></pre><h3>Step 7: Use API Responses in Your Application</h3><p>Once you fetch data from an API, you can <strong>display it dynamically in a web or mobile app</strong>.</p><p> You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.</p><ul><li><p>Fetch live weather data from the API.</p></li><li><p>Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).</p></li><li><p>Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.</p></li></ul><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/scalability?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQwMDc4MDk0LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzc1MzgxODMsImV4cCI6MTc0MDEzMDE4MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.xroFXQDDEPvo2FWnnt-G2Ji9MzYIDtJ68NRQX6sT8x8&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div></div><p>If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p>","contentLength":12971,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae14a376-92a3-4ff6-a329-8e4f2a7ac9b5_1546x1074.png","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"System Design Interviews were HARD Until I Learned these 15 Tips","url":"https://blog.algomaster.io/p/system-design-interview-tips","date":1737001843,"author":"Ashish Pratap Singh","guid":678,"unread":true,"content":"<p>When I started preparing for  for the first time in 2019, I felt completely overwhelmed.

You Need to Lay the Right Foundation</strong></h3><p>Coding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.</p><p>Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.</p><p>The solution? Master these core areas:</p><ul></ul><p>💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.</p><p>I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.</p><p>But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.</p><h3><strong>2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing Patterns</strong></h3><p>Ever feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?</p><p>It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.</p><p>Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.</p><p>When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.</p><p>Here are a few patterns worth mastering:</p><ul><li><p> Ideal for sorted arrays.</p></li><li><p> For substring or interval problems.</p></li><li><p> For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.</p></li><li><p>To answer range sum queries in constant time.</p></li><li><p>For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.</p></li><li><p>For exploring all possible configurations.</p></li></ul><p>💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.</p><p>Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.</p><h3><strong>3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real Deal</strong></h3><p>Here’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.</p><p>You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”</p><p>Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.</p><p>Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.</p><ul><li><p>Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.</p></li><li><p>Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.</p></li><li><p>Practice explaining your thought process out loud.</p></li></ul><p>💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.</p><p>It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.</p><h3><strong>4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact Topics</strong></h3><p>Not all topics are prioritized equally.</p><p>Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics.</p><ul><li><p> Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.</p></li><li><p>: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.</p></li><li><p>: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals.</p></li><li><p> DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.</p></li><li><p>: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.</p></li><li><p>: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.</p></li><li><p>: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching.</p></li><li><p> Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.</p></li></ul><p>💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.</p><p>Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.</p><p>The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.</p><h3><strong>5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an Engineer</strong></h3><p>Coding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.</p><p>Clear communication sets you apart.</p><ol><li><p> Restate it to show you understand.</p></li><li><p> Share your strategy before you start coding.</p></li><li><p> Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.</p></li></ol><p>💡  Record yourself solving a problem.</p><p>Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.</p><p>Interviewers don’t expect perfection—they expect clarity and problem-solving skills.</p><h3><strong>6. And Finally, You Need to Build Resilience</strong></h3><p>Let’s talk about failure.</p><p>It’s not if—it’s when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.</p><p>During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.</p><p>Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.</p><p>But every “wrong answer” was a chance to learn something new.</p><p>💡  Keep a failure journal.</p><p>Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you’ll tackle similar issues in the future.</p><p>Failure isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of better solutions.</p><p>Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:</p><ul><li><ul><li><p>Section for training as a team.</p></li><li><p>Educational section to learn new topics.</p></li><li><p>Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.</p></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><p>Slightly advanced topics.</p></li><li><p>The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>If you’ve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.</p><p>And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life—more on that in this post:</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;id&quot;:153618089,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://albexl.substack.com/p/competitive-programming-changed-my&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:1412859,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Algorithmically Speaking&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F122a9387-dca2-4a14-9358-97b897b474ce_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Competitive Programming Changed My Life Forever&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;I’m writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden—a place where I’ve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life.&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2024-12-26T12:07:24.294Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:31,&quot;comment_count&quot;:7,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:121975303,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alberto Gonzalez&quot;,&quot;handle&quot;:&quot;albexl&quot;,&quot;previous_name&quot;:&quot;Alberto Gonzalez 🚢&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0463f9f0-08db-4877-aa9c-e18dbb8888b3_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;MSc.

Is it really necessary to land a Software Engineering job?</p><p>The short answer is: .</p><p>There are plenty of startups and smaller companies that focus more on your experience with specific tech stacks and the projects you’ve built. They might not even include LeetCode style questions in their interview process.</p><p>But if your goal is to work at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, you would need to practice LeetCode style questions since that’s what they ask in their interviews.</p><h2>Which programming language to choose?</h2><p>This is a question I get asked all the time.</p><p>Many people get stuck at deciding which programming language to use.</p><p>But here’s the truth: <strong>It doesn’t really matter.</strong> A programming language is just a tool. Once you understand the approach to solving a problem, you can implement it in any language.</p><p>In my experience giving interviews, unless the job specifically requires expertise in a certain language, you’ll be fine using any language you’re comfortable with.</p><p>The point is, LeetCode isn’t about syntax. It’s about using the right data structures, algorithms, and your ability to think critically and solve problems.</p><p>That said, if you’re new to coding, I recommend starting with  It’s beginner-friendly and has a simpler syntax.</p><p>If you already know a language—stick with it. </p><p>Whether it’s C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go, there’s no need to switch.</p><p>You don’t need to be an expert in your chosen language, but you should know the basics like:</p><ul><li><p>and input/output operations</p></li></ul><p>Beyond the basics, spend some time learning the  for common data structures and algorithms.</p><p>These libraries save time and let you focus on solving the problem rather than reimplementing data structures from scratch.</p><ul><li><p>Python has lists, dictionaries, and sets.</p></li><li><p>Java has ArrayList, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.</p></li><li><p>C++ offers the STL library with vector, map, and set.</p></li></ul><p>Before diving into LeetCode problems, it’s good to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Basic Data Structures like</strong> Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.</p></li><li><p><strong>and Fundamental Algorithms like</strong> Sorting techniques, binary search, and recursion.</p></li></ul><p>Recursion is particularly important, since many problems specially tree and graph related ones rely heavily on it.</p><p>When you’re familiar with these topics, it becomes much easier to recognize which concept applies to a specific problem.</p><p>You don’t need to dive too deeply into every topic upfront. Most of your understanding will develop naturally as you solve problems.</p><p>There are plenty of resources available online to help you get started. Don’t waste time searching for the “perfect” resource—pick one and start learning.</p><p><strong>The focus should always be on progress, not perfection.</strong></p><p>Here are some resources I personally found quite useful:</p><p> It’s my second channel where I upload animated tutorials on DSA and LeetCode patterns.</p><p>Here’s a comprehensive list of DSA topics you should know for coding interviews:</p><h2>Learn one topic at a time</h2><p>If you’re a beginner, focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>For example: Start with , the move to , then progress to more complex topics like , , and .</p><p>This approach helps you develop a deeper understanding of each topic and teaches you how to recognize when to use a particular data structure or algorithm.</p><p>Once you’ve learned the basics of a topic and understand how to implement it from scratch, it’s time to put your knowledge to the test.</p><p>Solve 4-5 easy problems related to that topic on LeetCode.</p><ul><li><p>and Build confidence in applying the concepts.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to learn more about how to master a DSA topic, you can check out this article where I discuss it in more detail:</p><h2>Which problems should you solve?</h2><p>If you open LeetCode, there are over </p><p>That number alone can feel overwhelming. So, how do you decide which ones to solve?</p><p>Start with  for each topic. These are perfect for building confidence and understanding the basics of problem-solving.</p><p>Once you’re comfortable with the easy ones, gradually challenge yourself with slightly harder problems that push you beyond your comfort zone.</p><p>Remember, <strong>real growth happens when you</strong> constantly </p><p>Don’t worry about hard problems in the beginning.</p><p>Most coding interviews focus on , so that’s where you should spend the majority of your time.</p><p>These lists are excellent, and I highly recommend solving every problem on them.</p><h2>How many problems should you solve?</h2><p>There’s no magic number, but from my experience,  is the sweet spot.</p><p>However, it’s not about solving just any 300 problems. Focus on  that cover the most topics and patterns.</p><p>To make it easier for you, I’ve created a : a curated list of the <strong>Top 300 LeetCode Problems</strong> organized into that are most commonly asked in coding interviews.</p><p>You can find it on  Just head to the practice page. You will see a structured list  that you can follow from top to bottom.</p><ul><li><p>Resources to help you learn the topics.</p></li><li><p>Ability to track your progress and mark problems for future revision.</p></li><li><p>Links to <strong>GitHub and YouTube solutions</strong>.</p></li><li><p>and ability to filter problems based on pattern, difficulty level and status.</p></li></ul><p>Don’t rush through problems just to increase your count. Instead of focusing on the quantity of problems you solve, focus on what you learn from each problem.</p><p>It’s far better to deeply understand and solve 50 problems than to superficially solve 500 problems.</p><p>After solving a problem, ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p><em>Why does this solution work?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What’s the one key insight that made everything else easier?</em></p></li></ul><p>Also, try to make it fun. There is a fun in learning to solve coding challenges. It’s not just about getting a job.</p><h2>Focus on learning Patterns</h2><p>The key to getting better at LeetCode is learningas manypatterns as possible.</p><p>Instead of focusing on individual questions, focus on identifying  that connect similar problems.</p><p>On LeetCode, you’ll come across multiple problems that follow a similar patterns. Once you solve one of them, you can apply the same approach to solve others.</p><p>For example: After learning the monotonic stack , I was able to solve over 10 similar problems.</p><p>I made a  covering the 15 <strong>most important LeetCode patterns</strong> I learned after solving over 1,500 problems. You can check it out later.</p><p>On , I’ve categorized problems by pattern. This makes it easy to focus on one pattern at a time. By going through the list, you will get to know all the important patterns for coding interviews.</p><h2>How to approach a new problem?</h2><h4><strong>1. Read the Problem Statement Twice</strong></h4><p>The first time, focus on getting the big picture. What is the problem asking you to do?</p><p>On the second read, pay attention to specific constraints and conditions. These small details often provide clues for optimizing your solution.</p><h4><strong>2. Analyze the Input and Output Examples</strong></h4><p>Carefully go through the examples provided in the problem.</p><p>Walk through the input and output step by step to understand how the problem works. I have found that, many times simply walking through a few examples helped me figure out the solution.</p><h4><strong>3. Visualize with pen and paper</strong></h4><p>Many problems specially the ones related to trees and graphs are much easier to understand when you draw them out.</p><p>Try to take examples that cover different scenarios and input sizes. Think about any  that might come up.</p><h4><strong>4. Start with a Brute Force Approach</strong></h4><p>Don’t expect to come up with the most optimal solution right away.</p><p>First see, if you can solve the problems using a brute force approach. While it might not be efficient, it gives you a baseline to improve upon.</p><h4><strong>5. Optimize Your Solution</strong></h4><p>Once you have a brute force solution, focus on optimizing it.</p><p>Here are few things to consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Leverage Unused Information</strong>: Look for details you might have missed. For instance, if the problem states that the array is sorted, consider leveraging this to use binary search or a two-pointer approach.</p></li><li><p>: If certain calculations are repeated multiple times, consider precomputing them. Use techniques like  or  to avoid redundant calculations. Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Time vs. Space Tradeoffs:</strong> Sometimes, using additional memory (e.g., hash tables) can speed up your solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Structure Brainstorm:</strong> Run through the popular data structures and try to apply each one to the problem at hand.</p></li></ul><p>Avoid overcomplicating your solution. At every stage ask yourself, <em><strong>\"Is there a simpler way to do this?\"</strong></em>. This will not only make your solution easier to understand but it will also reduce the chances of errors during coding.</p><h4><strong>7. Analyze Time and Space Complexity</strong></h4><p>Develop the habit of analyzing the time and space complexity of every problem you submit.</p><h2>How much time should you spend on each problem?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, even  can take a while to solve. That’s completely normal—don’t get discouraged if you can’t come up with a solution right away.</p><p>Your main goal in the beginning should be to  and understanding the problem deeply. Real progress happens when you take the time to think, make mistakes and refine your approach.</p><p>But, some problems involve specific tricks or patterns that are hard to figure out unless you’ve seen them before.</p><p>Spending hours on such problems without progress can be counterproductive.</p><p>Here’s a good rule of thumb:</p><ul><li><p>Give yourself  of focused effort for each problem.</p></li><li><p>If you’re still stuck, it’s okay to look at hints or solutions.</p></li></ul><p>Read the official solution and and try to understand the top voted solutions on LeetCode discussion forum.</p><p>Don’t just move on after viewing the solution. Try to grasp why the solution works.</p><p>Rewrite the solution from scratch without looking at the code. Writing it yourself helps you internalize the approach and ensures you truly understand it.</p><p>If you couldn’t solve the problem on your first attempt, mark it for  and revisit it after a few weeks. Revisiting problems helps reinforce your understanding and ensures long-term retention.</p><p>One of the most common mistakes—one that I made myself—is  to difficult problems and moving on.</p><p>At first, it might seem like a shortcut, but in reality, it’s a  for three main reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>You’ll quickly forget memorized solutions.</strong> Without understanding the logic behind them, they won’t stick in your memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your problem-solving skills won’t improve.</strong> Memorization skips the critical thinking process, which is the real value of practicing coding problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>You’ll struggle in interviews.</strong> Most interviewers ask variants of problems or follow-up questions, and without a deep understanding, you won’t be able to adapt.</p></li></ol><p>Instead of memorizing, focus on understanding the solution, even if it takes hours.</p><p>Break it down step by step and ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Why does this approach work?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What’s the key insight that simplifies the problem?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How can I apply this approach to similar problems?</strong></p></li></ul><p>This effort pays off in the long term. The deeper your understanding, the more confident you’ll feel explaining your thought process during interviews.</p><h2>Practice in a timed environment</h2><p>Solving a problem during an interview is very different from solving it from the comfort of your home.</p><p>That’s why it’s a good idea to time-box yourself and practice in a timed environment after you have learned the basics and solved 100-150 problems.</p><p>Simply turn on a timer while practicing and try to complete the problem within that time.</p><ul><li><p>For , aim to complete them in </p></li><li><p>For , set a timer for </p></li><li><p>For , allow yourself </p></li></ul><p>To take your practice a step further:</p><ul><li><p>Try  by simulating past LeetCode contests.</p></li></ul><p>It’s okay if you struggle to solve even one problem initially—this is normal. The goal is to gain experience solving problems within a time limit.</p><p>When I started participating in contests, I could only solve 1-2 problems. But with consistent practice, I improved to solving 3 problems, and eventually, I was able to solve all of them in some contests.</p><p>Getting good at LeetCode isn’t just about learning new concepts or solving problems—it’s also about retaining that knowledge over time.</p><p>That’s why you should regularly revisit concepts and problems you’ve already solved, especially the ones you found challenging.</p><p>Try to solve those problems again <strong>without looking at the solution.</strong></p><p>By practicing consistently and revisiting old problems, you’ll make it much easier to retain what you’ve learned over time.</p><p>I discuss more about how to effectively revise LeetCode problems in this article, so make sure to check it out: </p><p>Getting good at LeetCode takes time.</p><p>Some topics might take weeks or even months to master, and that’s okay. </p><p>Be patient with yourself and remember: It’s completely normal to feel stuck or frustrated when working on a tough problem or grasping a complex topic.</p><p>If a problem feels too hard, take a break, then come back to it with a fresh perspective.</p><p>The more you practice, the better you will get at solving LeetCode problems.</p><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/scalability?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQwMDc4MDk0LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzc1MzgxODMsImV4cCI6MTc0MDEzMDE4MywiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.xroFXQDDEPvo2FWnnt-G2Ji9MzYIDtJ68NRQX6sT8x8&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"CaptionedButtonToDOM\"><div><p>This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div></div><p>If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p>","contentLength":14107,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a074c17-0163-4236-86a4-1cc16d63cc1f_800x616.jpeg","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"7 Cache Eviction Strategies You Should Know","url":"https://blog.algomaster.io/p/7-cache-eviction-strategies","date":1735824121,"author":"Ashish Pratap Singh","guid":674,"unread":true,"content":"<p> is a technique to make applications lightning fast, reduce database load, and improve user experience.</p><p>But, cache memory is  - you can’t store everything.</p><p>So, how do you decide which items to keep and which ones to evict when space runs out?</p><p>This is where <strong>cache eviction strategies</strong> come into play.

It assumes that items accessed less frequently in the past are less likely to be accessed in the future.</p><p>Unlike LRU, which focuses on , LFU emphasizes  of access.</p><ul><li><p>: LFU maintains a frequency count for each item in the cache, incrementing the count each time the item is accessed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache):</strong> When an item is accessed, its frequency count is increased.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):</strong></p><ul><li><p>If the cache has available space, the new item is added with an initial frequency count of 1.</p></li><li><p>If the cache is full, the <strong>item with the lowest frequency</strong> is evicted to make room for the new item. If multiple items share the same lowest frequency, a secondary strategy (like LRU or FIFO) resolves ties.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>: Remove the item with the smallest frequency count.</p></li></ul><p>Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:</p><ol><li><p>: Empty cache.</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1)]</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1)]</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]</p></li><li><p>Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=1), D (freq=1)] (B is evicted as it has the lowest frequency).</p></li><li><p>Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=2), D (freq=1)]</p></li></ol><ol><li><p><strong>Efficient for Predictable Patterns</strong>: Retains frequently accessed data, which is often more relevant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Highly Effective for Popular Data</strong>: Works well in scenarios with clear \"hot\" items.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>: Requires additional memory to track frequency counts.</p></li><li><p>: Tracking and updating frequency can slow down operations.</p></li><li><p>: May keep items that were frequently accessed in the past but are no longer relevant.</p></li></ol><h2>3. First In, First Out (FIFO)</h2><p>FIFO evicts the item that was added first, regardless of how often it’s accessed.</p><p>FIFO operates under the assumption that items added earliest are least likely to be needed as the cache fills up.</p><ul><li><p>: When an item is added to the cache, it is placed at the end of the queue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): </strong>No changes are made to the order of items. FIFO does not prioritize recently accessed items.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):</strong></p><ul><li><p>If there is space in the cache, the new item is added to the end of the queue.</p></li><li><p>If the cache is full, the item at the front of the queue (the oldest item) is evicted to make space for the new item.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>: The oldest item, which has been in the cache the longest, is removed to make room for the new item.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:</p><ol><li><p>Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is evicted because it was added first).</p></li><li><p>Access  → Cache: [B, C, D] (Order remains unchanged).</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [C, D, E] (B is evicted because it was the oldest remaining item).</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>: FIFO is straightforward and requires minimal logic.</p></li><li><p>: No need to track additional metadata like access frequency or recency.</p></li><li><p>: Eviction follows a predictable order.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>: Items still in frequent use can be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suboptimal for Many Use Cases</strong>: FIFO is rarely ideal in modern systems where recency and frequency matter.</p></li><li><p>: If old but frequently used items are evicted, the cache loses its utility.</p></li></ol><h2>4. Random Replacement (RR)</h2><p>RR cache eviction strategy is the simplest of all: when the cache is full, it evicts a random item to make space for a new one.</p><p>It doesn't track recency, frequency, or insertion order, making it a lightweight approach with minimal computational overhead.</p><p>This simplicity can sometimes be surprisingly effective, especially in systems with unpredictable or highly dynamic access patterns.</p><ul><li><p>: When an item is added to the cache and there is space, it is stored directly.</p></li><li><p> If the requested item exists in the cache, it is served, and no changes are made to the cache.</p></li><li><p> If the item is not in the cache and the cache is full, a random item is removed.</p></li><li><p>: The randomly selected item is removed, and the new item is added to the cache.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:</p><ol><li><p>Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is randomly evicted).</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [C, E, D] (B is randomly evicted).</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>: No need for metadata like access frequency or recency.</p></li><li><p>: Computational and memory requirements are minimal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fair for Unpredictable Access Patterns</strong>: Avoids bias toward recency or frequency, which can be useful in some scenarios.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p>: A frequently used item might be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inefficient for Stable Access Patterns</strong>: Doesn’t adapt well when certain items are consistently accessed.</p></li><li><p><strong>High Risk of Poor Cache Hit Rates</strong>: Random eviction often leads to suboptimal retention of important items.</p></li></ol><h2>5. Most Recently Used (MRU)</h2><p> is the opposite of <strong>Least Recently Used (LRU)</strong>. In MRU, the item that was accessed most recently is the first to be evicted when the cache is full.</p><p>The idea behind MRU is that the most recently accessed item is likely to be a temporary need and won’t be accessed again soon, so evicting it frees up space for potentially more valuable data.</p><ul><li><p>: When a new item is added to the cache, it is marked as the most recently used.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache):</strong> When an item is accessed, it is marked as the most recently used.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):</strong></p><ul><li><p>If the cache has available space, the new item is added directly.</p></li><li><p>If the cache is full, the most recently used item is evicted to make room for the new item.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>: The item that was accessed or added most recently is removed.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:</p><ol><li><p>Access  → Cache: [A, B, C] (C is marked as the most recently used).</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [A, B, D] (C is evicted as it was the most recently used).</p></li><li><p>Access  → Cache: [A, B, D] (B becomes the most recently used).</p></li><li><p>Add  → Cache: [A, D, E] (B is evicted as it was the most recently used).</p></li></ol><ol><li><p><strong>Effective in Specific Scenarios</strong>: Retains older data, which might be more valuable in certain workloads.</p></li><li><p>: Requires minimal metadata.</p></li></ol><ol><li><p><strong>Suboptimal for Most Use Cases</strong>: MRU assumes recent data is less valuable, which is often untrue for many applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Poor Hit Rate in Predictable Patterns</strong>: Fails in scenarios where recently accessed data is more likely to be reused.</p></li><li><p>: Limited applicability compared to other strategies like LRU or LFU.</p></li></ol><p> is a cache eviction strategy where each cached item is assigned a fixed lifespan. Once an item’s lifespan expires, it is automatically removed from the cache, regardless of access patterns or frequency.</p><p>This ensures that cached data remains fresh and prevents stale data from lingering in the cache indefinitely.</p><ul><li><p>: When an item is added to the cache, a TTL value (e.g., 10 seconds) is assigned to it.
