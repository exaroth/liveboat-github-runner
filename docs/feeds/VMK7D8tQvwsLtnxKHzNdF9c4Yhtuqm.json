But it’s ultra-useful if you can close the loop between the LLM and the execution environment (with an “Agent” setup). There’s lots to say about this, but for the moment: it’s a semi-effective antidote to hallucination: the LLM generates the code, the agent scaffolding runs the code, the code generates errors, the agent feeds it back to the LLM, the process iterates. </p><p>So, obviously, the issue here is you don’t want this iterative development process happening on your development laptop, because LLMs have boundary issues, and they’ll iterate on your system configuration just as happily on the Git project you happen to be working in. A thing you’d really like to be able to do: run a closed-loop agent-y (“agentic”? is that what we say now) configuration for an LLM, on a clean-slate Linux instance that spins up instantly and that can’t screw you over in any way. You get where we’re going with this.</p><p>Anyways! I would like to register a concern.</p><p>Emacs hosts the spiritual forebearer of remote editing systems, a blob of hyper-useful Elisp called <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/\" title=\"\">“Tramp”</a>. If you can hook Tramp up to any kind of interactive environment — usually, an SSH session — where it can run Bourne shell commands, it can extend Emacs to that environment.</p><p>So, VSCode has a feature like Tramp. Which, neat, right? You’d think, take Tramp, maybe simplify it a bit, switch out Elisp for Typescript.</p><p>Unlike Tramp, which lives off the land on the remote connection, VSCode mounts a full-scale invasion: it runs a Bash snippet stager that downloads an agent, including a binary installation of Node. </p><p>The agent runs over port-forwarded SSH. It establishes a WebSockets connection back to your running VSCode front-end. The underlying protocol on that connection can:</p><ul><li>Wander around the filesystem\n</li><li>Launch its own shell PTY processes\n</li></ul><p>In security-world, there’s a name for tools that work this way. I won’t say it out loud, because that’s not fair to VSCode, but let’s just say the name is murid in nature.</p><p>I would be a little nervous about letting people VSCode-remote-edit stuff on dev servers, and apoplectic if that happened during an incident on something in production. </p><p>It turns out we don’t have to care about any of this to get a custom connection to a Fly Machine working in VSCode, so none of this matters in any kind of deep way, but: we’ve decided to just be a blog again, so: we had to learn this, and now you do too.</p>","contentLength":2855,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979467"},{"title":"Asahi Linux lead developer Hector Martin resigns from Linux kernel","url":"https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/2/7/9","date":1738933323,"author":"Mond_","guid":220,"unread":true,"content":"I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process orcommunity management approach.<p>Apple/ARM platform development will continue downstream.

Critics have labeled the legislation the \"Snooper's Charter,\" as it authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence.</p><p>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the revelation, though the law actually makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government even made such a demand. Likewise, the Home Office told the publication that its policy was not to discuss any technical demands. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a spokesman said.</p><blockquote><p>One of the people briefed on the situation, a consultant advising the United States on encryption matters, said Apple would be barred from warning its users that its most advanced encryption no longer provided full security. The person deemed it shocking that the UK government was demanding Apple's help to spy on non-British users without their governments' knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.</p></blockquote><h2>Apple May Drop UK iCloud Services Over Secret Encryption Access Order</h2><p>Apple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the UK, rather than break the security promises it made to its users, people familiar with the matter told the publication. However, that would not affect the UK order for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States. Apple has previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-deeply-concerned-uk-surveillance-law/\">said</a> it would consider pulling services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.</p><p>The order would compromise Apple's Advanced Data Protection, which the company launched in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-advanced-data-protection/\">2022</a>. The feature gives users the option to end-to-end encrypt many additional iCloud data categories, including Photos, Notes, Voice Memos, Messages backups, device backups, and more, making their data inaccessible to anyone else – including Apple.</p><p>Google has enforced default encryption for Android phone backups since 2018. When asked by  whether any government had requested a backdoor, Google spokesman Ed Fernandez did not provide a direct answer but suggested none exist: \"Google cannot access Android end-to-end encrypted backup data, even with a legal order,\" he stated.</p><p>The IPA was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-deeply-concerned-uk-surveillance-law/\">updated</a> in 2023 to allow the Home Office to outlaw certain encrypted services using a technical capability notice. Apple at the time called the then proposed amendments \"an unprecedented overreach by the government,\" saying that if the update was enacted, \"the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.\"</p><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has consistently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/12/21/60-minutes-inside-apple-special/\">insisted</a> that providing back-door access past its encryption for authorities would open the door for \"bad guys\" to gain access to its users' data. Cyber security experts agree that it would only be a matter of time before bad actors discover such a point of entry. Apple's stance was enhanced in 2016 when it successfully fought a US order to unlock the iPhone of a shooter in San Bernardino, California.</p><p>US law enforcement's longstanding objections to encryption have recently taken a backseat to concerns over large-scale cyber intrusions attributed to Chinese state-backed hackers. The attackers infiltrated major telecommunications providers, granting them unfettered access to private phone calls. During a December press conference alongside FBI officials, a Department of Homeland Security representative cautioned Americans against assuming traditional phone networks offer privacy, instead advising them to use encrypted communication whenever feasible.</p><p>That same month, the FBI, National Security Agency, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint advisory detailing numerous countermeasures against the Chinese cyber campaign. Among their recommendations: \"Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible.\"</p><p>In a statement, privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch said: \"This misguided attempt at tackling crime and terrorism will not make the UK safer, but it will erode the fundamental rights and civil liberties of the entire population.\"</p><p><small>Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/political-news.218/\">Political News</a> forum.

To me personally, it feels unavoidable: I can’t look down at my phone or glance up at a TV without seeing  that makes me upset. And that’s really exhausting. But when outrage is everywhere, what can we do to keep it from getting to us?</p><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/\">subscribing</a>. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Here to talk to us about fighting so-called outrage fatigue is Tanya Lewis, a senior editor covering health and medicine at .</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Tanya, thanks for joining us today.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Thanks so much for having me.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> So you recently wrote about this phenomenon called “outrage fatigue.” Could you tell us what that is?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Sure, so outrage fatigue is kind of an informal concept, which basically refers to repeatedly experiencing perceived moral transgressions and feeling fatigued by them. So what that basically means is just, you know, you see something, you’re outraged by it, and over time you just become kind of numb to it.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Sounds relevant to [laughs], to many of our lives.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> What do researchers know about outrage in general?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> So outrage fatigue itself hasn’t been that well-studied, but outrage in general has been studied, and people have found that, actually, outrage can be useful. It actually can help you identify a problem and react to it. But it can also be harmful if you’re experiencing it all the time and become overwhelmed by it.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">There’s actually a recent study by William Brady, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He and his colleagues found that outrage actually helps misinformation spread more widely, especially online on social media. So the upshot of this is that when you have too much outrage, people can actually withdraw from public spaces or virtual places like social media.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Yeah, and what is it about outrage that helps misinformation spread?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> So I think part of it is the fact that it’s more engaging. It, you know, activates your emotions, and so people are more primed to respond to that. As we all know, if you’ve ever spent time on social media and social networks, we always see the most kind of inflammatory content because that’s what gets retweets or clicks and the algorithms are amplifying that.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Right, and more broadly, you know, what is it about the times we’re living in that makes outrage so hard to avoid?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> So we’re living in a particularly polarized time, which I think is not a surprise to anybody. If you have been online lately, on Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or any other social media, you’ve probably seen people yelling about something or other. And this just really has been accelerating, I guess, in the last few years because of our political polarization and other world events.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">As I was saying earlier some amount of outrage is actually normal and healthy, but studies have shown that the majority of outrage posts on social media are actually driven by a small minority of users who are very—you know, they feel very strongly about something, and that can actually turn other people off of participating in the conversation.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Yeah, so social media is a big part of this, you know, both amplifying it and giving a platform for people who are feeling this outrage. Other than just making us feel bad, what does outrage fatigue do to a person?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> So the real danger is that we become apathetic, and if we’re exposed to something all the time—whether it’s through social media or even traditional news sources like cable TV—if it’s constantly telling us to be outraged, eventually we’re gonna be less responsive and we’re gonna kind of pull back. So instead of, like, channeling that outrage into something useful, many people sort of feel exhausted and burned out, and they just don’t want to take action at all.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">And this is actually a problem because politicians can take advantage of that and sort of manipulate people. As we’ve seen over the last few decades some of the big social issues like abortion, gay rights, critical race theory, these have all been used as kind of wedge issues to convince people to vote in ways that might be against their own self-interest because they’re just so outraged about this one particular issue.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Yeah, so definitely worth avoiding. What can we do to accomplish that?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Right. That was my question, too. You know, a couple of things: one is that we can just sort of limit how much media we consume. As somebody who is a member of the media, you know, this might sound strange, but I think if you’re feeling constantly overwhelmed and outraged by something, if you consume less of it, that’s probably a good thing.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">But it doesn’t mean you should totally sort of ignore what’s happening. When I talked to William Brady, he said that, you know, one of the ways you can kind of have an impact without just being overwhelmed is to get involved in local politics or local issues, you know, in your community because you can actually have a much greater impact on a local level, usually, than a national level anyway. So rather than just, like, retweeting that most outrageous post that you see, you know, it’s better to get involved with real people and kind of have a dialogue with them.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Yeah, find some mutual aid groups ...</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Find stuff you can actually do when you’re not doomscrolling and hopefully [laughs] ...</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Do less of the doomscrolling, too. And did he have any advice for sort of recovering from outrage burnout once it’s hit you?</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Gosh, that is a good question. You know, it’s not something I specifically asked Dr. Brady about, but I think, just from my own experience, like I said, you know, pulling back a little bit from some of the media consumption and, you know, just maybe limiting yourself to checking the news a couple times a day instead of, like, every hour or, you know, getting those alerts on your phone all the time. If someone is posting stuff that makes you furious all the time, maybe don’t follow them [laughs]. And, yeah, get outside, get in nature—you know, the usual things that can kind of reset your brain and make you feel, you know, more calm.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Yeah, maybe easier said than done, but really good advice. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us, Tanya.</p><p data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"> Thanks so much.

It’s tempting to see cost reducing \ninnovations like s1 or DeepSeek V3 and assume that OpenAI &amp; Anthropic’s vast datacenters are\na waste of money. I’d argue that no, having 10,000 H100s just means that you can do 625 times\n than s1 did.</p><p>If you believe that AI development is a prime national security advantage, then you absolutely\nshould want even more money poured into AI development, to make it go .</p><p>Note that this s1 dataset is . Every example is a thought trace generated by \nanother model, Qwen2.5,\nprompted to think before answering. OpenAI has been accusing DeepSeek of creating their\n<a href=\"https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/tree/main\">V3 model</a> by distilling from o1, which is against their terms of service. There’s still no strong public\nevidence in either direction, so accusations are mostly empty, but s1 gives a lot of credence.</p><p>Going forward, it’ll be nearly impossible to prevent distealing (unauthorized distilling). One thousand\nexamples is definitely within the range of what a single person might do in normal usage, no less \nten or a hundred people. I doubt that OpenAI has a realistic path to  or even \ndistealing outside of simply not releasing models.</p><p>Note that OpenAI released their o3 model as\n<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/\">deep research</a>, an agent instead of direct access to the model API. This might be a trend now,\n“agents” serving as a way to avoid releasing direct access to a model.</p><p>S1 is important because it illustrates the current pace of AI development that’s happening in\nthe open. When you consider how much compute is available to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic,\nthe potential true pace of AI development is .</p><p>S1 isn’t a replication of R1 or o1. Those were demonstrations in pure reinforcement learning (RL).\nS1 shows that supervised fine tuning (SFT) shows just as much potential.

She read books on aviation heroes, watched air disasters, she listened to live air traffic control in her car. Around her neck, she wore an airplane necklace, a gift from a friend that she’d mended repeatedly. In her 20s, she elected to take the plunge and do whatever it took to make it happen. She quit her full-time job, took out student loans, and moved to attend a university that offered a two-year degree as part of the FAA’s collegiate training initiative (CTI) for air traffic controllers. </p><p>The FAA had established its CTI program in 1989, working together alongside a select group of universities and community colleges to build a better-prepared, college-educated workforce. By the early 2010s, when Moranda and other aspiring air traffic controllers entered the program, CTI was the primary way by which people would enter the field, with the FAA accepting virtually no off-the-street hires. On its website, the FAA instructed aspiring air traffic controllers that if they got CTI degrees, passed the profession’s aptitude test (the AT-SAT), and met other eligibility requirements, it would place them into a priority hiring queue, giving them first opportunity every time employment slots opened up. Students understood that the FAA hired virtually everyone who completed the program and passed the assessment.</p><p>As the CTI program ramped up with increasing success in the mid-2000s, Florida State College of Jacksonville applied to join, and in 2008, Sam Fischer launched their program. By 2013, he had settled into a comfortable rhythm, training wave after wave of successful students.</p><p>Andrew Brigida, a 2013 graduate from Arizona State’s CTI program, had just aced the AT-SAT, getting perfect marks while meeting all other job requirements. He was fully qualified, poised to become an air traffic controller.</p><p>First, every past aptitude test applicants had taken was voided. Andrew Brigida’s perfect score was meaningless.</p><p>Second, every applicant would be required to take and pass an unspecified “biographical questionnaire” to have a shot at entering the profession.</p><p>Third, existing CTI students were left with no advantage in the hiring process, which would be equally open to all off-the-street applicants—their degrees rendered useless for the one specialized job they had trained for.</p><p>The rules had changed, and students and program managers alike were left scrambling to figure out what was going on.</p><p>Days after the announcement, Reilly launched a Facebook group for CTI students and instructors to grapple with what was happening. “This page doesn’t support the ‘angry mob’ mentality or anything but positive ‘We believe in CTI schools’ vibes,” she wrote. “We believe that all of the simulator hours spent, materials studied, and education taught in C.T.I. schools has value and is of worth.”</p><p>More than a hundred people joined in the first day. Brigida and Fischer jumped on quickly, helping Reilly to organize the group and walking the anxious crowd through everything they were learning. Fischer provided status updates, Reilly jumped in with rallying cries and organization (“Save CTI! Save CTI! Save CTI!”), and Brigida gave the group a public face. The next hiring wave would be in February 2014, and the CTI graduates and students waited anxiously, grasping at every bit of information they could find to understand what was going on. </p><p>As the hiring wave approached, some of Reilly’s friends in the program encouraged her to join the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE), telling her it would help improve her chances of being hired. She signed up as the February wave started. Soon, though, she became uneasy with what the organization was doing, particularly after she and the rest of the group got a voice message from FAA employee Shelton Snow:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://kaisoapbox.com/projects/faa_biographical_assessment/\" rel=\"\">here</a></p><p>Reilly, Brigida, and thousands of others found themselves faced with the questionnaire, clicking through a bizarre sequence of questions that would determine whether they could enter the profession they’d been working towards. Faced with the opportunity to cheat, Reilly did not. It cost her a shot at becoming an air traffic controller. Like 85% of their fellow CTI students, Brigida and Reilly found themselves faced with a red exclamation point and a dismissal notice: “Based upon your responses to the Biographical Assessment, we have determined that you are NOT eligible for this position.”</p><p>Their plans had been upended. No chance for appeal. No way around it short of waiting another year and trying again. Despite their qualifications and their passion, they would not be air traffic controllers.</p><p><strong>“You Have Been Intentionally Discriminated Against.”</strong></p><p>So what happened? Why did the FAA upend a stable hiring process, undercut the CTI schools it had established to train its workforce, and throw the plans of thousands of eager would-be air traffic controllers into disarray? I give a bare-bones accounting of the background in another article, but there are a few more details worth adding in this one.</p><p>The CTI program was popular and successful before the barrier analysis. After 2013, though, the FAA began to treat its CTI schools as a liability. After the biographical questionnaire, per conversations with CTI administrators, the FAA simply tried to pretend the CTI schools did not exist. The FAA cut off communication, treating them tersely and with disdain. </p><p>The schools were not bastions of privilege. The programs were often at community colleges and junior colleges, with diverse student bodies and professors who worked long hours helping them. They were successful and effective at what they did, and had provided a steady stream of applicants who saw a clear path into the profession. Suddenly, though, they were left scrambling to justify their existence. Fischer talks about how he used to get lots of calls from students asking how to become an air traffic controller, but after 2013, that mostly stopped. He emphasizes that the FAA was never there to give him a job, and if they wanted to change, that was their prerogative. A lot of the problem, and a lot of the sore feelings between the FAA and the CTI schools, came because of the abruptness of the change, the lack of communication, the sudden cutting off.</p><p>Fischer, alongside other program directors like Joe Eichelberger, began to organize the CTI schools and take meticulous notes. What were success rates like before the scandal? What about after? What had happened, and why? How could they continue to justify their programs to students who could no longer trust that there would be jobs waiting at the other end? </p><p><a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/aviation-subcommittee-chair-lobiondo-blasts-faa-hiring-practices\" rel=\"\">gave a few remarks</a></p><blockquote><p>It’s an incredible safety concern… what we’re dealing with here is a shortage of air traffic controllers. We had a process by which to provide candidates, who were very well-qualified, who were spending a lot of money on their own… and the FAA has apparently decided to arbitrarily abandon that process. And now when you add onto it the cheating scandal, which clearly is a huge problem, and an FAA official who is trying to pretend it’s not part of what they have to worry about… that’s ludicrous.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=A161A3ED-E45E-4D32-B711-E60FB67B6028\" rel=\"\">a letter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1753433850594697276\" rel=\"\">more specifically</a></p><p>All of this is included in the investigation report.</p><p>Why do we have access to the questionnaire, the investigation report, and other critical documents necessary to pull together this story? Ask Jorge Rojas. </p><p>Jorge Rojas always wanted to be an air traffic controller. He went to CTI school right after high school and saw all of the 2014 chaos from a distance. In 2015, when he became eligible to take the questionnaire, he did so. Failed. Took it again in 2016. Failed. It was only after Congress explicitly passed a law rejecting the FAA’s use of the biographical questionnaire that he had an opportunity to enter the role. He worked for the FAA for five years before returning to become a government contractor. But he was frustrated—frustrated on his behalf, frustrated on the behalf of others who had had their lives thrown into turmoil. So he began filing FOIA requests.</p><p>Rojas filed hundreds of requests over the course of multiple years. The FAA delayed some, rejected others, and per Rojas, took the stance that “he’s not going to sue us for all of them.” Sometimes, he even went back to FOIA his FOIAs, to see what was taking so long and how they were responding. Five separate times, he took the FAA to court over refusals and delays.</p><p>After long delays and repeated sanctions, the FAA finally produced some of the key documents. He got the questionnaire, the answer key. He got the investigation into Shelton Snow. As of last year when I spoke with him, the FAA was still gradually, periodically, releasing documents to him, responding to FOIAs from back in 2016. </p><p>Along the whole way, Michael Pearson, soon aided by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, worked diligently on the case. Mountain States Legal Foundation is a small non-profit firm; the case is an ambitious one. They have spent years gathering evidence, arguing in court, pushing for class certification, and preparing to bring the case to trial. The case is scheduled to go to trial next year. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/immediate-assessment-of-aviation-safety/\" rel=\"\">a memorandum</a></p><p>Caleb Benner, who graduated in 2012 from Purdue University’s Aviation Management program, one of the FAA’s designated CTI programs, spent his entire childhood dreaming of becoming an air traffic controller. When other kids responded “firefighter” or “police officer” when asked “What do you want to do when you grow up?”, he always said “air traffic controller.” He took the AT-SAT after graduation and got a score in the high 90s, only for hiring to be hit by sequestration before he could apply. When they came out of sequestration and he was preparing to apply properly, he learned about the Biographical Assessment after the New Year’s Eve announcement. He took it. He failed.</p><p>After failing the assessment, he spent multiple years working a job paying $10 an hour, one he specifically chose so it would be easy to uproot and go to the Academy to train when he got the call. The call never came. Eventually, he gave up, paid to get his aircraft dispatcher’s license, and moved on. </p><p>Benner hates that this accident brought the scandal to the forefront after a decade in the courts, and is not fond of how Trump has handled it. But, as he puts it, “That doesn’t change how blatantly wrong it was what the FAA did. And I spent what seems like every day of my career dealing with the consequences of those decisions.”</p><p>Others tell similar stories. Another CTI grad tells me he became a police dispatcher (“to sate my need to talk into a headset for 8 hours a day”) and worked on getting a private rotorcraft license afterward—explained that he didn’t feel bitter, exactly, but he felt wronged. Robbed. </p><p>Reilly has remained a passionate advocate for the issue over the years. She reached out to me almost immediately after I published my original article, providing an extensive look at the years of conversations, advocacy, and work the scandal has taken. She has moved on to work in air traffic management. She remains a passionate advocate for women in aviation and spends time volunteering on youth outreach programs. Last year, she organized an event at the Reagan airport in DC, busing in 150 girls from a Title 1 school. Many, she said, had never seen an airplane up close before. </p><p>In a moment of dark irony, the sort of diversity-focused work she’s passionate about—not lowering the bar, but inspiring more people and providing them with mentorship and opportunity to reach it—is threatened by Trump’s memorandum. </p><p>Has this had a long-term impact on aviation safety and air traffic controller shortages? Likely yes. </p><p>An active air traffic controller reached out to me at the end of January last year, talking about his frustration that so many qualified individuals were eliminated from entering training, contributing to a dire staffing shortage. His facility was operating at less than 75%, with controllers fatigued from working 6-day weeks. As he explained it, training can take 1.5 to 2.5 years at larger facilities, with washout rates from 30-60%, and when we spoke upper level facilities were only accepting transfers from lower level facilities, adding years to preparation time. Every issue compounds and adds to the problem over time, and the FAA’s 2013 changes set staffing back years. The FAA, he said, simply is not bringing in enough people to match the number leaving, with some air traffic controllers believing the agency is failing on purpose to find an excuse to privatize them. </p><p>A controller who worked for 25 years and retired in 2015 spoke with me last January as well. He had been offered a position at Oklahoma City to instruct new students. Per him, the ideal candidate can go from street to fully certified in about 4 years, while some trainees during his last few years had been training for 6-8 years. He alleged a pattern where some students were trained for years longer than others, rarely washed out, and were quietly checked out and promoted away from direct air traffic control positions into management.</p><p>Another retired controller and supervisor who formerly worked at the Chicago ARTCC echoed his story, claiming the FAA would regularly change the “best qualified list,” with those responsible for promotions changing requirements depending on who they wanted to promote. He was never told to certify an inadequate trainee, he said, but “the pressure was mounting.”</p><p>Applicant quality matters in several ways. Weaker applicants are more likely to drop out in training, to take longer going through the pipeline and in on-the-job training (where experienced controllers have to work directly with them, taking other bodies off the job), and to wind up working in less busy airfields. This matters particularly because there are fixed numbers each year and the pipeline takes several years to get through, so real problems take a few years to filter through the pipeline and be felt. </p><p>The 2014 change materially shifted applicant quality on net. While it is technically and tautologically true that everyone who makes it through training is qualified, the “qualified” bar on the AT-SAT eliminated very few candidates, with quality maintained mostly by the “well qualified” bar. Higher scores were genuinely predictive of better performance, and 2014 shifted applicant population. </p><p>Not only that, it shattered the pipeline the FAA had built with CTI schools, making the process towards becoming an air traffic controller less certain, undercutting many of the most passionate people working to train prospective controllers, and leading to a tense and unclear relationship between the FAA and feeder organizations. </p><p>Did anyone truly unqualified make it all the way through the pipeline? There's no reason to think so. Did average candidate quality decrease? There's every reason to think so. Would that lead to staffing issues? Unambiguously yes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/business/air-traffic-controllers-safety.html\" rel=\"\">New York Times</a></p><p>As I write this story, we are in a moment of intense partisan divide, with everyone mad and very few terribly inclined to give grace or look for nuance. In part because of that, I don’t think this story can be treated as complete without making the undercurrent of its interaction with political partisanship clear and speaking directly to those sympathetic to one side or the other.</p><p>I dislike Trump as much as anyone. Maybe I’m not supposed to play my hand like that while reporting a news article, but it’s true. I’ve wanted him out of politics since he entered the scene a decade ago, I voted against him three elections in a row, and I think he’s had a uniquely destructive effect within US politics. So I understand—please believe, I understand—just how disquieting it is to watch him stand up and blame DEI after a major tragedy. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/02/business/air-traffic-controllers-safety.html\" rel=\"\">a thoroughly reported article on air traffic controller shortages</a></p><p>The class members have mixed sentiments as things stand. Some are thrilled that what they see as the scourge of destructive DEI initiatives is finally being addressed. Others are liberals who are frustrated and hurt that something they worked so hard to keep nonpartisan, a real scandal that hurt them, can now be little but a partisan wedge, and they’re not happy with the way Trump is handling it.</p><p>Trump isn’t handling the scandal how I would, but when is that not true? I expect collateral damage, I expect intense partisanship and noise, I expect chaos. But at the core, fundamentally, I can’t be unhappy that after a decade, a President finally brought attention to the scandal. </p><p>I realize political expediency makes talking about the scandal a losing battle for Democrats now that the Biden admin declined to fix it, but a lot of the class members were badly hoping it could be resolved in a nuanced bipartisan way. It's a partisan cudgel right now because the FAA elected to sweep it under the rug for three administrations in a row rather than frankly and honestly cutting out the rot.</p><p>Fundamentally, people should not be forced to choose between “burn it all down” and “sweep it under the rug.” People should not be forced to choose between lowering the bar and rejecting all outreach to struggling communities. Given the recent election, Democrats have years to build a vision of diversity that involves providing more opportunities for everyone to reach a high bar, not lowering the bar—one that involves making institutions work, not obfuscating institutional failure until it can no longer be hidden. </p><p>The time is right for this, and not only can it happen, it should happen. The right way to draw a contrast with Trump is not denying that there was ever an issue, but showing that people who fundamentally believe in the value of institutions and in extending opportunity to a diverse citizenship understand the issues and are prepared to solve them better than bomb-throwers ever could. </p><p>Finally, to conservatives: </p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1884989215244460398\" rel=\"\">Drink my lib tears</a><a href=\"https://x.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1750752522917027983\" rel=\"\">Steve Sailer</a></p><p>All of that is true. But please, as you’re handling this—as you’re digging up the corruption, understanding the failure, rooting through the mess—remember that without principled, brave, honest people like Moranda Reilly, all of this might have stayed hidden forever. It all could have died in obscurity. Remember that at root, this really is a bipartisan issue, and many of the class members really do believe in the value of diversity programs that provide a wider range of people opportunity to meet a high bar. </p><p>I know Democrats had a chance to clean it up, and they didn’t, and now you’re going to do things your way. I get that. But please remember the people at the root, and remember that it took a whole lot more than just conservatives to fight this. </p>","contentLength":19008,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42944203"},{"title":"Beej's Guide to Git","url":"https://beej.us/guide/bggit/","date":1738714044,"author":"mixto","guid":207,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Please keep in mind that I'm only human and there is a\n            very, very high probability that there are errors in this\n            guide.

Congress, dominated by the ruling party, approved last Wednesday a confusing reform to the Bitcoin Law at the request of Bukele’s government, which had no other option to receive the $1.4 billion credit agreed in December with the International Monetary Fund (<a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IMF</a>).</p><p>The reform eliminated the word “currency” when referring to bitcoin, but says it is “<a href=\"https://ticotimes.net/2021/09/07/in-world-first-bitcoin-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal tender</a>.” Despite the lack of clarity, it lifts, as required by the IMF, the obligation to accept it in transactions or debt payments, a key condition for it to be “legal tender,” according to economic analysts. With the change, “if someone owes you money and wants to pay you in bitcoin, you can refuse to be paid in bitcoin, but you cannot refuse if it’s legal tender,” economist Carlos Acevedo explained.</p><p>The use of bitcoin in El Salvador’s dollarized economy, according to the new rule, will be optional and will be at the discretion of the private sector to accept cryptocurrency payments for goods and services. Businesses are no longer required to convert dollar prices into this cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin no longer has that force of legal tender. That’s how it should have always remained, but the government wanted to force it and it didn’t work,” economist Rafael Lemus said.</p><p>The Bitcoin Law reform will take effect 90 days after it’s published in the Official Gazette, which could happen in the coming days. For Acevedo, former president of the former Central Bank, “it makes no sense” to have left in the reformed law that it is “legal tender.” “It’s a monstrosity that’s not understood and that should be corrected and made clear that bitcoin is no longer legal tender,” the economist argues.</p><p>But even being so, Salvadorans, with the exception of a few, never embraced Bukele’s initiative, who enjoys enormous popularity for his war against gangs, which dropped homicides to historic lows in El Salvador. A recent survey by the Central American University (UCA) revealed that 92% of Salvadorans did not use bitcoin in their transactions in 2024.</p><p>“I used it and didn’t like it… Very complicated and risky. This is not for an employee who barely gets by on their salary,” Juana Henríquez, a 55-year-old nurse, said, saying she had tried to make some profit and instead lost money. Bukele also failed to achieve his project, which he announced with fireworks, to create Bitcoin City, a high-tech city that would be the capital of bitcoiners in the country and would take energy for mining from a volcano in Conchagua, about 200 km from Salvador.</p><p>Berlin, a city 110 km east of San Salvador, and <a href=\"https://ticotimes.net/2025/01/31/trump-effect-drives-bitcoin-growth-in-small-el-salvador-town\">El Zont</a><a href=\"https://ticotimes.net/2025/01/31/trump-effect-drives-bitcoin-growth-in-small-el-salvador-town\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">e beach</a> (southwest) are two areas that concentrate bitcoiners, but many are foreign residents or tourists.</p><p>Bitcoin’s biggest promoter in the country, Bukele, has not yet referred to the legal reform. But officials ensure that the government will continue betting on this cryptocurrency, whose price currently exceeds $100,000. El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, told journalists Thursday, during a bitcoin event in San Salvador, that the law reforms should be seen as an adaptation “to the circumstances.”</p><p>The government, she assured, will continue buying bitcoin and having reserves in this cryptocurrency. According to the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has 6,050 bitcoins worth $634.8 million. “President Bukele continues buying bitcoin, we have a Bitcoin Office, we have the Bitcoin Law, bitcoin can be used in El Salvador. It hasn’t been an easy road,” Mayorga summarized.</p><p>For Lemus, because “the government has its bitcoin reserve and will buy more” it is necessary “to have transparency, for citizens to know how public funds are being invested.” Bukele recently said he is convinced that with Donald Trump – whom he supports – in the White House there will be “an exponential revaluation” of the cryptocurrency. He frequently posts price increases on his social networks. For now, he remains silent.</p>","contentLength":4231,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42925210"},{"title":"Httptap: View HTTP/HTTPS requests made by any Linux program","url":"https://github.com/monasticacademy/httptap","date":1738600125,"author":"alexflint","guid":201,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919909"},{"title":"The young, inexperienced engineers aiding DOGE","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/","date":1738523533,"author":"medler","guid":200,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Coristine, as WIRED <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-tech-workers-gsa-tts/\">previously reported</a>, appears to have recently graduated from high school and to have been enrolled at Northeastern University.

Take a look for yourself! This made me come up with an idea to track myself down externally, e.g. to buy my geolocation data leaked by some application. </p><p>After more than couple dozen hours of trying, here are the main takeaways: </p><ol><li>I found a couple requests sent by my phone with + 5 requests that leak , which can be turned into geolocation using reverse DNS. </li><li>Learned a lot about the RTB (real-time bidding) auctions and OpenRTB protocol and was shocked by the amount and types of data sent with the bids to ad exchanges. </li><li>Gave up on the idea to buy my location data from a data broker or a tracking service, because I don't have a big enough company to take a trial or $10-50k to buy a huge database with the data of millions of people + me. Well maybe I do, but such expense seems a bit irrational. <p>Turns out that EU-based peoples` data is almost the most expensive. </p></li></ol><p>But still, I know my location data was collected and I know where to buy it! </p><p>My setup for this research included:</p><ul><li>My old iPhone 11 restored to factory defaults + new apple id. Felt too uncomfortable to do all this on my current phone. </li><li>Charles Proxy to record all traffic coming in and out. I set up the SSL certificate on the iPhone to decrypt all https traffic.</li><li>A simple game called Stack by KetchApp - I remember playing it at school 10-12 years ago. Choosing it as a lab rat felt nostalgic. To my surprise, there were a lot of KetchApp games on the list. </li></ul><p>Ok, here we go: only 1 app installed without the default Apple ones, Charles on, launching Stack in 3, 2, 1.... </p><p>These are the requests that the app sends in the first minute after launch. Take a look at the timing of the requests - almost every split second. </p><p>Let's take a look at the contents of the requests. I actually checked every single one of them - but I'll leave out only the interesting ones here. </p><p>Let's start with the juiciest request sent to <code>https://o.isx.unity3d.com</code> - the first one that included my geo, while I <strong>disabled Location Services</strong> on iPhone for all apps! If you are as naive as I was before this, you might be surprised - what does Unity, the 3D engine, have to do with the in-app advertisement or location tracking? <p>Perhaps that's just some monitoring data to help improve the engine? </p></p><p>Turns out that Unity's main revenue stream (they made $2 bln+ in 2023) is Unity Ads - \"Mobile Game Ad Network\". Sounds quite interesting.</p><p>Below is the request body in json format sent to Unity Ads. I will only leave the  fields worth mentioning - the actual size is 200+ keys. </p><pre><code>{\n  \"ts\": \"2025-01-18T23:27:39Z\", // Timestamp\n  \"c\": \"ES\", // Country code,\n  \"d\": \"sports.bwin.es\", // Domain; the app or website where the ad will be displayed.\n  \"bn\": \"molocoads-eu-banner\", // WTF is moloco ads? We'll see!\n  \"cip\": \"181.41.[redacted]\", // my IP !!\n  \"dm\": \"iPhone12,1\", \n  \"ct\": \"2\", // Connection type; e.g., Wi-Fi\n  \"car\": \"Yoigo\", // mobile network operator\n  \"ifv\": \"6B00D8E5-E37B-4EA0-BB58-[redacted]\", // ID for Vendor.

Wonderful! </p><div><div>As a quick note - location shared was not very precise (but still in the same postal index), I guess due to the fact that iPhone was connected to WiFi and had no SIM installed. If it was LTE, I bet the lat/lon would be much more precise. </div></div><h3>Hello Facebook... What are you doing here?</h3><p>Next interesting request that leaks my IP + timestamp (= geo-datapoint) is Facebook.What?!</p><ul><li>I don't have any Meta [Facebook] app installed on this iPhone</li><li>I didn't link the app nor my Apple ID to any Facebook account</li><li>I didn't consent to Facebook getting my IP address!</li></ul><pre><code>{ \n\t\"bundles\": {\n\t\t\"bidder_token_info\": {\n\t\t\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"bt_extras\": {\n                  \"ip\":\"181.41.[redacted], // nice Extras, bro\n                  \"ts\":1737244649\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"fingerprint\": null\n\t\t},\n        {\n          \"a lot of data: yes a loooooooot\"\n         }</code></pre><p>We'll talk more about this one in the next section. </p><h3>Why do you need my screen brightness level? </h3><pre><code>{\n  \"osVersion\":\"16.7.1\",\n  \"connectionType\":\"wifi\",\n  \"eventTimeStamp\":1737244651,\n  \"vendorIdentifier\":\"6B00D8E5-E37B-[redacted]\", // ifv once again \n  \"wiredHeadset\":false, // excuse me? \n  \"volume\":0.5,\n  \"cpuCount\":6,\n  \"systemBootTime\":1737215978,\n  \"batteryStatus\":3,\n  \"screenBrightness\":0.34999999403953552,\n  \"freeMemory\":507888,\n  \"totalMemory\":3550640, // is this RAM?\n  \"timeZone\":\"+0100\",\n  \"deviceFreeSpace\":112945148\n  \"networkOperator\":\"6553565535\"\n  \"advertisingTrackingId\":\"00000000-0000....\", // interesting ...\n  }</code></pre><p>There's no \"personal information\" here, but honestly this amount of data shared with an arbitrary list of 3rd parties is scary. Why do they need to know my screen brightness, memory amount, current volume and if I'm wearing headphones? </p><p>I know the \"right\" answer - to help companies target their audience better! For example, if you're promoting a mobile app that is 1 GB of size, and the user only has 500 MB of space left - don't show him the ad, right?</p><p>But I also heard lots of controversies on this topic. Like Uber dynamically adjusting taxi price based on your battery level - because you're not waiting for a cheaper option with 4% left while standing in the street. </p><p>I can't know if that or another one is true. But the fact that this data is available and accessible by advertisers suggests that they should at least think of using it. </p><p>Ok, enough with the requests. We can already see the examples of different ip and geolocation leaks.  + timestamp was adjust.com - but the request body was too boring to include. </p><p>You might've already noticed  and  ==  in the requests above - what are those? </p><p>IFV, or IDFV, is \"ID for Vendor\". This is my id unique for each vendor, a.k.a developer - in this case, KetchApp. <p>This checks out: I installed another KetchApp game to quickly record the requests, and the </p> value was the same for it. </p><p>Advertising Tracking ID, on the other hand, is the cross-vendor value, the one that is shared with an app if you choose \"Allow app to track your activity across ...\". As you can see above, it was actually set to  because I \"Asked app not to track\". </p><p>I checked this by manually disabling and enabling tracking option for the Stack app and comparing requests in both cases. </p><h3><strong>And that's the only difference between allowing and disallowing tracking</strong></h3><p>I understand there might be nothing shocking to you in it - this is not really kept secret, you can go and check the docs for Apple developers, for example. </p><p>But I believe this is  communicated correctly to the end users, you and me, in any adequate way, shape or form: the free apps you install and use <strong>collect your precise location</strong> with timestamp and send it to some 3rd-party companies. </p><p>The only thing that stops anyone with access to bid data (yet another ad buying agent, or ad exchange, or a dataset bought or rented from data broker, as you'll see later) from tracking you down with all trips you make daily is this  that is not shared when you disallow apps to \"track you across apps\" to \"enhance and personalise your ads experience\". </p><p>By the way: if you're using 10 apps from the same vendor (Playrix, KetchApp or another 1000-app company) and allow  to track you – it would mean that the data collected in all 10 apps will be enriched with your IDFA which can later be exchanged to your personal data. </p><p>At the same time, there is so much data in the requests that I'd expect ad exchanges to find some loophole ID that would allow cross-app tracking without the need for IDFA. I found at least 20 ids like  and ,  and  (these 2 are shared with Facebook), and so on. </p><p>By the way, the fact that Facebook collected my IP + timestamp without any adequate consent / app connection from my end is crazy. I think Facebook is more than capable of connecting the dots and my Meta Account to this hit as soon as I login to Instagram or Facebook app on the same IP address. </p><p>Let's get back to the request that leaked my location for a second and look at its trace. We'll focus on the parties in the middle:</p><p>stack<strong> →  o.isx.unity3d.com → molocoads →</strong> bwin (advertiser)</p><p>Unity [ads] is an SSP (supply-side platform) that acts as a collector of data from the app via SDK. As an app developer, you don't need to worry about gathering the right data, registering as a publisher on an ad exchange or whatever - just install the SDK and receive the money. </p><p>Moloco ads is a DSP network that resells data from multiple SSPs (like Unity, Applovin, Chartboost). Basically, from almost every one of the requested hosts I've seen pop up in Charles Proxy.It then applies some \"smart optimisation\" and connects a vacant banner space on your phone screen with the advertiser.</p><p>Sounds like moloco aggregates a lot of data and basically anyone (<em>- any company that becomes an ad partner</em>) can access the data by bidding lower than others. Or imagine a real ad exchange that bids normally and collects all of the data along the way \"as a side gig\". <p>Basically, this is how intelligence companies and data brokers get their data. </p></p><p>At this point I was looking for any mentions of Moloco on Telegram and Reddit, and I ran into <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/rqlr36/eli5_what_is_the_controversy_behind_bidstream?ref=timsh.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this post</a> that answered a lot of my questions:</p><blockquote>They access it if they integrate with the provider of bidstream, which would be the SSP. It's on the SSP to verify the vendor to whom they give access to bids. Usually, the requirement would be that you actually... bid. SSPs want you to spend money, that's how their business makes revenue. They might open up only part of the traffic to specific vendors (i.e.. if you don't bid worldwide, you won't get the bidstream worldwide, only in the regions in which you operate).</blockquote><p>Let's move further. When I found out how the data gets out, I started looking for any place where it's being sold. It was a quick search.</p><p>I found a data marketplace called <a href=\"https://datarade.ai/data-categories/device-graph-data?ref=timsh.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Datarade</a> which is a panel with all sorts of data. When I searched for MAID-specific data, hundreds of options showed up, like these two: </p><p>The price of the Redmob dataset surprised me, - $120k a year... for what?Let's now take a look at their promo:</p><p>Check out the list of features on the right - do any of them look familiar? : \"low latency\" means they know your location from the last time any of the apps shared it.

She archived whatever she could.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The full scope of the purge isn’t yet clear. One document obtained by  indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several “suggested keywords”—including “pregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [], non-binary [], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns”—in CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities—making it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">CDC data’s “explicit purpose” is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, “it’s hard to understand how this benefits health.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">When I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that “all changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump’s January 20 Executive Orders” on gender and DEI.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without “changing the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,” and that any such changes should be considered “routine.” Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">“My fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,” then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, “so we know where to target our health interventions.” She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-stis-and-gay-men.html\">higher rates of STIs</a>, but <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9067055/\">lower rates of obesity</a>; transgender women have <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/transgender-women-hiv-socioeconomic-risks-cdc/\">higher rates of HIV</a>, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country’s ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to “erasing our ability to use data and evidence” to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing “gender” with “sex,” or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States’ 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. “Officials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,” Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/health/syphilis-gonorrhea-chlamydia-cdc.html\">plateau</a> in the U.S., after decades of steady increase—but altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that “provides a justification to cut funding,” one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government’s actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that’s an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they’d be in a position where they’d have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.</p>","contentLength":6778,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897696"},{"title":"Add \"fucking\" to your Google searches to neutralize AI summaries","url":"https://gizmodo.com/add-fcking-to-your-google-searches-to-neutralize-ai-summaries-2000557710","date":1738358440,"author":"jsheard","guid":195,"unread":true,"content":"<p>If you are tired of Google’s AI-powered search results leading you astray with poor information from bad sources, there is some good news.

If you instead search, “How large is the fucking student body at Yale University?” you will instead get a standard list of blue link results, sans-AI summary.</p><p>This is not the first time internet sleuths have discovered a way to disable Google’s AI-powered results. Other methods are more complicated, however, like adding a specific string of characters to the search results page URL.

Google search results have never been perfect, of course—there is still a lot of poor information across the web. But AI summaries present users with a prominent blurb at the top of their search that looks authoritative when it just risks compounding the misinformation problem with more erroneous slop.</p><p>It is the same way Siri has been made worse by its integration with ChatGPT. At least in the past, when the voice assistant did not know how to answer a question it would just throw users to the web. Now Siri offers up ChatGPT-generated responses instead, sometimes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/siri-eagles-33-false-super-bowl-wins-basic-test/\">spitting out incorrect nonsense</a> instead of admitting it is not sure.

Google has likely trained Gemini to avoid repeating expletives, so it simply is disabled in search when a curse word is present in order to avoid that.</p><p>Google has argued that AI Overviews, as they are called, do not reduce traffic sent to websites because users will view summaries and be interested in delving deeper into the source material after finding something of interest.
