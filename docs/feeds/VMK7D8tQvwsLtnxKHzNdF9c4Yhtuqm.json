Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.</p><h2><a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors#the-basics-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-theory\"></a>The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory</h2><p>Dynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which\ncould be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that\ndetermine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is\nhappening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a\npopulation (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.</p><p>There are two primary things to understand about this system:</p><ul><li>: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a\nsnapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .</li><li>: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be\nrepresented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.</li></ul><p>For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size\nand the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population\ndynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate\nthe changes in population size over time.</p><p>Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of\npossibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,\nstudy systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in\nrelevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.</p><p>There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to\nchaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability.</p><p> is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional\ndeterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop\nof ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,\npendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.</p><p>Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow\ndeterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,\nmight seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of\nthe time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex\nsystems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information\nto make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.</p><p>Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially\nobserve) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a\ncompletely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the\nbutterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .</p><p>To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems\nare all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the\nphase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,\ntowards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.</p><p>For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the\nbottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.</p><p>This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of\nthe reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:</p><ul><li>: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay\nthere. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.</li><li>: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This\nloss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is\nwhat happens in the case of the pendulum.</li><li>: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This\ncontraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn\ntowards the attractor.</li></ul><p>Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These\nnonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These\ncomplex attractors are categorised as . They are called \"strange\" due to their unique\ncharacteristics.</p><ol><li>: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate\npatterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.</li><li><strong>Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions</strong>: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial\nconditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known\nas the \"butterfly effect\".</li><li><strong>Unpredictable Trajectories</strong>: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting\nnon-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by\ndeterministic rules.</li><li><strong>Emergent Order from Chaos</strong>: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.\nPatterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.</li></ol><p>You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the\nbutterfly effect.</p><blockquote><p>A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.</p></blockquote><p>One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small\nchanges in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the\n. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to\ndrastically different outcomes.</p><p>In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:</p><p>A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the\nattractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.</p><p>There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to\n in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles\neventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.</p><p>This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a\ntechnique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,\nminimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One\nstores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs):</strong> We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and\nnext state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use\nof GPU resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics:</strong> The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to\neach particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rendering and Buffer Swapping:</strong> In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's\nequations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously\ninactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.</p></li></ol><p>This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.</p><p>If you have any comments, please leave them on <strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/shashanktomar/blog-discussion/discussions/1\">this GitHub discussions topic</a></strong>.

Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.</p><p>The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.</p><p>For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.</p><h2>Why We Explored a New Approach</h2><p>When LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the <a href=\"https://source.coop/harvard-lil/gov-data/\">Data.gov Archive</a>, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.</p><p>This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit <a href=\"https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2024/03/26/transitions-for-the-caselaw-access-project/\">a transition moment</a>. At that time, we elected to switch <a href=\"http://case.law\">case.law</a> to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.</p><p>CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?</p><h2>Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server Required</h2><p>Recent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/docs/api/wasm/\">DuckDB-Wasm</a>, <a href=\"https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/\">sql.js-httpvfs</a>, and <a href=\"https://protomaps.com\">Protomaps</a>, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.</p><p>We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li> We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting.</li><li> Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser.</li><li> When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.</li></ul><p>This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like <a href=\"https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet\">hyparquet</a> and <a href=\"https://idl.uw.edu/arquero\">Arquero</a> to further improve performance.</p><p>Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.</p><h2>Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and Beyond</h2><p>This new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes:</p><ul><li> By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.</li><li><strong>Reduced technical overhead:</strong> With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern.</li><li> Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.</li></ul><p>Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world:</p><ul><li> If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting.</li><li> Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.</li></ul><p>This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us. We’re committed to open sharing as we refine our tools, and we welcome collaboration or feedback at <a href=\"mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu\">lil@law.harvard.edu</a>.</p>","contentLength":5646,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45774571"},{"title":"Just use a button","url":"https://gomakethings.com/just-use-a-button/","date":1761929962,"author":"moebrowne","guid":224,"unread":true,"content":"<p>One of the weirdest “debates” I seem to perpetually have with framework-enthusiastic developers is whether or not a  is “just as good” as a .</p><p> it’s not.

Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, \"We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information.\"</p><p>All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/gdpr-an-executive-guide-to-what-you-need-to-know/\">EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.&nbsp;</p><p>Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the <a href=\"https://openinfra.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">OpenInfra Foundation</a> recently suggested: \"Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration.\" &nbsp;</p><p>While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months.

That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.</p><p>The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in Austria, the <a href=\"https://www.derstandard.de/story/3000000293383/prozentzeichen-statt-bundesadler-wie-die-justiz-ihre-it-umstellt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice</a>. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an \"unprofessional, rushed operation.\" Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems.&nbsp;</p><p>The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.</p><p>That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector. However, as Austria's Justice Ministry experience has shown, simply shifting to an open-source approach without careful planning can get in the way of getting work done.&nbsp;</p>","contentLength":3746,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45773974"},{"title":"AI scrapers request commented scripts","url":"https://cryptography.dog/blog/AI-scrapers-request-commented-scripts/","date":1761925459,"author":"ColinWright","guid":222,"unread":true,"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45773347"},{"title":"Ask HN: Who uses open LLMs and coding assistants locally?

However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.</p><p>Lewis is the senior author of the study, which <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8\" target=\"_blank\">appears today</a> in . MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang&nbsp;is the lead author of the paper.</p><p>Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.</p><p>During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax5440\" target=\"_blank\">study</a>, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.</p><p>That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.</p><p>In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.</p><p>During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.</p><p>The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.</p><p>Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.</p><p>During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.</p><p>“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.</p><p>The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow&nbsp;come with the cost of attention loss.</p><p>“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”</p><p>The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.</p><p>“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.</p><p>This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.</p><p>“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.</p><p>In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.</p><p>The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.</p>","contentLength":6622,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771636"},{"title":"How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html","date":1761915826,"author":"reaperducer","guid":219,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology.

What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.</p><p>Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.</p><p>Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.</p><p>Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.</p><p>Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.</p><figure></figure><p>From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than  into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying  needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.</p><p>(The New York Times has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html\">sued</a> OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)</p><figure></figure><p>By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.</p><p>Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than  for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received  in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.</p><figure></figure><p>OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a  investment in OpenAI.</p><p>At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising  to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.</p><figure></figure><p>Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend  building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these  over the next several years.</p><figure></figure><p>The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly  for OpenAI in the Emirates.</p><figure></figure><p>Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest  in OpenAI over the next several years.

That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.</p><p>OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.</p><p>If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.</p><p>In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.</p>","contentLength":4718,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771538"},{"title":"My Impressions of the MacBook Pro M4","url":"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/","date":1761905620,"author":"secure","guid":191,"unread":true,"content":"<p>I have been using a MacBook Pro M4 as my portable computer for the last half a\nyear and wanted to share a few short impressions. As always, I am not a\nprofessional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just\nsubjective thoughts!</p><p>Back in 2021, I wrote about the <a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-11-28-macbook-air-m1/\">MacBook Air\nM1</a>, which was the first computer I used that\ncontained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery\nlife was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.</p><p>When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year\nold MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more\nyears. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could\nhave stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.</p><h2>The nano-textured display</h2><p>I went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in\nperson. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased\nweight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be\nacceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I\nreally like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro\nowners that the fan mostly stays off.</p><p>In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has\nenough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation\nslots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.</p><p>Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented\nthe trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing\nreflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.</p><p>I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:\nThe bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display\n(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):</p><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays.jpg\"><img srcset=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_8c87fe476c5344b6.jpg 2x,https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_243730d5507ecc98.jpg 3x\" src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-30-macbooks-displays_hu_4cb7e6e8fae8437.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" title=\"MacBook Air (left) vs. MacBook Pro (right)\" width=\"600\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was\nclear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for\nthe nano texture display!</p><p>After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this\nchoice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous\nlaptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next\nto the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.</p><p>(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have\nreleased the first devices with M5 chips.)</p><p>I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4  chip\nbecause I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4\nPro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.</p><p>Here are the specs I ended up with:</p><ul><li>14\" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano texture</li><li>Apple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)</li><li>32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)</li></ul><p>One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it\nis connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for\nhours). I’m not sure why.</p><p>Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once\nin half a year or so?</p><p>The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day\nbattery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,\nwatching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of\nbattery life. I generally never even carry the charger.</p><p>Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector\n(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but\ndoesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to\npack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you\nuse the charger.</p><p>I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I\nmostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,\nfor example, when scrolling.</p><p>One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations\ncan become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on , I\nnoticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120\nHz display!</p><p>The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms\nof processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average\ncase and the worst case):</p><ol><li>Best case: Page load finishes  the next frame is displayed: no delay.</li><li>Worst case: Page load finishes  a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.</li><li>Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delay</li></ol><a href=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\"><img src=\"https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-10-31-macbook-pro-m4-impressions/2025-10-31-delay-60-vs-120.svg\" alt=\"delay\" title=\"delay\" loading=\"lazy\"></a><p>As you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one\nframe every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with\na system that has &lt;8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up\nto) twice as fast!</p><p>I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,\nwhere a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120\nHz displays are more interesting.</p><p>My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)</p><p>I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But\n<a href=\"https://asahilinux.org/\">Asahi Linux</a> still needs some work before it’s usable\nfor me (I need external display output, and M4 support).

Relentless <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/08/11/ices-spectacle-of-intimidation\">documentation</a> has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of ; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping  agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.</p><p>At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/the-conflict-on-the-streets-of-chicago\">in Chicago</a> earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J.&nbsp;B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti- opposition is taking advantage of the internet,  and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent  sweeps of the area.  itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet  found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in ,  also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown  agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where  agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of  abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”</p><p>Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an  field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.</p>","contentLength":5138,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767325"},{"title":"Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture","url":"https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Linear","date":1761869256,"author":"blackcat201","guid":214,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766937"},{"title":"Leaker reveals which Pixels are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking","url":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/","date":1761865930,"author":"akyuu","guid":189,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766501"},{"title":"A change of address led to our Wise accounts being shut down","url":"https://shaun.nz/why-were-never-using-wise-again-a-cautionary-tale-from-a-business-burned/","date":1761864110,"author":"jemmyw","guid":213,"unread":true,"content":"<p>For years, one of my businesses has been a regular user of  (formerly TransferWise).

She told me, flatly:</p><blockquote><p>“I  providing you with the correct information.”</p></blockquote><p>A bit more back and forth… then the call .</p><h2><strong>📞 A Glimmer of Hope – Then The Hammer Falls</strong></h2><p>Later that day, I received a call back from Wise – not from a manager (because apparently, <strong>Wise doesn’t have managers</strong>), but from a more “senior” representative.</p><p>This rep was  and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she’d personally follow up if it was rejected again.</p><h2><strong>🚫 “We’ve Restricted Your Account”</strong></h2><p>I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:</p><blockquote><p><strong>“We’ve restricted your account”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Just like that, our  was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.</p><p>We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:</p><blockquote><p>“Due to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.”</p></blockquote><p>Even worse? My  was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.</p><h2><strong>🧾 An “Appeal” That Wasn’t an Appeal</strong></h2><p>The email offered an option to . Naturally, I did.</p><p>The appeal process asked for our <strong>articles of incorporation</strong> and . No problem.</p><p>Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and <strong>bank account details to refund the balances</strong>.</p><p>Wait… I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?</p><p>That was the end. There was <strong>no opportunity to explain anything</strong>, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were , permanently.</p><p>To summarise the absurdity of this:</p><ul><li>We moved office, and updated our address with Wise</li><li>We provided a legal, NZ-compliant  showing our entity and address</li><li>It was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”</li><li>A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different document</li><li>A senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated it</li><li>Then <strong>our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourse</strong></li></ul><p>Even trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”</p><h2><strong>⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very Careful</strong></h2><p>We had used Wise for . Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that , with no transparency or logical path to resolution.</p><p>We’re not alone – a quick search shows <strong>many others facing similar horror stories</strong> with Wise.</p><p>So this is my word of warning:</p><blockquote><p>💡 <strong>Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least <strong>they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths</strong>.</p><h2>🧾 <strong>28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.</strong></h2><p>Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to  as we had <strong>breached their acceptable use policy</strong>. 🤨</p><p>What was surprising, however, was the  they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:</p><p>I was told my  was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states <em>“you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”</em></p><p>I’ve  used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”</em></p></blockquote><p>What activities?! Again, </p><p>To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer . Why? Because it requires documentation — the  Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a <em>telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill</em>.</p><p>After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.</p><p>So now our , their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to <strong>Financial Services Complaints Ltd</strong>, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.</p><p>Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.</p><p>This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.</p><p><strong>Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.</strong></p>","contentLength":7250,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766253"},{"title":"Phone numbers for use in TV shows, films and creative works","url":"https://www.acma.gov.au/phone-numbers-use-tv-shows-films-and-creative-works","date":1761860951,"author":"nomilk","guid":212,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45765787"},{"title":"Denmark reportedly withdraws Chat Control proposal following controversy","url":"https://therecord.media/demark-reportedly-withdraws-chat-control-proposal","date":1761860142,"author":"layer8","guid":211,"unread":true,"content":"<p> Denmark’s justice minister on Thursday said he will no longer push for an EU law requiring the mandatory scanning of electronic messages, including on end-to-end encrypted platforms. </p><p> Earlier in its European Council presidency, Denmark had brought back a draft law which would have required the scanning, sparking an intense backlash.

Convention against Cybercrime</a> in Hanoi this weekend, a significant step in the yearslong effort to create a global mechanism to counteract digital crime. </p><p> The U.K. and European Union joined China, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria and dozens of other nations in signing the convention, which lays out new mechanisms for governments to coordinate, build capacity and track those who use technology to commit crimes.&nbsp; </p><p> In his speech at the event, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said cyberspace “has become fertile ground for criminals” and has allowed them to “defraud families, steal livelihoods, and drain billions of dollars from our economies.” </p><p> “The UN Cybercrime Convention is a powerful, legally binding instrument to strengthen our collective defences against cybercrime,” Guterres <a href=\"https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k1m/k1mmr6e30l?fbclid=IwY2xjawNsbKBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEaEJoeEdZVm5jOHFrbUZwAR6naDVwPBo0PIG40vUDzWufVp-JMZnPlhXObSoo82Td1voIWEEcVPyLc4VCqw_aem_BZcBFnBsiMKuxTexgtKUBA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>.&nbsp; </p><p> “Illicit flows of money, concealed through cryptocurrencies and digital transactions, finance the trafficking of drugs, arms, and terror. And businesses, hospitals, and airports are brought to a standstill by ransomware attacks.” </p><p> He added that the convention would be critical for governments in the Global South that need assistance and funding for the training required to address cybercrime — which the U.N. estimates costs $10.5 trillion around the world annually.&nbsp; </p><p> While many countries did not sign the treaty, the most notable missing signature was that of the U.S. </p><p> Officials at the State Department <a href=\"https://therecord.media/cybercrime-treaty-signing-hanoi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told Recorded Future News on Friday</a> that Marc Knapper, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, and representatives from the U.S. Mission to Vietnam would be attending the signing.&nbsp; </p><p> The State Department confirmed on Monday that the U.S. did not sign the treaty.&nbsp; </p><p> “The United States continues to review the treaty,” a State Department spokesperson said in a brief statement.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. Convention against Cybercrime was adopted by the General Assembly <a href=\"https://therecord.media/un-general-assembly-approves-cybercrime-treaty-despite-industry-pushback\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in December 2024</a> and will enter into force 90 days after being ratified by the 40th signatory. Signatories will have to ratify the convention according to their own procedures.&nbsp; </p><p> At the ceremony, UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly argued that cybercrime is changing the face of organized crime and required global coordination to address. Waly said the convention would be a “vital tool” that will ensure “a safer digital world for all.” </p><p> U.N. officials said the convention would help governments address terrorism, human trafficking, money laundering and drug smuggling, all of which have been turbo-charged by the internet.&nbsp; </p><p> The U.N. noted that the convention is the first global framework “for the collection, sharing and use of electronic evidence for all serious offenses” — noting that until now there have been no broadly accepted international standards on electronic evidence.&nbsp; </p><p> It is also the first global treaty to criminalize crimes that depend on the internet and is the first international treaty “to recognize the non-consensual dissemination of intimate images as an offense.” </p><p> “It creates the first global 24/7 network where countries can quickly initiate cooperation,” the U.N. said. “It recognizes and promotes the need to build capacity in countries to pursue and cooperate on fast-moving cybercrimes.” </p><p> The convention has been heavily criticized by the tech industry, which has warned that it criminalizes cybersecurity research and exposes companies to legally thorny data requests. </p><p> Human rights groups warned on Friday that it effectively forces member states to create a broad electronic surveillance dragnet that would include crimes that have nothing to do with technology.&nbsp; </p><p> Many expressed concern that the convention will be abused by dictatorships and rogue governments who will deploy it against critics or protesters — even those outside of a regime’s jurisdiction.&nbsp; </p><p> It also creates legal regimes to monitor, store and allow cross-border sharing of information without specific data protections. Access Now’s Raman Jit Singh Chima said the convention effectively justifies “cyber authoritarianism at home and transnational repression across borders.”&nbsp; </p><p> Any countries ratifying the treaty, he added, risks “actively validating cyber authoritarianism and facilitating the global erosion of digital freedoms, choosing procedural consensus over substantive human rights protection.” </p><p> In his speech, Guterres referenced the backlash to the convention, telling member states that the treaty has to be a “promise that fundamental human rights such as privacy, dignity, and safety must be protected both offline and online.”&nbsp; </p><p> But at its core, according to Guterres, the convention solves one of the thorniest issues law enforcement agencies have faced over the last two decades. Countries have only recently begun to share digital evidence across borders but the convention would increase that practice.&nbsp; </p><p> “This has long been a major obstacle to justice — with perpetrators in one country, victims in another, and data stored in a third,” he said. “The Convention provides a clear pathway for investigators and prosecutors to finally overcome this barrier.” </p>","contentLength":5174,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45760328"},{"title":"Show HN: I made a heatmap diff viewer for code reviews","url":"https://0github.com/","date":1761834118,"author":"lawrencechen","guid":183,"unread":true,"content":"<p>0github.com is a pull request viewer that color-codes every diff line/token by how much human attention it probably needs.
