He has a shocking record on abortion and many other issues. He has supported calls to reduce access to healthcare and has even argued for a national ban on abortion rights across the US.</p><p>“Abortion rights are human rights and they are healthcare.

warned US gunmakers they could face fresh legal action as accomplices of organized crime if Washington designates the country’s cartels as terrorist groups.</p><p>The Latin American country, which is under mounting pressure from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">Donald Trump</a> to curb illegal drug smuggling, wants its neighbor to crack down on firearms trafficking in the other direction.</p><p>“If they declare these criminal groups as terrorists, then we’ll have to expand our US lawsuit,” Mexico’s president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/claudia-sheinbaum\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Claudia Sheinbaum</a>, said at a daily press conference.</p><p>A new charge could include alleged complicity of gunmakers with terror groups, she said.</p><p>“The lawyers are looking at it, but they could be accomplices,” Sheinbaum warned.</p><p>She said the US justice department itself has recognized that “74% of the weapons” used by criminal groups in Mexico come from north of the border.</p><p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/state-dept-terrorist-designation.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">the New York Times reported </a>that the US state department plans to classify criminal groups from Mexico, Colombia, El Salvador and Venezuela as “terrorist organizations”.</p><p>Trump signed an executive order on 20 January creating a process for such a designation, saying that the cartels “constitute a national security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime”.</p><p>Mexico says that between 200,000 and 750,000 weapons manufactured by US gunmakers are smuggled across the border from the United States every year, many of which are found at crime scenes.</p><p>The suit was thrown out based on a lack of jurisdiction, though Mexico said at the time that its lawsuit against two manufacturers, Smith and Wesson and Interstate Arms, would continue.</p><p>Another suit brought in the border state of Arizona seeks sanctions against dealers that sold guns used in serious crimes over the border.</p><p>Mexico tightly controls firearm sales, making them practically impossible to obtain legally.</p><p>Even so, drug-related violence led to the deaths of about 480,000 people in Mexico since the government deployed the army to combat trafficking in 2006, according to official figures.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sheinbaum angrily rejected an accusation by the United States that her government was allied with drug cartels.</p><p>“We categorically reject the slander made by the White House against the Mexican government about alliances with criminal organizations,” the president wrote on social platform X at the time.</p><p>“If there is such an alliance anywhere, it is in the US gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups,” she added.</p><p>Tensions between the closely connected neighbors soared after the White House said Trump would slap tariffs of 25% on Mexican and Canadian goods because of illegal immigration and drug smuggling.</p><p>The threatened tariffs have since been halted for 30

Coordination, yes; subordination, no.”</p><p>On Feb. 2, the governors of Mexico’s 31 states and Mexico City backed Sheinbaum in a joint statement.</p><p>“We energetically condemn the accusations that suggest there is a link between our government and narco-trafficking cartels,” it said. “These claims are not only baseless, they also ignore the major, verifiable efforts Mexico has made to combat organized crime,” the statement read.</p><p>Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s economy minister, <a href=\"https://x.com/m_ebrard/status/1886055727862804671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said on X</a>&nbsp;that Trump is hurting himself.</p><div data-shortcode=\"traffickers\">“Accusing the Mexican government of being an ally of narco [traffickers] is — apart from an insult to our country – a pretext to distract US public opinion from the tremendous mistake of imposing disruptive tariffs on Mexico and North American companies that operate here.

Phillips has said the comments made her more worried about her safety.</p><p>“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry writes.</p><p>The letter states the situation is rendered more serious because of Musk’s new position within a Trump administration that, Curry writes, “has over the past several weeks engaged in an assault on scientific research in the US that has fallen foul of federal courts”, noting that concerns have also been raised over censorship, particularly in the realm of climate science</p><p>The letter adds that the lack of comment by the Royal Society about Musk’s fellowship, other than its reiteration that concerns around individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence, “increasingly looks like a failure of moral courage”.</p><p>Curry said he hopes the letter, as well as the recent resignations, would highlight to the Royal Society the breadth and depth of feeling within the scientific community about Musk’s fellowship.</p><p>“If they believe at all in the values that they espouse in their code of conduct, then they really have to come out and explain to people why is it that they think that Musk’s behaviour is consistent with [them],” he said.</p><p>The Guardian understands there is to be a meeting of the Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 March to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Royal Society said: “In the event of any concerns raised about the behaviour of a fellow, the Society has a clear set of processes described in our <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/-/media/about-us/how-we-are-governed/code-of-conduct.pdf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">code of conduct</a>, which is published on our website along with relevant disciplinary regulations. Any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence.’’</p>","contentLength":4242,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ipeju3/royal_society_urged_to_expel_elon_musk_as_fellows/"}],"tags":["news"]}
