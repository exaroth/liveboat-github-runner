This year will be remembered as the one in which that illusion came to an end. We had to accept U.S. tariffs, and we were pushed by our own ally to increase military spending ‚Äì a decision perhaps necessary, but not in this form or at this pace.‚ÄùSpeaking at the 46th Meeting in Rimini, former Prime Minister Mario Draghi continued, ‚Äúthe EU played only a marginal role in peace negotiations over Ukraine. It was a mere spectator even as Iranian nuclear sites were bombed and the massacre in Gaza escalated.‚Äù<p>According to Draghi, ‚ÄúEurope must move from being a spectator, or at best a supporting actor, to becoming a protagonist. That means reshaping its political organization, which is inseparable from its ability to meet economic and strategic goals. Economic reforms remain essential.‚Äù</p>‚ÄúEurope is the best opportunity we have for a future of peace and security. And as a democracy, it is you, it is us, the Europeans who set the priorities,‚Äù Draghi said.<p>On fiscal policy, Draghi repeated his distinction between ‚Äúgood debt and bad debt,‚Äù but warned that in some areas national-level borrowing is no longer sufficient. He argued that only common European debt can finance large-scale projects in defense, energy, and emerging technologies.</p>The former ECB president also pointed to a ‚Äúbrutal wake-up call‚Äù from Donald Trump, which he said reshaped relations with the U.S. ‚ÄúThere is now a political, social, and psychological climate that gives hope for a new kind of political organization. We must learn to cooperate. Rigidity and passivity breed inaction ‚Äì and that, as w√®ve seen over the last 10-15 years, is Europ√®s worst enemy.‚Äù<p>‚ÄúIt is not surprising that skepticism toward Europe has reached new heights,‚Äù Draghi added. ‚ÄúBut it is worth asking what lies at the heart of this skepticism. In my view, it is not directed at the values on which Europe was founded, but rather at the EU‚Äôs ability to defend those values. And that skepticism is partly justified: political structures are designed to address the challenges of their time, and when those challenges change, the structures themselves must change‚Äù.</p></p><div>Vuoi pubblicare i contenuti di Italpress.com sul tuo sito web o vuoi promuovere la tua attivit√† sul nostro sito e su quelli delle testate nostre partner?

Canada might have been able to avoid&nbsp;the hike had it managed to strike a new trade deal with the U.S. by the Aug. 1 deadline, but that didn't happen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Trump administration said the change was in response to fentanyl trafficking and Canada's decision earlier this year to hit back with counter-tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Canadian government imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods three times since the trade war began, including counter-tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. consumer goods and additional tariffs on U.S. autos, steel and aluminum.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The 35 per cent tariff rate only applies to goods not covered by CUSMA.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">First 'nation-building project' to be announced soon</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Carney referenced his conversation with Trump on Thursday, saying he got assurances from the U.S. president that by removing tariffs on U.S. imports&nbsp;compliant with CUSMA, discussions&nbsp;between the two countries will \"intensify\"&nbsp;to address \"trade challenges in strategic sectors\" still impacted by tariffs.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Those discussions, Carney said, will happen alongside efforts to prepare for the official review of CUSMA that will happen next year by holding industry consultations starting next month in order to set priorities.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, suggested to <a href=\"https://gem.cbc.ca/power-politics\" target=\"_blank\">CBC's </a> that walking back the retaliatory tariffs will help ease tensions ahead of the CUSMA review.</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;LeBlanc says Canada has 'lots of cards' in negotiations with U.S.:</strong></em></div><p dir=\"ltr\">\"We have to get to that conversation in the most coherent posture possible and the prime minister's decision today very much lines up in that way,\" LeBlanc told guest-host Karina Roman.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Carney also said his government will focus on strengthening the Canadian economy by expanding trade with other countries, doubling the pace of home-building and making investments in national defence.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Earlier this year, Carney's government saw the passage of legislation that would streamline approvals for nation-building projects such as highways, railways, ports, airports, pipelines, critical minerals, mines, nuclear facilities and electrical transmission projects.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Canadian government will soon select the first in a series of new nation-building projects that will connect and transform our economy,\" he said on Friday.</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;It's time to 'stickhandle' with U.S., Carney says:&nbsp;</strong></em></div><p dir=\"ltr\">Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre criticized Carney's decision, accusing the prime minister of making \"generous concessions\" to the U.S. president without getting anything in return.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Today we learned that it is yet another capitulation and climb-down by Mark Carney, his elbows have mysteriously gone missing,\" he said Friday.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Poilievre says either Carney has to admit that he was wrong all along or that he lied during the election campaign when he said he was the man who could get the&nbsp;best deal with Trump.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"He needs to explain which of those two things it is,\" Poilievre said.&nbsp;</p><div dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>WATCH | Poilievre slams Carney's negotiating skills:&nbsp;</em></strong></div><p dir=\"ltr\">The Conservative leader went on to say that his objective is to have all tariffs between Canada and the U.S. removed and he would have demanded that from Trump if he was prime minister.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"I would have gone to the president, respectfully, and said: 'You remove your tariffs, we remove ours. Let's sign an agreement that restores the great free-trading relationship that our two countries had for decades,'\" he said.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Unifor&nbsp;and Canadian Federation of Independent Business weigh in</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he spoke with Carney after the announcement, telling him Canada needs an agreement with the U.S. that provides relief to the steel, auto, forestry and copper industries.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"If the federal government can't achieve that, they need to hit back hard against U.S. tariffs and provide additional supports for the workers and businesses in these sectors,\" Ford said in a statement.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) welcomed Carney's announcement in a statement, calling it a \"step in the right direction\" that will \"take the pressure off Canadian small businesses.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Many small business owners have told us that Canada's retaliatory measures were almost as damaging as the U.S. tariffs themselves,\" the CFIB's Corinne Pohlmann said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Pohlmann said that while the announcement provides some relief, Canadian companies have already paid millions of dollars in tariffs, and she urged the federal government to provide some of that revenue to small businesses impacted by the trade war.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a statement posted on X, Lana Payne, the president of Unifor, the largest private sector union in Canada with more than 300,000 members, said Carney's move was a mistake.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Walking back counter-tariffs isn't an olive branch.
