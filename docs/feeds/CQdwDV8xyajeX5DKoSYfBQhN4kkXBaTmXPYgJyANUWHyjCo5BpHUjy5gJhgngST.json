While this is plenty impressive by itself, the developers go on to reveal that, out of that million, 78% of the downloads came from a Windows machine. That means that at least 780,000 people on Windows gave Zorin OS 18 a download... \n\n[I]t's easy to see why: the developers put a heavy emphasis on making their system the perfect home for ex-Windows users.\n","contentLength":907,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Red Hat Losing Another Prominent Linux Kernel Engineer","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/11/18/2229244/red-hat-losing-another-prominent-linux-kernel-engineer?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1763509200,"author":"BeauHD","guid":211,"unread":true,"content":"Another highly influential Linux kernel engineer, David Hildenbrand, is leaving Red Hat after a decade of major contributions to memory management, virtualization, and VirtIO.

But Valve's Windows-to-Linux compatibility layer generally only extends back to games written for Direct3D 8, the proprietary Windows graphics API Microsoft released in late 2000. Now, a new open source project is seeking to extend Linux interoperability further back into PC gaming history. The d7vk project describes itself as \"a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7 [D3D7], which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine.\"\n \nThe new project isn't the first attempt to get Direct3D 7 games running on Linux. Wine's own built-in WineD3D compatibility layer has supported D3D7 in some form or another for at least two decades now. But the new d7vk project instead branches off the existing dxvk compatibility layer, which is already used by Valve's Proton for SteamOS and which reportedly offers better performance than WineD3D on many games. D7vk project author WinterSnowfall writes that while they don't expect this new project to be upstreamed into the main dxvk in the future, the new version should have \"the same level of per application/targeted configuration profiles and fixes that you're used to seeing in dxvk proper.\" And though d7vk might not perform universally better than the existing alternatives, WinterSnowfall writes that \"having more options on the table is a good thing in my book at least.\" The report notes that the PC Gaming Wiki lists more than 400 games built on the aging D3D7 APIs, spanning mostly early-2000s releases but with a trickle of new titles still appearing through 2022. Notable classics include Escape from Monkey Island and Hitman: Codename 47.","contentLength":1840,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rust Is Coming To Debian's APT Package Manager","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/11/09/0232234/rust-is-coming-to-debians-apt-package-manager?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762702440,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":207,"unread":true,"content":"A maintainer of Debian's Advanced Package Tool (APT) \"has announced plans to introduce hard Rust dependencies into APT starting May 2026,\" reports the blog It's FOSS.\n\nThe integration targets critical areas like parsing .deb, .ar, and tar files plus HTTP signature verification using Sequoia. [APT maintainer Julian Andres Klode] said these components \"would strongly benefit from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to unit testing.\" \n\nHe also gave a firm message to maintainers of Debian ports: \"If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain, please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or sunset the port.\" \n\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward. Debian wants to move forward with modern tools rather than being held back by legacy architecture... Debian ports running on CPU architectures without Rust compiler support have six months to add proper toolchains. If they can't meet this deadline, those ports will need to be discontinued. As a result, some obscure or legacy platforms may lose official support. For most users on mainstream architectures like x86_64 and ARM, nothing changes. Your APT will simply become more secure and reliable under the hood. \n\nIt's FOSS argues that \"If done right, this could significantly strengthen APT's security and code quality.\" \n\nAnd the blog Linuxiac also supports the move. \"By embedding Rust into APT, the distro joins a growing number of major open-source projects, such as the Linux kernel, Firefox, and systemd, that are gradually adopting Rust. And if I had to guess, I'd say this is just one of the first steps toward even deeper Rust integration in this legendary distribution, which is a good thing.\"","contentLength":1680,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Linux Ported to WebAssembly, Boots in a Browser Tab","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/11/03/0610234/linux-ported-to-webassembly-boots-in-a-browser-tab?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1762173780,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":206,"unread":true,"content":"\"During the past two years or so I have been slow-rolling an effort to port the Linux kernel to WebAssembly,\" reads a surprising post on the Linux kernel mailing list.\n\n\nI'm now at the point where the kernel boots and I can run basic programs from a shell.

The trend has been clear for sometime, and with Windows 10 ending support, it was quite likely this was going to be the time for it to happen as more people try out Linux... \n\nOverall, 3% might not seem like much to some, but again — that trend is very clear and equates to millions of people. The last time Valve officially gave a proper monthly active user count was in 2022, and we know Steam has grown a lot since then, but even going by that original number would put monthly active Linux users at well over 4 million. \n\n\nAdditional details from Phoronix:\n\n\nThe only time Steam on Linux use was close to the 3% mark was when Steam on Linux initially debuted a decade ago and at that time the overall Steam user-base was much smaller than it is today. Long story short, thanks to the ongoing success of Valve's Steam Deck and other handhelds plus Steam Play (Proton) working out so well, these October numbers are the best yet... a hearty 0.41% increase to Linux... landing its overall marketshare at 3.05%. Windows meanwhile was at 94.84% (falling below 95% for the first time in a while) and macOS at 2.11%. For comparison, in October 2024 Steam on Linux was at 2.00%. \n\nThe Linux-specific data shows SteamOS commanding around 27% of all the Linux installs at large. SteamOS most notably being on the Steam Deck hardware.","contentLength":1505,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16 Becomes First Enterprise Linux With Built-In Agentic AI","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/10/29/2211231/suse-linux-enterprise-server-16-becomes-first-enterprise-linux-with-built-in-agentic-ai?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761785100,"author":"BeauHD","guid":204,"unread":true,"content":"BrianFagioli shares a report from NERDS.xyz: SUSE is making headlines with the release of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 16, the first enterprise Linux distribution to integrate agentic AI directly into the operating system.

This gives organizations the ability to run AI-driven automation without relying on a single ecosystem. With a 16-year lifecycle, reproducible builds, instant rollback capabilities, and post-2038 readiness, SLES 16 also doubles down on long-term reliability and transparency.\n \nFor enterprises, this launch marks a clear step toward embedding intelligence at the infrastructure level. The system can now perform AI-assisted administration via Cockpit or the command line, potentially cutting downtime and operational costs. SUSE's timing might feel late given the AI boom, but its implementation appears deliberate -- balancing innovation with the stability enterprises demand.
