It‚Äôs a simple CLI tool that lets you grab templates straight from GitHub, TopTal, or even your own custom repository, all from the terminal. You can search through templates using a TUI interface, combine multiple ones like mixing Go and CLion, and even save your own locally so you don‚Äôt have to redo them every time. If you‚Äôre always setting up new projects and find yourself dealing with .gitignore files over and over, this just makes life a bit easier, hopefully. If that sounds useful, check it out <a href=\"https://github.com/jasonuc/gignr\">here</a> and give it a try. And if you‚Äôve got ideas to make the TUI better or want to add something cool, feel free to open a PR.
