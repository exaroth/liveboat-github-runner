Whenever there&#39;s an outage due to blocking in PostgreSQL, it may give you essential observability.</p> <p>Recently, I experienced a prod outage caused by a blocked migration.</p> <p>The migration itself was almost instantaneous, but it picks up a lock before it actually runs. That may take a while, but that&#39;s no problem, right? The migration runs a bit later, no worries.</p> <p>That&#39;s when I learned that an ALTER TABLE waiting on a lock, itself also blocks benign work that would otherwise run concurrently. So having your blocked ALTER TABLE can spiral into an application-wide outage quite easily.</p> <p>For example, a SELECT WITH UPDATE can run simultaneously with a SELECT, but not if an ALTER TABLE is executed in between. This is to prevent livelocks. A simple solution is to set a lock_timeout in your migrations, which causes the ALTER to fail early and allow all other work to continue. Then, retry the migration later.</p> <p>I figured this out during the post-mortem analysis, but during the outage, this was hard to infer, even from PostgreSQL&#39;s own slow query log. There&#39;s a number of resources on how to discover this during an outage, but afterwards, all that information is gone.</p> <p>Not with pglocklogger. It inspects PostgreSQL&#39;s in-memory state (using in-memory tables intended for this) and logs the output when it crosses particular thresholds. In an outage, or during post-mortem investigations, this may turn out to be an essential observability tool.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sgielen\"> /u/sgielen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/skybitsnl/pglocklogger\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hpni4e/pglocklogger_realtime_log_of_blocked_processes_in/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Hidden Costs of Over-Abstracting Your Codebase","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hpjpn0/hidden_costs_of_overabstracting_your_codebase/","date":1735551424,"author":"/u/bitter-cognac","unread":true,"content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bitter-cognac\"> /u/bitter-cognac </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@all.technology.stories/what-are-the-hidden-costs-of-over-abstracting-your-codebase-8b6a8ab0ab2b?source=friends_link&amp;sk=c0e7ce1b41fa5a8cac594a95c73d66dc\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hpjpn0/hidden_costs_of_overabstracting_your_codebase/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Built a terminal-style website","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hp94mb/built_a_terminalstyle_website/","date":1735515171,"author":"/u/fizzner","unread":true,"content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fizzner\"> /u/fizzner </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/micahkepe/term-website\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hp94mb/built_a_terminalstyle_website/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Fish 4.0: The Fish Of Theseus (C++ to Rust rewrite summary)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hp8dhb/fish_40_the_fish_of_theseus_c_to_rust_rewrite/","date":1735513100,"author":"/u/eugay","unread":true,"content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/eugay\"> /u/eugay </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://fishshell.com/blog/rustport/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hp8dhb/fish_40_the_fish_of_theseus_c_to_rust_rewrite/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"[YT-X] Browse YouTube from the terminal; yt-dlp wrapper","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hp5rro/ytx_browse_youtube_from_the_terminal_ytdlp_wrapper/","date":1735506210,"author":"/u/BenX855","unread":true,"content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BenX855\"> /u/BenX855 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/Benexl/yt-x\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hp5rro/ytx_browse_youtube_from_the_terminal_ytdlp_wrapper/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
