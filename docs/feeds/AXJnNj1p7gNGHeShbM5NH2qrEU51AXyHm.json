This is because I often\nfind the man pages hard to navigate to get the information I want.</p><p>Lately I’ve wondering – could the man page  have an amazing cheat sheet\nin it? What might make a man page easier to use?\nI’m still very early in thinking about this but I wanted to write down some quick notes.</p><p>If you’ve read a lot of man pages you’ve probably seen something like this in\nthe : once you’re listing almost the entire alphabet, it’s hard</p><pre><code>ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,]\n\ngrep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlMmnOopqRSsUVvwXxZz]\n</code></pre><p>The <a href=\"https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1\">rsync man page</a>\nhas a solution I’ve never seen before: it keeps its SYNOPSIS very terse, like this:</p><pre><code> Local:\n     rsync [OPTION...] SRC... [DEST]\n</code></pre><p>and then has an “OPTIONS SUMMARY” section with a 1-line summary of each option, like this:</p><pre><code>--verbose, -v            increase verbosity\n--info=FLAGS             fine-grained informational verbosity\n--debug=FLAGS            fine-grained debug verbosity\n--stderr=e|a|c           change stderr output mode (default: errors)\n--quiet, -q              suppress non-error messages\n--no-motd                suppress daemon-mode MOTD\n</code></pre><p>Then later there’s the usual OPTIONS section with a full description of each option.</p><h3>an OPTIONS section organized by category</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html\">strace man page</a>\norganizes its options by category (like “General”, “Startup”, “Tracing”, and\n“Filtering”, “Output Format”) instead of alphabetically.</p><p>As an experiment I tried to take the  man page and make an\n“OPTIONS SUMMARY” section grouped by category, you can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jvns/9f5966633875a4758e0d947a5b4dbdcf\">see the results\nhere</a>. I’m not\nsure what I think of the results but it was a fun exercise. When I was writing\nthat I was thinking about how I can never remember the name of the  grep\noption. It always takes me what feels like forever to find it in the man page\nand I was trying to think of what structure would make it easier for me to find.\nMaybe categories?</p><p>A couple of people pointed me to the suite of Perl man pages (, , etc), and one thing I\nnoticed was <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/perlcheat\">man perlcheat</a>, which has\ncheat sheet sections like this:</p><pre><code> SYNTAX\n foreach (LIST) { }     for (a;b;c) { }\n while   (e) { }        until (e)   { }\n if      (e) { } elsif (e) { } else { }\n unless  (e) { } elsif (e) { } else { }\n given   (e) { when (e) {} default {} }\n</code></pre><p>I think this is so cool and it makes me wonder if there are other ways to\nwrite condensed ASCII 80-character-wide cheat sheets for use in man pages.</p><h3>examples are very popular</h3><p>A common comment was something to the effect of “I like any man page that has\nexamples”. Someone mentioned the OpenBSD man pages, and the <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/tail\">openbsd tail</a> man page has examples of\nthe exact 2 ways I use tail at the end.</p><p>I think I’ve most often seen the EXAMPLES section at the\nend of the man page, but some man pages (like the <a href=\"https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.1\">rsync man page</a> from earlier) start with\nthe examples. When I was working on the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add\">git-add</a> and <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase\">git rebase</a>\nman pages I put a short example at the beginning.</p><h3>a table of contents, and links between sections</h3><p>This isn’t a property of the man page itself, but one issue with man pages in\nthe terminal is it’s hard to know what sections the man page has.</p><p>When working on the Git man pages, one thing Marie and I did was to\n<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase\">add a table of contents</a> to the sidebar of\nthe HTML versions of the man pages hosted on the Git site.</p><p>I’d also like to add more hyperlinks to the HTML versions of the Git man pages\nat some point, so that you can click on “INCOMPATIBLE OPTIONS” to get to that\nsection. It’s very easy to add links like this in the Git project since Git’s\nman pages are generated with AsciiDoc.</p><p>I think adding a table of contents and adding internal hyperlinks is kind of a\nnice middle ground where we can make some improvements to the man page format\n(in the HTML version of the man page at least) without maintaining a totally\ndifferent form of documentation. Though for this to work you do need to set up a\ntoolchain like Git’s AsciiDoc system.</p><p>It would be amazing if there were some kind of universal system to make it easy\nto look up a specific option in a man page (“what does -a do?”).\nThe best trick I know is use the man pager to search for something like \nbut I never remember to do it and instead just end up going through\nevery instance of  in the man page until I find what I’m looking for.</p><h3>examples for every option</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html\">curl man page</a> has examples for every\noption, and there’s also a table of contents on the HTML version so you can more\neasily jump to the option you’re interested in.</p><p>For instance the example for  makes it easy to see that you likely also want to pass the  option, like this:</p><pre><code>  curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://example.com\n</code></pre><p>Quite a few people said that <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ascii.7.html\">man ascii</a> was their\nfavourite man page, which looks like this:</p><pre><code> Oct   Dec   Hex   Char                     \n ───────────────────────────────────────────\n 000   0     00    NUL '\\0' (null character)\n 001   1     01    SOH (start of heading)   \n 002   2     02    STX (start of text)      \n 003   3     03    ETX (end of text)        \n 004   4     04    EOT (end of transmission)\n 005   5     05    ENQ (enquiry)            \n 006   6     06    ACK (acknowledge)        \n 007   7     07    BEL '\\a' (bell)          \n 010   8     08    BS  '\\b' (backspace)     \n 011   9     09    HT  '\\t' (horizontal tab)\n 012   10    0A    LF  '\\n' (new line)      \n</code></pre><p>Obviously  is an unusual man page but I think what’s cool about this man page (other than the fact that it’s always\nuseful to have an ASCII reference) is it’s very easy to scan to find the\ninformation you need because of the table format. It makes me wonder if there\nare more opportunities to display information in a “table” in a man page to make\nit easier to scan.</p><p>When I talk about man\npages it often comes up that the GNU coreutils man pages\n(for example <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html\">man tail</a>)\ndon’t have examples, unlike the OpenBSD man pages, which <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/tail\">do have examples</a>.</p><p>I’m not going to get into this too much because it seems like a fairly political\ntopic and I definitely can’t do it justice here, but here are some things I\nbelieve to be true:</p><ul><li>The GNU project prefers to maintain documentation in “info” manuals instead of man pages. <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html\">This page</a> says “the man pages are no longer being maintained”.</li><li>There are 3 ways to read “info” manuals: their HTML version, in Emacs, or with a standalone  tool. I’ve heard from some Emacs users that they like the Emacs info browser. I don’t think I’ve ever talked to anyone who uses the standalone  tool.</li></ul><p>After a certain level of complexity a man page gets really hard to navigate: while I’ve never used the coreutils info manual and probably won’t, I would almost certainly prefer to use the\n<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html\">GNU Bash reference manual</a> or the <a href=\"https://sourceware.org/glibc/manual/latest/html_mono/libc.html\">The GNU C Library Reference Manual</a> via their HTML documentation rather than through a man page.</p><h3>a few more man-page-adjacent things</h3><p>Here are some tools I think are interesting:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://tldr.sh\">tldr.sh</a> is a community maintained database of examples, for example you can run it as . Lots of people have told me they find it useful.</li><li>the <a href=\"https://kapeli.com/dash\">Dash</a> Mac docs browser has a nice man page viewer in it. I still use the terminal man page viewer but I like that it includes a table of contents, it looks like this:</li></ul><img src=\"https://jvns.ca/images/dash.webp\"><p>Man pages are such a constrained format and it’s fun to think about what you can\ndo with such limited formatting options.</p><p>Even though I’m very into writing I’ve always had a bad habit of never reading\ndocumentation and so it’s a little bit hard for me to think about what I\nactually find useful in man pages, I’m not sure whether I think most of the\nthings in this post would improve my experience or not. (Except for examples, I\nLOVE examples)</p><p>So I’d be interested to hear about other man pages that you think are well\ndesigned and what you like about them,\nthe <a href=\"https://comments.jvns.ca/post/116093529820975727\">comments section is here</a>.</p>","contentLength":7987,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev"]}
