I&#39;m ready to explore other options. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a master at Linux. But I know my way around and I am able to get things working if I have to. </p> <p>However I want to know what others are using. Why they like it. What they hate about it and why it would be a good move.</p> <p>I&#39;ve lived with xfce all these years. I do game. But I also do some image editing as well as video creation/editing. I&#39;ve lived and vm tested mint, peppermint, Ubuntu, pop, and Manjaro. They all just seem the same. So I thought I would get a better idea of what is out there and how other use them. Let me know what you like and why.
