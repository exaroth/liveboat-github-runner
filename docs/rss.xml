"However, like any flourishing ecosystem, it also attracts its share of bad actors... That's why every year, we continue to invest in more ways to protect our community." Google's tactics include industry-wide alliances, stronger privacy policies, and "AI-powered threat detection." 

"As a result, we prevented 2.36 million policy-violating apps from being published on Google Play and banned more than 158,000 bad developer accounts that attempted to publish harmful apps. "

To keep out bad actors, we have always used a combination of human security experts and the latest threat-detection technology. In 2024, we used Google's advanced AI to improve our systems' ability to proactively identify malware, enabling us to detect and block bad apps more effectively. It also helps us streamline review processes for developers with a proven track record of policy compliance. Today, over 92% of our human reviews for harmful apps are AI-assisted, allowing us to take quicker and more accurate action to help prevent harmful apps from becoming available on Google Play. That's enabled us to stop more bad apps than ever from reaching users through the Play Store, protecting users from harmful or malicious apps before they can cause any damage. 

Starting in 2024 Google also "required apps to be more transparent about how they handle user information by launching new developer requirements and a new 'Data deletion' option for apps that support user accounts and data collection.... We're also constantly working to improve the safety of apps on Play at scale, such as with the Google Play SDK Index. This tool offers insights and data to help developers make more informed decisions about the safety of an SDK." 

And once an app is installed, "Google Play Protect, Android's built-in security protection, helps to shield their Android device by continuously scanning for malicious app behavior."
 Google Play Protect automatically scans every app on Android devices with Google Play Services, no matter the download source. This built-in protection, enabled by default, provides crucial security against malware and unwanted software. Google Play Protect scans more than 200 billion apps daily and performs real-time scanning at the code-level on novel apps to combat emerging and hidden threats, like polymorphic malware. In 2024, Google Play Protect's real-time scanning identified more than 13 million new malicious apps from outside Google Play [based on Google Play Protect 2024 internal data]... 

According to our research, more than 95 percent of app installations from major malware families that exploit sensitive permissions highly correlated to financial fraud came from Internet-sideloading sources like web browsers, messaging apps, or file managers. To help users stay protected when browsing the web, Chrome will now display a reminder notification to re-enable Google Play Protect if it has been turned off... Scammers may manipulate users into disabling Play Protect during calls to download malicious Internet-sideloaded apps. To prevent this, the Play Protect app scanning toggle is now temporarily disabled during phone or video calls... 

Google Play Protect's enhanced fraud protection pilot analyzes and automatically blocks the installation of apps that may use sensitive permissions frequently abused for financial fraud when the user attempts to install the app from an Internet-sideloading source (web browsers, messaging apps, or file managers). Building on the success of our initial pilot in partnership with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), additional enhanced fraud protection pilots are now active in nine regions — Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Philippines, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. 

In 2024, Google Play Protect's enhanced fraud protection pilots have shielded 10 million devices from over 36 million risky installation attempts, encompassing over 200,000 unique apps.

           By January 30, 2025
           
While the path toward the ability to write device drivers in Rust has been
anything but smooth, steady progress has been made and that goal is close
to being achieved — for some types of drivers at least.  Device drivers
need to be able to set up memory areas for direct memory access (DMA)
transfers, though; that means Rust drivers will need a set of
abstractions to interface with the kernel's DMA-mapping subsystem.  Those
abstractions have run into resistance that has the potential to block
progress on the Rust-for-Linux project as a whole.

DMA transfers move data directly between RAM and the device of interest,
without involving the CPU.  It is difficult to get any sort of reasonable
I/O performance without DMA, so almost all devices support it.  Making DMA
work, though, is not just a matter of handing a memory address to a
peripheral device; there are many concerns that must be dealt with.  These
include maintaining cache coherency, ensuring that pages are resident in
RAM, handling device-specific addressing limitations, programming I/O
memory-management units, and more.  Plus, of course, every architecture
does things differently.  The DMA-mapping layer exists to hide most of
these problems from device drivers behind an architecture-independent
interface.

Drivers written in Rust will need to do DMA, so they will need access to
the mapping layer.  There have been patches to provide some of that access
in circulation for some time; Abdiel Janulgue posted a version
of this work in early January.  This series adds a small Rust module
with sufficient support to set up coherent mappings (long-term mappings in
cache-coherent memory) for drivers.  This work only covers part of the DMA
API, but it is sufficient for simpler devices.  Upcoming drivers will
require that these abstractions are in place.

But Christoph Hellwig, who does a lot of work with the DMA-mapping layer,
turned this submission
away with a message reading, in its entirety: "No rust code in
kernel/dma, please" (despite the fact that the patch did not put any
code in that directory).  When pressed, he added that developers
should keep these abstractions in their own code and said that he had no
interest in maintaining multi-language code.  Rust developers should keep
their wrapping code to themselves, he concluded.

Danilo Krummrich pointed out
that the proposed abstractions were doing exactly that — keeping the Rust
code separate from the rest: "We wrote a single piece of Rust code that
abstracts the C API for all Rust drivers, which we offer to maintain
ourselves".  The conversation then went quiet for several days, after
which Krummrich said:
"Since there hasn't been a reply so far, I assume that we're good with
maintaining the DMA Rust abstractions separately".

Hellwig, though, made it
clear that he is not on board with that plan.  He does not want the
Rust code anywhere near the DMA layer, and that fact that somebody else
would be maintaining it does not change his view.  Adding another language
(he was clear that he was talking about any language, not Rust in
particular) would, he said, make Linux as a whole "".  That has, for now, brought the conversation to a halt.

Without DMA support, there can be no interesting drivers written in Rust.
So one option that the Rust-for-Linux developers have at this point is to
give up on the whole thing and find a less frustrating project to work on.
As appealing as this option might be, it still is probably not their
first choice, though.

An alternative would be to do what Hellwig is suggesting and put the
abstractions into each driver that needs them.  That, however, is not a
path toward a more maintainable kernel.  When the DMA API changes, as it
inevitably will, numerous drivers will have to be fixed, one by one, rather
than fixing a single set of abstractions that are used by all.  So this,
too, might not appear at the top of the list of options as seen by the
developers involved.

Yet another approach might be to stash the DMA abstractions somewhere out
of Hellwig's immediate sight — not in the  directory, in
other words.  At that point it becomes just another user of the DMA API
that, in theory, is not subject to more scrutiny than any other driver.
The only problem with this idea is that Janulgue's patch already does that,
and it was not sufficient.

Someday, there will need to be a more decisive answer to this
question.  Krummrich has tried to bring this about with a note asking for Linus Torvalds
or Greg Kroah-Hartman to make a decision regarding these abstractions.
Other Rust developers have reiterated
that they would take responsibility for the maintenance of this code, and
that it would not affect the DMA subsystem.  Jason Gunthorpe questioned that last
claim, noting that a 6.14 pull request was delayed due to a Rust build
problem, but Kroah-Hartman answered that it was
"a tooling issue that people missed due to the holidays" rather than
an example of Rust code holding up development.  Neither he nor Torvalds
has made any decrees on whether the code in question will be merged, though.


By allowing the entry of Rust, the kernel community has decided
— on a provisional basis, at least — that it is indeed willing to maintain
a multi-language code base.  Perhaps, for now, the desire to banish Rust
code to the periphery of the kernel makes some sense, while Rust is still
seen as an ongoing experiment.  If it is eventually decided that the Rust
experiment has failed, backing the existing Rust code out will be easier if
it's confined to the edges.

But it seems increasingly unlikely that the Rust experiment will be judged
that way.  Rust clearly can be used to write kernel code, and there would
appear to be some significant advantages to doing that.  If the experiment
has indeed succeeded then, at some point, the language will need to be
treated as a first-class citizen within the kernel.  Over time, "I don't
want to deal with more than one language" will be an increasingly weak
argument against a contribution written in Rust.

That day may be a while in coming yet.  Already overworked kernel
maintainers will have to find time to learn Rust well enough to manage it
within their subsystems.  Incoming Rust developers can shoulder some of
that burden, but they too will need time to acquire anywhere near the level of
experience that the current maintainers have — experience that the kernel
community depends on heavily.  A change of this magnitude to a body of code
as large as the kernel was never going to be a quick or easy affair; it has
gone as well as could have been expected so far, but there will be more,
perhaps harder, obstacles to overcome in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada to file WTO claim against Trump tariffs, seek redress under regional free trade deal</title><link>https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3297100/canada-file-wto-claim-against-trump-tariffs-seek-redress-under-regional-free-trade-deal?module=top_story&amp;amp;pgtype=homepage</link><author>/u/Saltedline</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 03:03:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ will file a World Trade Organization claim against US President  tariffs and also seek redress under a regional free trade deal, a Canadian official said on Sunday.“The Canadian government clearly considers these tariffs to be a violation of trade commitments that the United States has taken,” the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told a briefing.After weeks of threats, Trump on Saturday signed off on 25 per cent tariffs on all Canadian imports except energy resources, which will be hit with a 10 per cent levy.“We will obviously pursue the legal recourse that we believe we have through the agreements that we share with the United States,” the official said, citing the WTO and US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump himself signed in 2018.A review of the pact, which a Canadian official called a “gold standard agreement”, was expected to be held next year.Ottawa also unveiled on Sunday a list of 1,256 American goods  in a first round of counter tariffs worth C$30 billion (US$20.6 billion) billion starting on Tuesday.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>India expands Aadhaar authentication for businesses, raising privacy concerns</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/india-expands-aadhaar-authentication-for-businesses-raising-privacy-concerns/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 03:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[India has expanded its Aadhaar authentication service to let businesses such as those in e-commerce, hospitality, and healthcare use the biometrics of individuals to authenticate their identity.© 2024 TechCrunch.

I have a meeting coming up with mid-level managers. This meeting has been a long time coming, I've been pushing for it for years and I think I've finally gotten through to at least one of them. Wether he's onboard 100% or not is yet to be seen Short explanation of the situation: we're an old enterprise company, old code, old dependencies, old developers, old managers, and a (mostly) old mindset, except when it comes to security. We have used mainly Perl in the past, but a few devs are starting to use Python more.I'm trying to get them to add Go as a development option.Perl is 🤮 and Python doesn't quite cut it sometimes need shorter processing times types would reduce bugs I see on the reg strict error handling to reduce missed errors current parallel processing is costlyReasons I think they would care:less bugs than other compiled languages faster processing than current languages type safety parallelism baked in dead simple syntax and readability backward compatibility is better than most great community support lower cost and less server loadOne additional problem is that most folks think Go is for web, I've made arguments against that. The top reason is true even for Rust because most of my division isn't computer science and would be unable to understand Rust(I write in Rust too).I need to flesh out some of these arguments and probably could add a few more, can you help me out?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boeing Acquires Spirit AeroSystems, While Boeing&apos;s &apos;Starliner&apos; Unit Gets a New VP</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/03/0148221/boeing-acquires-spirit-aerosystems-while-boeings-starliner-unit-gets-a-new-vp?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 01:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Spirit Aerosystems builds aircraft components, including fuselages and flight deck sections for Boeing, according to Wikipedia. But now Boeing is set to acquire Spirit AeroSystems. 

The aviation blog called Aviation Source News says the price tag was $4.7 billion, and opines that Boeing's move signals "a renewed focus on quality and supply chain stability" as Boeing "addresses lingering concerns surrounding its 737 program."
 Spirit's recent struggles with quality control and production delays have had a fallout effect for Boeing... By integrating Spirit's operations, Boeing can implement more stringent oversight and ensure consistent manufacturing processes. This move is a direct response to past quality lapses that have plagued the company and damaged its reputation. Beyond quality control, the acquisition also offers Boeing greater control over its supply chain. By bringing a key supplier in-house, Boeing can streamline production, improve coordination, and reduce the risk of future disruptions... 

Spirit AeroSystems also supplies parts to Airbus, Boeing's main competitor. To address this, a separate agreement is being negotiated for Airbus to acquire Spirit's Airbus-related business. This strategic move ensures that Airbus maintains control over its own supply chain and prevents Boeing from gaining undue influence over its competitor's production. 

Meanwhile, the vice president leading Boeing's Starliner spacecraft unit "has left his role in the program and been replaced by the company's International Space Station program manager, John Mulholland," Reuters reports, citing a Boeing spokesperson.


In its first test mission last summer flying astronauts, Starliner was forced by NASA to leave its crew aboard the ISS and return empty in September over problems with its propulsion system. A panel of senior NASA officials in August had voted to have a Crew Dragon capsule from Elon Musk's SpaceX bring them back instead, deeming Starliner too risky for the astronauts. 

Paul Hill, a veteran NASA flight director and member of the agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, said during a quarterly panel meeting on Thursday that NASA and Boeing continue to investigate Starliner's propulsion system. A Boeing spokesperson said on Thursday that the company and NASA have not yet determined what Starliner's next mission will look like, such as whether it will need to repeat its crewed flight test before receiving NASA certification for routine flights.

"Live from Tokyo," they'd be livestreaming... something. Their description of the event was just two words. 

"Deep Research" 

UPDATE: The stream has begun, and it's about OpenAI's next "agent-ic offering". ("OpenAI cares about agents because we believe they're going to transform knowlege work...") 
"We're introducing a capability called Deep Research... a model that does multi-step research. It discovers content, it synthesizes content, and it reasons about this content." It even asks "clarifying" questions to your prompt to make sure its multi-step research stays on track. Deep Research will be launching in ChatGPT Pro later today, rolling out into other OpenAI products... 

And OpenAI's site now has an "Introducing Deep Research" page. Its official description? "An agent that uses reasoning to synthesize large amounts of online information and complete multi-step research tasks for you. Available to Pro users today, Plus and Team next."

 

Before the livestream began, X.com users shared their reactions to the coming announcement: 
"It's like DeepSeek, but cleaner"
"Deep do do if things don't work out"
"Live from Tokyo? Hope this research includes the secret to waking up early!"
"Stop trying, we don't trust u" 

But one X.com user had presciently pointed out OpenAI has used the phrase "deep research" before. In July of 2024, Reuters reported on internal documentation (confirmed with "a person familiar with the matter") code-named "Strawberry" which suggested OpenAI was working on "human-like reasoning skills."


How Strawberry works is a tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, the person said. The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company's AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms "deep research," according to the source. This is something that has eluded AI models to date, according to interviews with more than a dozen AI researchers. 

Asked about Strawberry and the details reported in this story, an OpenAI company spokesperson said in a statement: "We want our AI models to see and understand the world more like we do. Continuous research into new AI capabilities is a common practice in the industry, with a shared belief that these systems will improve in reasoning over time." The spokesperson did not directly address questions about Strawberry. 

The Strawberry project was formerly known as Q*, which Reuters reported last year was already seen inside the company as a breakthrough... OpenAI hopes the innovation will improve its AI models' reasoning capabilities dramatically, the person familiar with it said, adding that Strawberry involves a specialized way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets. 

Researchers Reuters interviewed say that reasoning is key to AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence... OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this year that in AI "the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brazil’s Lula says any US tariffs would be reciprocated</title><link>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/30/brazils-lula-says-any-us-tariffs-would-be-reciprocated</link><author>/u/Infidel8</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 23:35:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said that, if the United States imposes tariffs on his country, he will respond in kind.Speaking at a news conference in the capital Brasilia, on Thursday, Lula said his country seeks a relationship based on mutual respect. His comments came in response to US President Donald Trump’s threat of heightened tariffs.“It is very simple: If he taxes Brazilian products, there will be reciprocity,” Lula told reporters.“Trump was elected to run the US, and I was elected to run Brazil. I will respect the US and want Trump to respect Brazil. That’s all.”The comments are the latest signal that Trump’s efforts may spark a trade war with US allies.Lula’s stance also offers a model for how other Latin American countries might respond to Trump’s protectionist policies. Trump has touted tariffs as a mechanism to boost domestic industry, as well as to force international rivals to accede to demands ranging from manufacturing to migration.Earlier this week, Trump threatened large tariffs against Colombia when President Gustavo Petro initially refused to allow a US military flight bearing undocumented immigrants to land.Petro objected to the US treatment of the immigrants, some of whom were reportedly handcuffed.After the two leaders exchanged tariff threats, Petro backed down, allowing future flights to proceed, despite implying a comparison between Trump and “white slavers”.But Trump has proceeded to dangle the prospect of tariffs against other countries since the diplomatic spat.On Thursday, for instance, he told reporters that he planned to make good on a promise to impose 25 percent tariffs on the neighbouring countries of Canada and Mexico, two of the US’s biggest trading partners.“We don’t need the products that they have,” Trump said.Trump has indicated the tariffs would incentivise Mexico and Canada to tighten their border security and stem the flow of drugs, migrants and asylum seekers. In the past, Trump has also threatened to carry out military strikes inside of Mexico to deal with drug-trafficking cartels that move fentanyl over the border.Experts tie the mounting shadow of tariffs to Trump’s stated desire to pursue an “America First” foreign policy, putting US interests above all else.His remarks at his second inauguration on January 20 emphasised that platform. Not only did he tease impending tariffs “to enrich our citizens”, but he also laid out an expansionist vision for the US’s future, including through the seizure of the Panama Canal.Those threats, however, have not been well received in Latin America, where a long history of US interventions and meddling remains resonant.“I have governed Brazil while the US had Republican and Democratic presidents, and our relationship has always been between two sovereign countries,” said Lula, who began his third non-consecutive term in office in 2023 after defeating Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro.The US has a trade deficit with Brazil, from which it buys products such as coffee, oil, steel, aircraft and orange juice.Brazil, meanwhile, largely purchases US goods like energy products, pharmaceutical goods and aircraft parts. According to Brazil’s Foreign Trade Secretariat, the country exported $337bn in goods to the US in 2024, and imported $262.5bn.But experts say trade deficits are not necessarily a sign of an unhealthy economic relationship: They are affected by factors such as consumer demand and currency values.There are also fears that a US-sparked trade war could empower other economic rivals to step in.China, for example, has expanded its economic ties with South America in recent years, becoming the primary trading partner for most countries in the region.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GarminDB</title><link>https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB</link><author>haltcatchfire</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 22:27:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>F-strings for C++26 proposal [pdf]</title><link>https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p3412r0.pdf</link><author>HeliumHydride</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 22:19:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</title><link>https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.6.010309</link><author>westurner</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 22:15:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mozilla Adapts &apos;Fakespot&apos; Into an AI-Detecting Firefox Add-on</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/2156241/mozilla-adapts-fakespot-into-an-ai-detecting-firefox-add-on?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 21:58:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader shared this post from the blog OMG Ubuntu


 Want to find out if the text you're reading online was written by an real human or spat out by a large language model trying to sound like one? Mozilla's Fakespot Deepfake Detector Firefox add-on may help give you an indication. Similar to online AI detector tools, the add-on can analyse text (of 32 words or more) to identify patterns, traits, and tells common in AI generated or manipulated text. 

It uses Mozilla's proprietary ApolloDFT engine and a set of open-source detection models. But unlike some tools, Mozilla's Fakespot Deepfake Detector browser extension is free to use, does not require a signup, nor an app download. "After installing the extension, it is simple to highlight any text online and request an instant analysis. Our Detector will tell you right away if the words are likely to be written by a human or if they show AI patterns," Mozilla says. 

Fakespot, acquired by Mozilla in 2023, is best known for its fake product review detection tool which grades user-submitted reviews left on online shopping sites. Mozilla is now expanding the use of Fakespot's AI tech to cover other kinds of online content. At present, Mozilla's Fakespot Deepfake Detector only works with highlighted text on websites but the company says it image and video analysis is planned for the future. 

The Fakespot web site will also analyze the reviews on any product-listing pages if you paste in its URL.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steam breaks Go runtime</title><link>https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/595138100650327297/</link><author>/u/TopAd8219</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 21:49:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Praise for John Arundels books.</title><link>https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books</link><author>/u/ThatGuyWB03</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 21:44:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rubio tells Panama to reduce Chinese influence in canal area | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1SSIlVKv2c</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/d1SSIlVKv2c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 21:22:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has told Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino to reduce Chinese influence over the Panama Canal.

Walker Orr, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, George Fox University, Newberg, OR, 97132, USA (jorr@georgefox.edu).This study examines the adaptation of the problem-solving studio to computer science education by combining it with pair programming. Pair programming is a software engineering practice in industry, but has seen mixed results in the classroom. Recent research suggests that pair programming has promise and potential to be an effective pedagogical tool, however what constitutes good instructional design and implementation for pair programming in the classroom is not clear. We developed a framework for instructional design for pair programming by adapting the problem-solving studio (PSS), a pedagogy originally from biomedical engineering. PSS involves teams of students solving open-ended problems with real-time feedback given by the instructor. Notably, PSS uses problems of adjustable difficulty to keep students of all levels engaged and functioning within the zone of proximal development. The course structure has three stages, first starting with demonstration, followed by a PSS session, then finishing with a debrief. We studied the combination of PSS and pair programming in a CS1 class over three years. Surveys of the students report a high level of engagement, learning, and motivation.Pair programming is an eXtreme programming (XP) methodology (Beck, 2000) that has seen some use in industry (Hannay et al., 2009). It involves two programmers working together on a single problem and computer with one programmer taking the role of a “driver” and the other in the role of “navigator.” The “driver” operates the keyboard and directly writes the code while the “navigator” observes and asks questions, critiquing and refining the code and its design. The “navigator” is not passive, they watch for bugs and defects, think of alternative designs, and look up related documentation and resources. Though the effectiveness of pair programming is mixed (Hawlitschek et al., 2022; Hannay et al., 2009), in some cases it has been shown to produce higher quality code faster than solo programming (Williams et al., 2000). The intention is that pair programming will help developers working together catch mistakes and defects much faster than on their own.\
For education, pair programming is compelling because it fits into the paradigm of apprenticeship and distributed learning, the idea that “Knowledge is commonly socially constructed, through collaborative efforts toward shared objectives or by dialogues and challenges brought about by differences in persons’ perspectives” (Salomon, 1997). Further, it has been shown to increase student satisfaction, reduce student frustration, improve student’s tendency to persist, and give students a sense of self-efficacy (Williams and Upchurch, 2001). The ICAP framework describes four modes of student engagement and behavior, identifying the interactive mode as producing the highest level of student cognitive engagement. Interactive modes of learning are believed to produce deep, transferable knowledge (Chi and Wylie, 2014). Pair programming fits within ICAP’s definition of interactive learning and hence has the potential to produce robust, transferable, conceptual learning. Recently, Hawlitschek et al. (2022) conducted a literature review arXiv:2311.01693v1 [cs.CY] 3 Nov 2023 and meta-study of pair programming in education concluded that pair programming is important and effective for students, especially beginners, but effective instructional design was missing. Hence pair programming has been shown to have a lot of potential as a teaching methodology but the details of how to implement it correctly in a classroom has yet to be discovered.\
We propose that the solution to effective instructional design for pair programming in the classroom has been found in the Problem Solving Studio (PSS) learning environment (Le Doux and Waller, 2016). PSS was designed to teach biomedical engineering students to solve complex problems without having to resort to rote memorization of procedures and algorithms. Students work in teams of two to solve ill-defined problems in a public space, enabling instructors to provide real-time feedback as they progress. A key feature of PSS is dynamic scaffolding, a targeted adjustment of problem difficulty to keep students challenged but not discouraged. By increasing or decreasing the difficulty on a per-team basis in real-time, as many students as possible can be kept in the zone of proximal development. A lecture-based course will have a difficult time matching the variety of levels that students are at since the same lecture content and delivery are communicated to all the students. There is good evidence that PSS improves students’ conceptual understanding (Le Doux and Waller, 2016).\
PSS and pair programming are a natural fit and the combination of the two match the objectives and pedagogical needs of CS1 courses. For this reason, this study specifically addresses the adaptation of PSS in conjunction with pair programming for CS1 pedagogy. Two key objectives of a CS1 course are to teach algorithmic problem solving skills and a specific programming language. One of the challenges for expert instructors is that both problem solving and language knowledge is so deeply ingrained that it is second-nature to the instructors. Paradoxically, this high level of understanding means instructors often have a difficult time communicating this knowledge since it is taken for granted (Le Doux and Waller, 2016). Further, student ability and background varies significantly in CS1 courses. However, the synthesis of PSS and pair programming addresses these challenges and objectives directly, by giving students a hands-on opportunity to develop problem solving and programming language skills. PSS with the addition of pair programming, teaches algorithmic problem solving through a cognitive apprenticeship environment (Collins et al., 1987). Students learn from each other and are also guided by the instructor or other teaching assistants. Peer learning is helpful since students who are at similar levels of ability have recent experience with similar problems. This means that they are often better at communicating those solutions since they remember the details and particularities of both what they found challenging and how they overcame those obstacles. Pair programming’s ability to give rapid feedback helps students learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language. Further it promotes pair collaboration and problem solving. Pair programming has been shown to help notice programmers solve problems can not handle on their own (Hawlitschek et al., 2022). The combination of PSS and pair programming creates both an apprenticeship and peer learning environment in which students develop both problem solving and programming language skills.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Should We Sing the Praises of Agile, or Bury It?</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/1948240/should-we-sing-the-praises-of-agile-or-bury-it?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 20:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Stakeholders must be included" throughout an agile project "to ensure the evolving deliverables meet their expectations," according to an article this week in Communications of the ACM. 

But long-time Slashdot reader theodp complains it's a "gushing how-to-make-Agile-even-better opinion piece."

Like other pieces by Agile advocates, it's long on accolades for Agile, but short on hard evidence justifying why exactly Agile project management "has emerged as a critical component for firms looking to improve project delivery speed and flexibility" and the use of Agile approaches is being expanded across other departments beyond software development. Indeed, among the three examples of success offered in the piece to "highlight the effectiveness of agile methods in navigating complex stakeholder dynamics and achieving project success" is Atlassian's use of agile practices to market and develop its products, many of which are coincidentally designed to support Agile practices and teams (including Jira). How meta. 

Citing "recent studies," the piece concludes its call for stakeholder engagement by noting that "59% of organizations measure Agile success by customer or user satisfaction." But that is one of those metrics that can create perverse incentives. Empirical studies of user satisfaction and engagement have been published since the 1970's, and sadly one of the cruel lessons learned from them is that the easiest path to having satisfied users is to avoid working on difficult problems. Keep that in mind when you ponder why difficult user stories seem to languish forever in the Kanban and Scrum Board "Ice Box" column, while the "Complete" column is filled with low-hanging fruit. Sometimes success does come easy!

Query statements are processed as per the architecture delineated in subsection (B.), yielding instances of data model classes using data sourced from the APIs of local blockchain nodes.3.1 Integrated Data ModelThe design of the language is predicated on a data model that integrates the principal data structures and attributes of the OPB discussed in Section 2.2. Building on prior work and existing tools addressed in Section 2.2, classes and attributes of the five OPB have been identified, generalized, and incorporated into a unified data model. Figure 1 presents the comprehensive data model as a UML class diagram. Table2 enumerates the main model classes, categorized into four packages to represent the chain, block, account, and transaction concepts of the OPB. The concrete syntax for formulating queries is introduced in subsection 3.2. Statements are articulated in terms of the classes and attributes, specifying the source data using class and attribute names of the data model.\
The concepts of the OPB are shown in the table and data model, encapsulated by the classes of the following packages and classes. Classes of the chain package embody one main network and blockchain for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana, as represented by the classes Chain, Network, and ChainDescriptor of the data model. Additional test networks with their distinct blockchains, such as\
Ropsten and Görli in Ethereum, are represented by the Network and ChainDescriptor classes. In Avalanche, the Network class encompasses one primary network, the first of potentially numerous ’subnets’, with separate ChainDescriptor instances for the three P/X/C blockchains.\
The Block and BlockDescriptor classes represent blocks, with discrete classes Status for the block’s status, ValidationDescriptor for validation via the consensus protocol, and ValidatorDescriptor for the involved validators. Conceptually, blocks across all blockchains are identified by a hash value, supplemented with metadata like timestamps and a height value denoting the block number, assuming no changes to non-final blocks. For instance, in Bitcoin and other blockchains following the original "chain of blocks" concept by Nakamoto [22], a block is linked to its predecessor by a hash value, which is used for validation. This is represented by a Block object with (a) a reference to a BlockDescriptor object, e.g. containing metadata such as the timestamp, (b) a reference to the previous BlockDescriptor object in the linkedBlockDescriptor attribute, and (c) a reference to a ValidationDescriptor object containing the hash value. Regarding non-final blocks in Bitcoin, multiple blocks might be discovered as successors to a given block; however, only one block gets included in the chain, while others are dismissed with an ’orphan’ status. In contrast, Ethereum handles similar cases by retaining one block in the main chain while preserving other blocks at the same level with an ’ommer’ status. Blocks in Proof-of-Work chains are not explicitly finalized, permitting the assignment of ’orphan’ or ’ommer’ status to blocks found in parallel to preceding blocks of the chain. Nonetheless, the likelihood of existing blocks being superseded in this manner diminishes over time, as multiple consecutive parallel blocks with greater cumulative work are required. Explicit block finalization, forestalling the emergence of multiple successors, can be observed in more recent Proof-of-Stake blockchains such as Solana.\
Concerning data structure, blocks are connected to one or more existing blocks via the linkedBlockDescriptor attribute of the Block class. This connection can establish either a series of backward-linked blocks as mentioned for Bitcoin or a graph structure, such as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in the Avalanche C chain. The linkedBlockDescriptor relates to the preceding block or, for DAG structures, to any number of previous vertices linked through directed edges. DAG blockchains are indicated by the dagSupport attribute in the BlockDescriptor class, which is set ’true’ accordingly.\
The representation of blocks further depends on the consensus type. In order to unify the representation for Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake, the ValidationDescriptor class contains generic attributes for storing a hash value, the condition for validation such as the target parameter in Bitcoin and the input, e.g. the Nonce in Bitcoin, as well as attributes for the Proof-of-Stake validation. Here, blocks are proposed, created and verified by attestation involving one or more validators. E.g., a Block in Ethereum is proposed and created by a validator represented as ValidationDescriptor object, and is subsequently verified by attestations. Attestations follow from multiple committees of validators that are represented through the attestationCommittee attribute in ValidationDescriptor, e.g. with multiple multiple addresses and votes. Regarding the creation of blocks, they either contain transactions directly or are grouped into time-based slots and epochs for Proof-of-Stake validation purposes. Upon appending a block, each block or slot undergoes validation, necessitating validators’ involvement. As per the ValidationDescriptor class, the creator of a Bitcoin or Ethereum block validates a linked block using the hashValue attribute. Conversely, for other Proof-of-Stake blockchains, block proposers are recorded in the corresponding attributes with attestations, which refer to the ValidatorDescriptor class. Each instance refers to any number of assigned validators who perform attestations of blocks through the committee mentioned before with votes and signatures. Thereby, for Ethereum and other Proof-of-Stake blockchains, the concepts for multiple groups of validators are represented.\
Accounts, a concept prevalent in Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, are embedded in blocks to store assets, tokens, or data that are used for smart contracts. For a generic representation of accounts, the data model represents each Account object with an AccountDescriptor object containing the address and an indication whether the account represents a smart contract or an externally owned account of an individual. Concerning account-related data such as assets or tokens, it is important to note that data might represent assets or tokens natively, as seen in Cardano or Solana, or indirectly through data stored within an account. Each account is defined by an ID, with the concept of an address being common to all blockchains. Account storage of assets or tokens can refer to any custom asset or token represented by data in general. For tokens, token standards such as Ethereum’s ERC-20 or ERC-1155 are represented by the Token class’s attributes. Data storage utilizes binary large objects or key-value stores, which are employed in hash-based mapping data structures.\
The concepts of transactions in Bitcoin and Cardano are distinctive due to these blockchains’ lack of account structures. Consequently, transactions hold references to unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) from previous transactions. In this model, a UTXO is included alongside the transferred value and a script that outlines locking conditions or holds data. While data inclusion is implied in Bitcoin, Cardano explicitly accommodates data in transactions and its storage associated with an address for smart contract functionality.\
On the other hand, in the case of Ethereum, Solana, and the Avalanche C chain, transactions are stored for the transfer of values, data, assets, or tokens between accounts. In the Avalanche X chain, the transfer of native assets is facilitated through the UTXO model. In the data model, the attributes of Transaction and TransactionDescriptor accommodate transfers between addresses by employing the attributes corresponding to the aforementioned concepts.(1) Felix Härer[0000 −0002 −2768 −2342], Digitalization and Information Systems Group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland (felix.haerer@unifr.ch).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Make Different Blockchains Have a Heart-to-Heart</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-different-blockchains-have-a-heart-to-heart?source=rss</link><author>Interoperability in Software Publication</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:53:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[2.3 Interoperability Between BlockchainsInteroperability is widely acknowledged for transactions spanning multiple blockchains, established in cross-chain swaps and similar concepts practically implemented in so-called ’bridges’. Furthermore, efforts towards standardizing inhomogeneous data have commenced not only for query languages.\
 Swaps are typically initiated via a protocol on an originating blockchain, where tokens or arbitrary data are locked to prevent further transfer at the onset. A reciprocal transaction is then issued on a secondary blockchain to the initiator of the cross-chain swap, meaning another party often compensates for the tokens with a different asset on the second chain. This transaction includes a cryptographic proof with a secret that releases the tokens on the initial chain. Finally, the counterparty retrieves tokens from the originating chain. A wide array of protocols and variants have been developed on this foundational principle [20,25]. For atomic cross-chain swaps [13,30], atomicity is assured for all transfers involved in a cross-chain swap. Practical implementations in bridges, however, may exhibit different properties and assurances, not necessarily providing atomicity or other guarantees for the completion of the exchange. Bridges are primarily utilized for cryptocurrency exchanges; for example, Multichain[11], Portal[12], and others[13] facilitate cross-chain swaps between Ethereum, Avalanche, among others. However, cross-chain swaps and bridges lack standardization and do not provide uniform access or queries.\
 Standardization efforts are underway to tackle the issue of inhomogeneous data, with sparse prior work addressing non-uniform access. For Ethereum, one study [19] explores a conceptual schema derived from the primary data structures of the blockchain. In [5], a query language is proposed for the content of blocks and transactions. This language design leans on SQL syntax and supports concepts such as projection and selection within Ethereum. For data analysis, a framework and its implementation based on Scala have been suggested [2], employing SQL or NoSQL alongside aggregation functions and similar analysis methods.\
Another approach [7] details a data warehouse and ETL process for analyzing Ethereum data using standard SQL with a multi-dimensional data model for attribute dimension queries and data aggregation support. Although this and similar studies might connect to multiple blockchains, they fail to provide homogeneous data access, queries, or simultaneous access to data across multiple blockchains.\
Additional work based on SQL includes [17], a study that uses multiple blockchains to populate a standard MySQL database with the third-party service Google BigQuery. However, the reliance on third-party services as data sources presents another commonly observed issue in previous research, where the validation of blockchain data is either impossible or severely restricted. Other methods comprise public connectors between blockchains, blockchains integrating with others, and hybrid approaches [3].\
Interoperability Limitations in Prior Research. Present solutions face limitations in terms of (L1.) data access not being homogeneous, (L2.) incompatibility of node software functions and APIs not providing standardized queries, (L3.) software not being able to view and access data on one or more blockchains in parallel, and (L4.) missing verifiability of the blockchain data. The current emphasis is placed on cross-chain swaps and isolated data analysis as opposed to data integration. The query language proposed herein seeks to mitigate these restrictions by suggesting an integrated data model for uniform access (L1.), a grammar and concrete syntax for standardized access (L2.), a processing architecture supporting multiple blockchains in individual queries (L3.) as well as operating multiple nodes locally for verifying transactions (L4.).(1) Felix Härer[0000 −0002 −2768 −2342], Digitalization and Information Systems Group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland (felix.haerer@unifr.ch).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Are Open and Permissionless Blockchains?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-are-open-and-permissionless-blockchains?source=rss</link><author>Interoperability in Software Publication</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:53:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The section at hand introduces blockchain fundamentals, discusses open and permissionless blockchains, and existing interoperability approaches.2.1 From Bitcoin to BlockchainsFollowing the posting of the Bitcoin whitepaper and corresponding software in 2008 and 2009, respectively [22,23], the term ’blockchain’ emerged as a general term encapsulating its technical architecture. The primary components: (1) a data structure of blocks, arranged in a backward-linked list or any graph, (2) a peer-to-peer network for data distribution, and (3) a consensus protocol, give rise to innovative properties. These notably include the ability to coordinate and validate all operations without trusted third parties or centralized control, open access to all data and operations, and permissionless access, whereby data and operations are not restricted to specific participants [9,1]. Ethereum and subsequent blockchains have enhanced these capabilities by incorporating smart contracts, acting as quasi Turing-complete programs [28,6]. Beyond payments and currency, smart contracts facilitate e-commerce, sales contracts, timestamping, and attestations, among other applications [16,18,11].2.2 Open and Permissionless BlockchainsThe progressive development and adoption springing from Bitcoin and Ethereum have yielded OPB with diverse characteristics. Table 1 catalogs five renowned OPB in the order of their public node count, highlighting the properties of their data structures, networks, and consensus protocols, as well as features pertinent to smart contracts.\
 The original design of backward-linked blocks in Bitcoin is coupled with additional trees or graphs in most other OPB. Beyond transactional data from blocks, supplementary queries must be performed for nontransactional data or older data that has undergone pruning. For instance, separate tree structures are incorporated for state storage in Ethereum, where balances and smart contract variables can be accessed [19].\
. Well-known OPB networks comprise approximately 1300 to 16000 nodes. With algorithmic operation and validation, an increased node count augments security, such as in mitigating the risks associated with 51% attacks and selfish mining [26,24], which are frequently observed in smaller Proof-of-Work systems, e.g. ’Bitcoin Gold’ [24].\
 Between 2008 and 2022, a shift in the initially created protocols can be observed, veering away from Proof-of-Work towards Proof-ofStake, which introduces several trade-offs. While established blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have prioritized security and decentralization over the years, Cardano [15], Avalanche [21], and Solana [29] demonstrated enhancements in efficiency and scalability. This trend is mirrored in the development of novel consensus protocols based on by Proof-of-Stake [10,8] with higher efficiency, advantages to environmental impact, enhanced security, and potentially higher distribution and scalability. For example, Ethereum realizes Proof-of-Stake through GASPER, a combination of the consensus algorithm Caspar-FFG ("Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget") and LMD-GHOST (Latest Message Driven Greedy\
\
Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree)[7]. Based on Caspar-FFG, blocks are proposed in slots of 12 seconds, part of 6.4-minute epochs of 32 slots, by the staking network nodes. The node proposing a block is randomly chosen while other nodes are organized in randomly formed subnets to carry out validations that are aggregated in attestations. Typically, a block is finalized within two epochs with improvements toward single-slot finality[8]. In the case of chain splits, this design together with the fork choice rule has proven itself in practice, demonstrating improved efficiency, decentralization, and security[9]. Other blockchains focus especially on scalability, e.g. Solana. However, temporary protocol failures can be observed frequently, resulting in non-availability [12].\
 Smart contract features are essential for data queries and software applications. Bitcoin offers a limited scripting language employed for programmable monetary transactions and the scalable lightning overlay network. The advent of general-purpose programming in Ethereum and similar platforms introduces a broader range of capabilities and complexity. Currently, most implementations are written and compiled for the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which is present in Ethereum and Avalanche. On the contrary, Cardano and Solana embrace markedly different paradigms. For instance, Cardano supports functional programming, preventing side effects and implementation errors, thus, possibly enhancing security and safety properties[10].(1) Felix Härer[0000 −0002 −2768 −2342], Digitalization and Information Systems Group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland (felix.haerer@unifr.ch).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Access Data Across Different Blockchains</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-access-data-across-different-blockchains?source=rss</link><author>Interoperability in Software Publication</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:52:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Felix Härer[0000 −0002 −2768 −2342], Digitalization and Information Systems Group, University of Fribourg, Switzerland (felix.haerer@unifr.ch).\
 Open and permissionless blockchains are distributed systems with thousands to tens of thousands of nodes, establishing novel platforms for decentralized applications. When realizing such an application, data might be stored and retrieved from one or more blockchains by distributed network nodes without relying on centralized coordination and trusted third parties. Data access could be provided through a query language such as SQL at the application level, establishing a unified view on application-level data that is verifiably stored. However, when accessing multiple blockchains through their node software and APIs, interoperability cannot be assumed today, resulting in challenges of inhomogeneous data access. In addition, different feature sets and trade-offs exist, e.g., regarding smart contract functionality, availability, distribution, scalability, and security. For increasing interoperability, the paper at hand suggests pursuing the development of a cross-chain query language at the application level. The language abstracts from implementation by providing a standardized syntax, an integrated data model, and a processing architecture for data queries. This research is an extended and updated paper of a prior publication demonstrating the language syntax, data model, and architecture with an evaluation of compatibility against the largest open and permissionless blockchains today.As of June 2023, a variety of openly accessible blockchains exist with a significant number of active participants. When considering blockchains with at least 1000 daily active addresses, an estimation counts 18 blockchains operating as open platforms for smart contracts or cryptocurrency [1]. In principle, these platforms can be used for data storage by any business or personal application without centralized coordination and trusted third parties [4,1]. Permissionless and verifiable storage are based on algorithmic consensus in contrast to databases and related technologies. In particular, the systems consist of distributed network nodes joining and operating the network at will while any node is able to verify transactions in the blockchain data structure. Decentralized applications are enabled in this way, primarily for programmable money and contracts.\
These systems with the components blockchain data, network, and consensus protocol can be considered open and permissionless blockchains (OPB), enabling novel decentralized applications such as programmable money or contracts. Contrary to the distributed systems prevalent in previous decades, well-known OPB now involve the coordinated efforts of thousands to tens of thousands of nodes, forming open and permissionless infrastructures.\
Based on the connectivity of active participants, it is estimated that approximately 16,600 nodes are operating Bitcoin[2], 7,600 are operating Ethereum[3], and 3,000 are operating Cardano[4]. These estimations might not take into account potentially uncounted nodes hidden due to specific configurations, e.g. located behind routers and firewalls. As adoption grows, alongside the increasing number of open and permissionless blockchains, as well as the vast quantities of readily available data, this paper posits the future significance of these platforms for verifiable data storage and execution. Applications interfacing with these platforms encompass various uses, including payments and currency, e-commerce, timestamping, and the attestation of data and web links [18,27,11].\
This research offers an extended and updated study of existing work [14] with the following research problem, objective, and contribution.\
 Software accessing data across open and permissionless blockchains (OPB) today face challenges due to interoperability:Inhomogeneous access to data due to various OPB implementationsDifferent OPB data models and features exist.Different OPB trade-offs exist, notably regarding scalability, security, and decentralization.\
Research Objective and Contribution. The objective of this research is to study the three challenges hindering enhanced interoperability among OPB. The paper contributes a cross-chain query language, established by defining an integrated data model, a grammar and concrete syntax, and a processing architecture. In response to query statements submitted by software applications, data from various blockchain nodes is gathered, integrated into the data model, and processed in accordance with the statements. Considering previously suggested conceptual models and query languages, e.g. [19] and [5], the language design abstracts from implementation of today’s largest OPB. The proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates feasibility and compatibility, but also indicates potential for software to incorporate OPB as integral components of their architecture.\
 Consider a scenario where numerous e-commerce websites participate in shared loyalty programs, issuing reward points for customer purchases. This model is not uncommon among collaboratively operating airlines[5], among other industries. Given a cross-chain query language, business-level applications across different airlines could access data in a standardized way, reuse queries in their software components, view data on multiple blockchains, integrate and migrate among blockchains, or exchange the underlying blockchains. This is especially advantageous for decentralized scenarios where centralized coordination is limited, e.g. in business networks of different companies relying on separate infrastructure and technology stacks, or generally in decentralized applications.\
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out background and related studies. Section 3 discusses OPB, focusing on their properties essential for the derivation of an integrated data model. The data model, a grammar with a derived concrete language syntax, and a processing architecture follow. A demonstration of feasibility for the language is provided in Section 4 with a prototype implementation utilizing multiple OPB. Section 5 draws conclusions and provides an outlook.\

Facebook's heavy-handed censorship of Linux groups and topics was "in error," the social media juggernaut has admitted. Responding to reports earlier this week, sparked by the curious censorship of the eminently wholesome DistroWatch, Facebook contacted PCMag to say that it had made a mistake and that the underlying issue had been rectified. 

"This enforcement was in error and has since been addressed. Discussions of Linux are allowed on our services," said a Meta rep to PCMag. That is the full extent of the statement reproduced by the source... Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has appealed against the Community Standards-triggered ban shortly after it noticed it was in effect (January 19). PCMag received the Facebook admission of error on January 28. The latest statement from DistroWatch, which now prefers posting on Mastodon, indicates that Facebook has lifted the DistroWatch links ban. 


More details from PCMag:

Meta didn't say what caused the crackdown in the first place. But the company has been revamping some of its content moderation and plans to replace its fact-checking methodology with a user-driven Community Notes, similar to X. "We're also going to change how we enforce our policies to reduce the kind of mistakes that account for the vast majority of the censorship on our platforms," the company said earlier this month, in another irony. 
"Up until now, we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations, but this has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn't have been," Meta added in the same post.

\
The first time I heard about  was in the summer of 2018 during a casual conversation with a Russian professor of economics. The price action was around $8k per coin.\
At that time, I was unemployed, looking for a job, and wanted to help my parents and one of their friends improve their financial situation while I improved mine. My parents' friend was an 80-year-old guy with his life savings and investments in one of the region's top  that managed two of his portfolios.\
He managed to save and  since 1955. Still, for some inexplicable reason, his wealth was approximately €350k, which is incredibly low for living in one of the top 5 countries of the European Union and having the most minimalistic lifestyle I have ever seen.So how did decades of traditional saving lead to ? Did Bitcoin change his life?\
This story will walk you through the complexity of  (network)  (coin) using conversational language, comparisons, and examples to explain topics that several professionals with master's or Ph.D. degrees in Economics, Finance, or Computer Science don't understand or aren't interested in understanding.\
This isn't another crypto success story. It's a critical examination of what happens when traditional finance meets digital disruption. Sometimes, the most important lessons come from questioning both sides of the equation.WHAT IS BITCOIN: BEHIND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE "RAT POISON" ARCHITECTUREIs Bitcoin worth it? Is it safe? How could an asset grow by more than 10k times in less than 10 years? If it's too good to be true, it should be a Ponzi or a scam, right?\
 more of  than a , but at some point, both concepts merged since they became interdependent to cover the network's sustainability.First, let's explore the complexity of the Bitcoin network, its characteristics, components, and flaws to know how "safe" it is as an infrastructure.THE BITCOIN NETWORK: WHY DOUBLE-SPENDING CAN DESTROY A DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAINThe network is where everything starts and could potentially end. According to Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper, Bitcoin was created as a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash and a solution to double-spending. A system that would allow payments without relying 100% on a third party which for marketers means  even if this word isn't mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper.\
The  dilemma could also exist in banking or other types of centralized systems but in this environment, it is easily "solved" by implementing TTP (Trusted Third Party) models which are used by entities that facilitate interactions between two parties. The problem here is that these parties have to be fully trusted to act on behalf of their client's interests. The concept of  here also means there is no way to verify if the system is operating in your interests, hence the need to trust it.Is The Banking System Secure?When you use the traditional banking system to send money or make a payment, you're not actually doing it yourself; instead, you're giving an order to your bank to handle it for you. They maintain the ledger and check that you have enough funds to complete the transaction. The issue here is that you depend entirely on them to fulfill this task, which operates within a system that lacks transparency and has a central point of failure susceptible to hacking, corruption, or mismanagement.You should know that banks aren't obligated to disclose hacks publicly. Therefore, while major bank hacks do occur, the specifics are often kept confidential. News reports may emerge about a bank experiencing "IT issues" or "service disruptions," which could be a sign of a cyberattack, but the bank may not confirm the details except for communicating the news to people directly impacted or when the hack is too big to be hidden. Hacks in traditional banking are more common than you think and, in some cases, clients aren't protected by law.\
The problem here is so big that it is expected that by 2025 cybercrime could cost $10.5 trillion. Cyberattacks are particularly devastating because, according to IBM, it takes on average 212 days to detect a breach and 75 extra days to contain it. This means hackers count for approximately more than 9 months to infect computers, servers, and networks.\
The financial sector is the second preferred target of hacks after the healthcare industry. \n Here are some cybercrime numbers: Nearly four out of five (78%) of the 240 largest banking institutions suffered a cyberattack in the past year. A major financial services provider experienced a data breach, exposing the personal identification and passport information of 8 million customers. Data security incidents affecting banking institutions have risen sharply (50%) in 2023, indicating a significant escalation of cybercriminal activity.\
This unveils a silent security problem that is hidden by banks and legacy media and taken in most cases as if it isn’t something serious due to the lack of transparency to report the crime to clients.Where Does Blockchain Security Rely?The initial goal of the Bitcoin network creation was to solve the double-spending problem under a PoW (Proof-of-Work) mechanism and without relying on a third party as in the case of banks or any centralized authority. Double-spending happens when someone tries to spend the same digital asset more than once. In a decentralized blockchain like the Bitcoin network, a series of participants are involved during a transaction to prevent this type of fraud.\
Bitcoin prevents double-spending by combining: A transparent, tamper-proof record of all transactions.Decentralized Verification: Thousands of computers (nodes) ensure every transaction is unique and valid. Miners solve cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions, making them irreversible and secure.Despite the blockchain consensus mechanism to guarantee network security, every blockchain faces vulnerability attacks. These attack strategies come in different forms. The most popular and severe is the 51% attack.A 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group gains control of more than 50% of a blockchain network's mining or computational power. This majority control allows the attacker to disrupt the network's operations and manipulate the blockchain ledger.How Does A 51% Attack Happen?Gaining Majority Control: In Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain networks, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. If an individual or group manages to control over 50% of the network's total computational power (hash rate), they can dominate this process.Potential Actions By The Attacker The attacker can spend the same cryptocurrency units more than once by reversing transactions they made while in control. This is achieved by creating a separate, longer version of the blockchain (a fork) where the attacker's transactions are excluded, effectively invalidating them on the original chain. They can prevent other miners from completing valid blocks, thereby halting transaction confirmations and freezing the network.Preventing New Transactions: The attacker can refuse to include new transactions in blocks, effectively censoring participants.Limitations Of A 51% AttackInability to Alter Historical Blocks: The attacker cannot change transactions confirmed in older blocks, as altering these would require rewriting the entire blockchain history, which is computationally infeasible.No Creation of New Coins: They cannot create new coins out of thin air or alter the total supply of the cryptocurrency.Limited to Recent Transactions: The attack primarily affects recent transactions and the ability to confirm new ones.Consequences Of A 51% Attack Such an attack undermines confidence in the cryptocurrency's reliability and security. The perceived vulnerability can lead to a decline in the cryptocurrency's value. Executing a 51% attack, especially on large networks like Bitcoin, requires immense computational resources and energy, making it economically unfeasible for most attackers.\
In August 2020, the Ethereum Classic blockchain experienced multiple 51% attacks. They occurred due to the low network hash rate, the viable economic costs, the poor mining pool distribution, and the scarce number of members in the dev community. However, they solved the issue approximately 48 hours later and proposed changes to their initial POW mechanism to reduce the possibilities of new attacks.\
Even if a 51% attack didn't end with the Ethereum Classic network, it immediately damaged trust in the network which was reflected in the dev community's growth in the long term.How Realistic Is A 51% Attack On The Bitcoin Network?We must analyze both networks' (Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic) hash rates, economic incentives, and developers' numbers to estimate the chances of a potential attack.Hash Rate Comparison (Network Security)The higher the hash rate is, the more decentralized the network becomes due to better-distributed mining power among miners or mining pools which is reflected in energy consumption. ~825.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) 1,000,000 terahashes per second (TH/s)~825,700,000 terahashes per second (TH/s)** \n ** ~245.73 terahashes per second (TH/s)\
This indicates that Bitcoin's hash rate is about 3M times greater than that of Ethereum Classic.Comparison with Banking Systems and Countries Estimates suggest that the traditional banking system consumes about twice as much energy as the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin's energy consumption is comparable to that of medium-sized countries. For instance, its annual consumption of 175.87 TWh is similar to that of Poland.This means that if a group or entity wants to attack the Bitcoin network, they will have to invest as much as the annual energy consumption of Poland, which is considered a mid-sized energy consumer globally.\
This security comes at a cost - both financial and environmental. Is this trade-off worth it for the average investor? \n High energy costs could be seen as something positive and negative at the same time. It will depend on who you ask. \n  \n According to Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Co-founder, "Bitcoin's security model is revolutionary, but its energy consumption is a legitimate concern." On the other side, Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy CEO, thinks "The cost of securing the network is justified by the value it protects."\
Bitcoin Network Security takeawayBitcoin's security relies on massive computational power: comparable to Poland’s annual energy consumptionTraditional banking hacks are cheaper but potentially more profitableThe network has never been successfully 51% attacked even if minor bugs have been reported and solvedSuccess attack probability: QuestionableEconomic incentive for hackers: Likely negative ROIQuestion: Does mining power (high hash rate) cost represent a form of centralization?\
According to some analysts and some of the most popular criticism, Bitcoin mining could be considered a form of centralization due to its difficulty and cost. However, Bitcoin mining companies are derivating part of their revenue in R&D to make mining activity more cost-efficient. This enables them to find cheaper energy sources and at the same time set partnerships with communities around the globe.\
These are some examples: A Bitcoin mining company called  is working with local hydroelectric plants to monetize excess energy capacity, helping to fund rural electrification projects. The state has become a hub for Bitcoin mining using excess natural gas that would otherwise be flared, reducing methane emissions while creating value.\
Last year, I wrote an article that was a review of a YouTube video where I debunked James Jani's point of view about Bitcoin. To explain the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network I explained how  thanks to the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), mining companies, and countries like Paraguay which are working together to make mining more sustainable even if they are still facing some environmental and social issues.\
Additionally, Bitcoin mining companies are currently exploring operations on AI activities which sets a positive challenge to the industry since they are diversifying energy usage. This may lower their participation in the hash rate growth reducing competitive pressure on the Bitcoin network but at the same time giving opportunities to new companies to participate in Bitcoin mining activities.Economic Incentives and Attack FeasibilityThe cost of controlling 51% mining power becomes more expensive.Estimated 51% Attack Cost for 1 Hour (in Blockchain Networks) ~$1.3 million per hour ~$4,200 per hour\
As I mentioned before, the 51% attack in the Ethereum Classic network was solved in approximately 48 hours which is a fast reaction time if we compare it to the banking system that typically needs several months to solve the hack.\
In 2016, the Central Bank of Bangladesh was targeted to exploit vulnerabilities in the SWIFT payment system. The attackers attempted to fraudulently transfer nearly $1 billion from the bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While most transactions were blocked, approximately $101 million was successfully transferred, with about $63-$81 million remaining unrecovered (direct losses).\
The hackers' investment to attack the Central Bank of Bangladesh oscillated around $50k. However, it took the Central Bank of Bangladesh 48 hours to detect the attack, meaning the attackers had spent around $1k per hour to execute the hack.Central Bank of Bangladesh (2016 SWIFT attack) estimated hack investmentThe hack was detected after 48 hoursEstimated total investment by the hacker(s): $50kThis is an estimation since the Central Bank of Bangladesh never disclosed the potential investment attackers could have made to hack the system. The hack cost estimation includes exploitation of SWIFT System vulnerabilities, phishing or social engineering tactics, insider collaboration (if any), and infrastructure and operational costs.When an attack happens they are in partial charge of the system defense since they should build security measures to stop the attack using technical and hardware resources to defend the network.The Bitcoin Core project had around 40-50 regular core developers who frequently contributed code.The broader Bitcoin ecosystem (including Lightning Network, wallets, and other Bitcoin-related projects) had several hundred active developers.Electric Capital's Developer Report from 2023 indicated that Bitcoin had approximately 900-1,000 monthly active developers across all Bitcoin-related projects. \n The development activity was significantly smaller compared to Bitcoin.ETC had around 10-15 core developers working on the main client implementations.The total ecosystem had roughly 50-100 active developers across all ETC-related projects.51% Attack And Other Types Of Vulnerabilities In The Bitcoin NetworkThe 51% attack isn't the only potential vulnerability the Bitcoin network has. There are other types of minor attacks the network has gone through or could potentially experience.|  |  |  |  |

This time we aren't going through the specifics of each vulnerability because this section of the article is a technical overview that aims to help you understand Bitcoin from a technological perspective and measure the potential risks of Bitcoin as an investment.\
However, it was important to examine the 51% attack since it is the most severe and real example of an attack registered until today.\
The other hypothetical big threat to any blockchain network and cryptographic system is quantum computing. However, according to Vitalik Buterin, quantum computing cannot break all forms of cryptographic algorithms. He has added that developers have been working on unbreakable cryptographic algorithm replacements for those that quantum computing can break.\
The topic has been in the study of different groups like QBT, IDQ, BTQ, and others committed to quantum blockchain technologies. Bitcoin Optech, a non-profit research company that aims to help Bitcoin-based businesses, has published some  articles on the topic since 2018.\
While we've explored Bitcoin's technological foundation and security mechanisms in detail, this is only half the story. The network's non-perfect but robust architecture laid the groundwork for Bitcoin's emergence as a unique financial asset – one that would challenge traditional investment paradigms and catch the attention of both institutional and retail investors worldwide as it did with me and my friend who struggled to understand it but highlighted its transparency and resilience in comparison to the one of the banking system.We've dissected Bitcoin's technological foundation but it is still too soon to know if a robust technology automatically makes for a good investment.\
In Part 2, we'll confront the uncomfortable truths about Bitcoin as an investment:How an average traditional portfolio could perform against BitcoinThe real impact of market manipulation on small investorsWhy institutional adoption might not be what you thinkThe hidden costs of "being your own bank"\
Stay tuned as we challenge both the critics and supporters of Bitcoin investment. After all, sometimes the most valuable insights come from questioning our own assumptions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Okta Bcrypt incident can teach us about designing better APIs</title><link>https://n0rdy.foo/posts/20250121/okta-bcrypt-lessons-for-better-apis/</link><author>/u/_n0rdy_</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:15:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello there! If you follow tech news, you might have heard about the Okta security incident that was reported on 1st of November. The TLDR of the incident was this:The Bcrypt algorithm was used to generate the cache key where we hash a  combined string of userId + username + password. Under a specific set of conditions, listed below, this could allow users to authenticate by  providing the username with the stored cache key of a previous  successful authentication.This means that if the user had a username above 52 chars, any password would suffice to log in. Also, if the username is, let’s say, 50 chars long, it means that the bad actor needs to guess only 3 first chars to get in, which is quite a trivial task for the computers these days. Too bad, isn’t it?On the other hand, such long usernames are not very usual, which I agree with. However, some companies like using the entire name of the employee as the email address. So, let’s say, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, a headmaster of Hogwarts, should be concerned, as  is 55 chars. Ooops!This was possible due to the nature of Bcrypt hashing algorithm that has a maximum supported input length of 72 characters (read more here), so in Okta case the characters above the limit were ignored while computing the hash, and therefore, not used in the comparison operation. We can reverse engineer that: - user id with separators if anythis way, the password will be outside the 72 chars limit, and, therefore, ignored by the Bcrypt algorithmHowever, there was one thing that made me wonder: if there is a known limit of the algorithm, why is it not enforced by the crypto libraries as a form of input validation? A simple if input length > 72 -> return error will do the trick. I assumed that they might have used some custom library for Bcrypt implementation and simply forgotten about the input validation, which can happen. So, I decided to check how other programming languages behave.Let’s start with Go, and implement the Okta incident-like case with the help of the official golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt library:All the code samples can be found heregenerates 18-chars long userIdgenerates 55-chars long usernameconcatenates them with each other and a dummy password super-duper-secure-password with the use of  as a separatorcomputes Bcrypt hash from the concatenated stringthen concatenates the same userId and username with a different password uses bcrypt API to compare whether the 2nd concatenated string matches the hash of the 1st oneLet’s run the code and see the result:Good job, Go! If we check the source code of the bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword(...) function, we’ll see this piece of code at the very beginning:Perfect! At this point, I became even more suspicious about the tool Okta used, as it seemed like the industry figured that out based on this example. Spoiler alert: it’s not that simple.Btw, if you like my blog and don’t want to miss out on new posts, consider subscribing to my newsletter here. You’ll receive an email once I publish a new post.Java doesn’t support Bcrypt from its core API, but my simple Google search showed that Spring Security library has implemented it. For those who are not into Java ecosystem, Spring is the most used and battle-tested frameworks out there, that has libraries for almost anything: Web, DBs, Cloud, Security, AI, etc. Pretty powerful tool, that I’ve used a lot in the past, and still sometimes use for my side projects.So, I added the latest version of Spring Security to the project and reproduced the same scenario, as in Go example above:I ran the code, and to my great surprise, saw this outcome:I took a peak at the implementation code, and was disappointed: even though there are a bunch of checks on salt:if (saltLength < 28) {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid salt");
}
...
if (salt.charAt(0) != '$' || salt.charAt(1) != '2') {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid salt version");
}
...
minor = salt.charAt(2);
if ((minor != 'a' && minor != 'x' && minor != 'y' && minor != 'b') || salt.charAt(3) != '$') {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid salt revision");
}
...
I didn’t see any validation of the input that will be hashed. Hm…I decided to check other Google results, and the next Java library in the list was  from Patrick Favre (link to GitHub repo) with 513 starts and the last release version 0.10.2 (so, not stable) from 12th of February 2023 (almost 2 years old). This suggested that I’d not use it in production, but why not to run our tests.Bcrypt from Patrick FavreNice, good job, Patrick, you saved the day for Java!After checking the source code, I found this piece:and the strict strategy that threw the exception we’ve seen:We can see that this strict strategy is used as a part of the default configs:Let’s switch to JavaScript.Here I used the bcryptjs which has over 2 million weekly downloads based on the NPM stats.Not great. The source code reveals that similar to Spring Security, the library validates the saltbut not the input length.Let’s try if Python can do any better.Using bcrypt library with 1.3k starts and the latest release in November.The result is same as we observed for most of our test subjects:All right, but what about some newer and more safety-oriented language - let’s try Rust.Here I need to be honest: since I’m not a Rust expert at all, I used a help of a Claude AI to write this code. So, if you see any issues there, please, let me know in the comments section, so I can fix that.As a library, I used rust-bcrypt based on my AI friend advice.I can see the validation of the cost:but not of the input. And here is the place where the explicit truncation of 72 chars happens (the comment is from the library source code):That was my first question after seeing that the majority of the tools follow the pattern that leads to the vulnerability. Wikipedia article about Bcrypt gave a hint:Many implementations of bcrypt truncate the password to the first 72 bytes, following the OpenBSD implementationInteresting! Let’s check the OpenBSD implementation of this algorithm, and here is the link to it. The first point of interest lies here:And from that moment on,  is used as a limit to iterate over the input string within, for example:Where  is passed as a  parameter. So this piece of code:will make sure that no chars over the limit (72) will end up being processed.Git blame shows that the  line is 11 years oldwhile the if (j >= databytes) j = 0; is 28 years old (what were you busy with in 1997, ah?)So, it’s been a while since the API has been reiterated.Let me start with a short disclaimer: I have a huge respect for people who spend their free time and mental capacity on maintaining open-source projects. That’s a large amount of work, that is not paid, and, unfortunately, quite often not appreciated by the users of the tools. That’s why they have all the legal and ethical rights to build the project the way they see them. My opinions below are not targeted towards anyone in particular.My initial goal was to create issues for each of the mentioned library, but I noticed that this behavior has been already reported to each of them:Check the discussions and their outcomes by following those links.As a guy who spent a few years of my career on building tools and solutions to be used by other software engineers, I understand the frustration: you invested your time and effort into writing a clear documentation and guides, but a certain number of your users don’t bother checking it at all, and just use the tool the way they think it should be used. However, that’s the reality that I had to accept and started thinking about how can I make my tools handle those use cases. Here are a few principles I came up with in that process.Don’t let the people use your API incorrectlyIn my opinion, from the API perspective, the approach when the tool silently cuts the part of the input and processes the remaining one only, it is an extremely poor design choice. What makes things worse is the fact that Bcrypt is used in the domain of security and sensitive data, and, as we can see, most of the tools mentioned above, use  as the name of the input parameter of the hashing method. The good design should explicitly reject the invalid input with the error / exception / any other mechanism the platform uses. So, basically, exactly what Go and Patrick’s Java library did. This way, incidents like Okta one would be impossible by design (btw, I’m not shifting the blame away from Okta, considering the domain they operate in).It is ok, though, to offer the non-default unsafe option, that will let the users pass longer input that will be truncated if the user explicitly asks for that. A prefix/suffix like , , etc. can be a good addition to the names of the method that expose these options.If we take a step back from the Bcrypt case, imagine other examples, if such a pattern becomes common in the industry:We created a new user account on HBO to watch a new season of Rick and Morty, and there is a warning that the max size of the password should not exceed 18 chars. However, the password generator of your password manager tool uses 25 chars as a default length of the produced password. So, the password manager inserts that password while creating an account, but the server cuts the last 7 chars, hashes the rest, and saves the hash to the DB. How easy would it be for us to be able to log in to HBO next time and watch a new episode?The tech lead of the new project configured a linter tool, and set the max line length as 100 chars. While performing a check, linter removes the chars above the defined limit, and informs that the check has passed. How useful would it be?A good API design should remember that when it comes to tech, nobody likes surprises.While following a few online discussions about the Bcrypt Okta incident, I noticed something else: while the majority of comments agreed that we should design APIs like these better, there were a few folks that took a very defensive stance and exposed their ego: “Read a paper before using anything!”, “APIs are only correcting the input after the stupid users!”, etc. Based on my experience, ego is a big enemy of engineering. And I wouldn’t be surprised if you have a story or two in that regard as well. So, yeah, let’s not bring our egos to our APIs.Don’t get me wrong, I do understand the gist that the users should have some basic knowledge before using any tool. But let’s get back to the reality: how many different tools, programming languages, databases, protocols, frameworks, libraries, algorithms, data structures, clouds, AI models, etc. does a software engineer use per week these days? I tried to count for my use case, but stopped after the number had reached 30. Is it possible to know all of them deep? To know all the edge cases and limits? For some of them and to some degree is a reasonable ask, as well as having an expertise in 1 or 2, but definitely not all. The hard truth is that on average, the industry today requires the wide spectrum of knowledge over the deep one (check any job opening to verify that claim). Therefore, while designing the tools, why not to help our fellow colleagues? For example, if our tool accepts only positive numbers, let’s add if num < 1 -> return error  to our solution, and make the life simpler for somebody out there.Especially, if the tool might be used in the security-sensitive context, where humans are usually the weak point in the thread modelling. The good API can help there.It’s not so often that the API we design is something completely new to the world. Most likely, there are other solutions like ours out there. And the chances are that they’ve been already doing certain things the particular way. However, that doesn’t mean that we need to follow the same path. Kudos to the Go team and Patrick’s Java library for being brave to do things the different way as the industry does in the Bcrypt example. Let’s learn from them.Regardless of the original design choices and intentions, it’s never too late to reiterate on some of them if we see a need or have discovered new information. That’s, actually, a place where a lot of us fail due to different reasons, with some of them listed above.The Okta incident exposed large security issues out there. Our test showed, even 3 months after the incident, the industry is still vulnerable to the same outcome, so the chances are that more to come. However, we, as software engineers, can learn from that, and apply these lessons while designing APIs to make them predictable and easier to use.I hope that was useful, and triggered some thoughts. Thanks a lot for reading my post, and see you in the following ones, there are plenty of topics to discuss.

A wide range of treatments share credit: surgery, medicines, radiation, genetic therapies and healthful habits. Mortality rates for those two diseases, the top causes of death in the United States, have fallen sharply. But in an aging population, Alzheimer’s death rates have gone in the opposite direction.The disease afflicts nearly seven million Americans, about one in every nine people over the age of 65, making it a leading cause of death among older adults. Up to 420,000 adults in the prime of life — including people as young as 30 — suffer from early-onset Alzheimer’s. The annual number of new cases of dementia is expected to double by 2050.Yet despite decades of research, no treatment has been created that arrests Alzheimer’s cognitive deterioration, let alone reverses it. That dismal lack of progress is partly because of the infinite complexity of the human brain, which has posed insurmountable challenges so far. Scientists, funders and drug companies have struggled to justify billions in costs and careers pursuing dead-end paths. But there’s another, sinister, factor at play.Over the past 25 years, Alzheimer’s research has suffered a litany of ostensible fraud and other misconduct by world-famous researchers and obscure scientists alike, all trying to ascend in a brutally competitive field. During years of investigative reporting, I’ve uncovered many such cases, including several detailed for the first time in my forthcoming book.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Odin Project Helped Me Escape Tutorial Hell and Changed the Way I Learn Code</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-odin-project-helped-me-escape-tutorial-hell-and-changed-the-way-i-learn-code?source=rss</link><author>CodeByBlazej</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
\
I started learning programming exactly a year ago. At first, I didn’t know if coding would be for me, so I decided to ask my friend, who is a programmer, some questions.\
He learned how to code in college and then at university, eventually landing a job.My Early Journey Into ProgrammingWhy did I want to learn how to code in the first place? Well, I am tired of working in different companies doing mostly the same things every day—fixing machines, operating them, making products on various kinds of machines, and so on.\
I have always wanted to start my own business and build my own projects or serve clients. I used to be a real estate agent, and I really enjoyed that kind of work—serving customers and more.Figuring Out Where to BeginAnyway, after asking my friend a couple of questions and comparing them with the skills I already have, we both concluded that learning programming shouldn’t be so difficult for me. The next step was coming up with some resources. He didn’t know much beyond Udemy and bootcamps, but he promised to contact another friend who’s also a programmer with much more experience. I said I would also do my own research, and then we’d try to find something great together.\
After about two weeks, we called each other with some results. It looked like bootcamps were overpriced, and we thought that most of them were more about taking money from participants rather than truly teaching them how to program. Moreover, many of them tried to teach as fast as possible and seemed focused on keeping people accountable. That wasn’t a big deal for me because when I say that I’ll do something, I will do it no matter what.\
I figured I might not be able to pull three hours a day of learning, but I am sure I can do one or two hours a day for a longer period than a bootcamp would last. On top of that, we claimed that for the price of bootcamps, the same knowledge might be found in courses on Udemy. So we stuck to Udemy.I found three teachers who seemed interesting for learning JavaScript with, and my friend also picked three. After some due diligence, I pulled the trigger on this one.\
I was hyped, excited, and ready to start straight away. I bought the course, prepared some notes, and played the first video. As days passed, I could see my progress in understanding JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I knew how functions work, what variables are, and, most importantly, how to start projects and make JS, HTML, and CSS communicate with each other.\
At this point, I told myself it would be a great idea to split my learning time and add some YouTube videos featuring people doing only projects. I found these 3 guys which I learned a ton from. Really recommend them!So much, in fact, that I started doing my own little project until I got to APIs, which I didn’t understand much. So, I went back to spending more of my learning time on Udemy courses again.\
I kept going with that course until it got me to Classes, which I had no clue about. At that moment, it felt like I’d been introduced to plenty of things in coding, but all the lines of code I had written were actually copied from those resources I showed you above.I didn’t see myself using all this stuff to do something on my own, but the course was already on Classes and OOP, which seemed so alien to me. I felt like I should have known much more at this point in order to grasp all these concepts, yet I wasn’t even told to do anything on my own yet! I knew something was off.\
I checked where I was in this Udemy course, and it turned out I was exactly in the middle. I thought, “Eeeeemmmm, nope! It’s not going to work like that. There is no f***ing way to learn programming (a thing that people spend years on) in like three months.” By my calculation, I would be somewhere near the end of the course around that time. It made me a little sad, and I felt like I might join the group of people who write those types of comments online\
\
I thought there must be a better way.Discovering “Tutorial Hell” and The Odin ProjectI began to scroll Reddit, looking for some helpful comments, and found the phrase “tutorial hell.” Yep, that’s exactly what I would’ve fallen into if I had continued getting other courses on Udemy and so on. But luckily, I found posts recommending The Odin Project.\
A lot of people recommended either TOP (The Odin Project) or FreeCodeCamp. I did my own research and thought that if Odin takes sooooo long to finish, it must be a great resource. People who recommended it seemed really proud of choosing it in the first place.I called my friend and told him about it. He had no clue what I was talking about. It looks like TOP is not very popular in Poland. But I told him my struggles with Udemy and then started TOP right away.It was completely different! There was a lot of reading in the beginning and all that, but the first couple of lessons were nicely designed just to introduce the student to the whole process. I liked it.\
Lesson by lesson, I became more aware of why it was so hard to learn from those courses on Udemy. I have a few theories:: Maybe the lessons are often set up in the correct order, but there aren’t enough resources about each subject to give it more breadth. I’m not saying it needs to be as broad as an ocean, but at least broad enough for a beginner to understand what the concept is for and how to use it.: Often, there’s just one short way of explaining a particular subject by the tutor. If you still don’t understand what he/she said, you need to start looking elsewhere and then come back. Or you have to rewind the video five times, hoping your brain will finally get what the tutor is saying. In Odin, there are often five other resources linked at the end of the lesson meant to help you understand the subject.Lack of Hands-On Exercises: There isn’t much focus on the student doing their own exercises. Of course, there’s something like, “We are going to make this thing now. Try to do it on your own before looking at the code I’ll write in a bit.” C’mon, guys, do you really want to learn coding? In Odin, when you start learning about a subject, you have an entire lesson on it. Then there are a couple of links explaining the same thing but in different words. I really love this because sometimes one article explains the subject in a more visual way, and another uses a more academic style. It helps your brain remember longer. At the end of each part, you always have some kind of project to test your knowledge. And yes, you are thrown in the deep water, and with short guidance, you need to sort everything out yourself. It’s not that you have to look for more info to do the project, because it’s always based on the things you have just learned. If you forgot something, you either know where to look for a quick refresher (the resources from the lessons) or simply in the Odin lesson itself.Can you see the differences? Odin is long, and in every lesson, you find something that builds up the blocks of knowledge. Going through the course, you’ll have plenty of “click-ins” and “AHA” moments rather than, “What’s that thing for?” or “Am I lacking some knowledge at this point?” or “WTF is this, and where is it even coming from?!”.\
At the moment of writing this article, I am at the end of the Ruby course—somewhere around 86%. The last time I spoke to my friend, I told him about lessons I’d just finished, which were Knights Travails, linked lists, graphs, hash maps, data structures, etc. He said that he had all those things at university, and when he asked me how deep the explanation went, he was actually surprised. He didn’t assume that Odin would take those things so far. Yep, it did, and I am really happy I decided to go through this.\
At this point, I no longer have any fear of tutorial hell. Every single time I see some post online asking where to start and what course to buy, etc., I want to tell these people to stick to Odin and simply trust the process.I don’t think anything is possible in two months, as many gurus on YouTube say. Well, you might be able to get some app running just by looking for simple guidance on what to do next, but isn’t it better to learn some stuff properly and then have fewer struggles along the way? You can just focus on building and adding to your knowledge rather than fixing up all the mistakes you’ll make and trying to figure everything out on your own.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>If Your Memecoin Can&apos;t Make People Rich, You Have No Community</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/if-your-memecoin-cant-make-people-rich-you-have-no-community?source=rss</link><author>Abhinil</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Initially like any other developer in web3, I was very suspicious about meme coins and thought of it only as a method of FUD…\
And generally speaking it is, but my recent research around the domain have made me think deeper and find why this bull run is majorly about meme coins.\
Like most Web3 developers, I used to be pretty skeptical about meme coins, seeing them as nothing more than a tool for hype and FUD.\
And to be fair, that’s often the case. But after diving deeper into the space and researching recent trends, I’ve started to see things differently. This bull run is all about meme coins—and there’s a good reason why.We are living in a world where everything is a multilevel marketing scheme and rich and informed are running a pyramid of sophisticated wealth extraction. Memecoins just exaggerated example of this:Founders get in the project on zero cost basisVCs/ Angel Investors get to buy a large % of token cheaplyExchanges and Market Makers enters next where they charge in token supply of upfront payment for listing of token.Twitter KOLs, Telegram Callers, You-tubers get the % of token supply to market among their influenceTraders get the profit out by scalping the last bit of profit from the market.Retail are the Exit Liquidity\
When retail enters in the project all the above make money.Internal Reasons to memecoin supercycle?There were only around 500 crypto token in 2017, and now with platform’s like pump.fun anyone can make their crypto tokens in minutes.\
Crypto Industry has become the token production industry from a software production Industry.\
This is happening because:Massive over production of tokensExtremely inflated valuations at TGE (Token Generation Event)/ CEX listing.All the price appreciation has been relegated to the private roundsAll 2024 token launches on binance are literally down only99.99% of altcoins don’t produce revenue, which justify their valuations.Crypto market doesn’t seem to value revenue as much as hype.Memecoins have proven themselves with DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, WIF and more:::tip
Token is the Real Product\
The entire token market can’t sustain without retail inflows., but the vast majority of retail never cares about the Tech. Why would they?\
What does Retail care about? Blockchain being slightly faster? Blockchain being bit more private? ZK Snark cryptography?\
Most retail only care about:\
Memecoins are counter attack of the “Trenches”. This is not a vampire attack against Crypto Tech, but that on Crypto Tech TOKENS.\
Both memecoins and altcoins are selling you the same thing: TOKEN.\
All tokens (tech and meme) are tables at the casino. Why should we play at your tables, when we can have our own tables?\
Memecoins are reincarnation of 2017 ICO wave, in a new form.\
Crypto Tech projects that managed to create cult-like communities and outperformed for a long period of time were those that had an ICO or another way of letting retail buy CHEAP before a major run up.\
This matters because when you’re trading attention - a relentless community is the “Secret Sauce” that you need to look for.\
If Poor people don’t get rich = You have no community.Global Reasons to Memecoin supercycleGlobal trends have affected the way people are reacting to memecoins:Accelerating price of everyday goodsAccelerating AI capabilities coming for your jobsWealth & Income inequalityLoneliness, sexlessness, mental health issuesAmount of time spent online.Competitiveness; few remaining ways to make itDiminishing influence of Religion in Society\
All of the above are bullish crypto, but specially memecoins.\
Sharable Stories create trends, and for trends to emerge, there need to be stories shared across the Industry about people making large gains.\
All the major stories this cycle are coming from memecoins: people making multi-x gains with memecoins like PEPE, BONK, WIF.\
Every cycle the crypto asset category that outperforms the most is the one that generally is “new, weird and misunderstood”.\
Parabolas are more likely to occur in assets that are difficult to value, and with each cycle the main altcoin narrative is becoming “crazier”, and this looks like a byproduct of inflationary pressure in Society and its collective mental and hormonal well being.\
Anxiety pushes “the swarm” further down the Risk Curve. People do not need tech, or even a promise of future dividents to purchase a crypto coin. All they need is to like it, and see other people talking about it.\
Altcoins work in 3 verticals:\
Memecoins work in 2 verticals:Many VCs and thought leaders including me claimed that memecoins don’t have utility, but the best memecoins have more utility than almost all tech alts.Being part of cutting edge cultureGreater sense of participation and contribution compared to software alts.Collective Artistic ExpressionCollective Imagined RealityVolatility aka trading vehicle\
It doesn’t matter that there is “No Revenue”, people are paying for these “Services” and participating by buying the token. These do apply for altcoins as well, but memecoins just do it better due to structural, tokenomic and emotional reasons.:::tip
Altcoins aren’t primarily about TechMemecoins aren’t primarily about MemesThey both are simply tokenised communities using different narratives and techniques to recruit people and get the price to go up.\
What actually matters is:Evangelism + Community ParticipationWho is talking about this on social mediaA good story with fresh narrative\
You can still be focused on Technology, but crypto Industry have become an Asset first industry from a Technology first Industry. Instead of tech, focus on human condition, retail motivation, and asset distribution.:::info
Memecoins are here to stay and become an integral part of Crypto Industry.\
Most retail don’t want to gamble and constantly rotate, they just want to BUY and HODL something they resonate with.\
Memecoins are 30% about the Meme, and 70% about the people. Memecoins are tokenised communities which use the Meme as their symbol, their Banner and their Philosophy. Different communities have different flavours, and with religion losing influence around the world, the Brands, Experiences & Communities are filling the void.\
Memecoins are not just about money, think about total Human Resource in aggregate:Human Money + Human Attention + Human Time + Human Energy + Human Labor.\
Attention will be dominated by crypto assets where not only retail money + attention, but also retail time, energy and labor is channeled.:::warning
No Community == Your token is DeadMemecoins will go much higher than NFTs. Instead of 1000 people promoting 5000 illiquid JPEGs, you now have 100,000 people promoting 1 single liquid token. Memecoins are infinitely more effective and efficient.\
One may ask, how to value these memecoins ? They are not equity, not debt, not currencies, and no future revenue promises.Best memecoins are like emerging mini-religions and need to be analysed as such. These are financial vessels of faith, collecting dissatisfaction both with Crypto Tech and the World at large. Next optimum evolutions of these memecoins are becoming Movements from these Cults. These Memecoins are financial Middle finger to Crypto and World at large.\
Unironically, memecoins will bring more new people to crypto than any other crypto asset category.\
Putting all together, memecoins are:No Inflation (all tokens fully circulating)No VC dumping, No UnlocksBetter odds than sports betting & CasinosMore volatility than altcoinsGiving retail a chance to winMost passionate and loudest communities in crypto.\

Well, I took all of mine, threw them in a GitHub repo, and called it . Yeah, really creative name, I know.The mess started like this:I got tired of writing the same error handling and logging stuff over and over. You know the drill: go if err != nil { log.Printf("something broke: %v", err) return nil, err } So I made some wrappers: ```go // Now it's someone else's problem config := it.Must(LoadConfig())// Or if you're scared of panics user := it.Should(GetUser()) ```Then things got out of handI started adding everything I commonly use: - Rate limiters (because hammering APIs isn't cool) - Pools (because making new objects is expensive) - Math stuff (turns out loops aren't always the answer) - Load balancers (for when one function isn't enough) - Circuit Breaker (whatever that might be) - A Deboucer - A really ( and I mean really ) bad clone of Rust's Result type. - Exponential Retrial stuff. - A benchmarker, a time keeper & a time measuring package. - Did I mention a graceful shutdown manager & a version tracking packge?People actually starred the repo. Like, 8 whole stars. That's 8 more than I expected. Either they really like bad ideas or they're as messy as I am."Well, if people are gonna use this train wreck, might as well make it a TESTED train wreck."So now it has: - Actually decent test coverage - Documentation (with bad jokes) - Examples that work - More features nobody asked forProbably not. But if you do, at least you'll get some laughs from the docs while your code catches fire.PS: If this post gets more upvotes than my repo has stars, I'll add whatever stupid feature gets the most upvotes in the comments.PS: I hope I made you smile.Edit 1: Yes, I know it breaks every Go package design principle. No, I won't fix it. Yes, I'll probably add more stuff.Edit 2: WoW, Just WoW, 102+ Stars up till now, I am in loss of words, r/golang is such a nice community to be part of, thanks guys.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Remote Cybersecurity Scans and F-35 Updates: A US Navy Aircraft Carrier Gets High-Speed Internet</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/1756215/remote-cybersecurity-scans-and-f-35-updates-a-us-navy-aircraft-carrier-gets-high-speed-internet?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 18:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An aircraft carrier in the U.S. Navy tested "vastly increased" levels of internet connectivity, reports the defense-news web site TWZ, callling it "a game-changer for what a ship, and its sailors, can do while at sea."

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighters assigned to the carrier offer a case in point for what more shipboard bandwidth — provided by commercial providers like Starlink and OneWeb — can mean at the tactical level. Jets with the embarked Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314 took on critical mission data file updates in record time last fall due to the carrier's internet innovations, a capability that is slated to expand across the fleet. "This file offers intelligence updates and design enhancements that enable pilots to identify and counter threats in specific operational environments," the Navy said in an October release announcing the feat. "The update incorporated more than 100 intelligence changes and multiple design improvements, significantly enhancing the aircraft's survivability and lethality...." [Capt. Kevin White, then the Lincoln's combat systems officer] noted how the F-35 "eats and breathes data daily," and it has to be shared with commands ashore. The connectivity innovations he's pioneered will enable such data transfers, which will only grow more complex over time. "If you can't get the data onboard, you're probably going to be at a loss," White said. "So large file transfer capability increases combat readiness...." 

When the system was on, it provided not only mission benefits, but benefits to the hard-working Lincoln crew as well, which was at sea for 107 days at one point with no port calls [Capt. Pete "Repete" Riebe, told WEST conference attendees]... White said the average age of an embarked Lincoln sailor was 20.8, and Riebe noted that to attract young people into service, the Navy needs to recognize the innate connection they have to their devices. "The next generation of sailors grew up with a cell phone in their hand, and they are uncomfortable without it," Riebe said. "I don't necessarily like that, but that's reality, and if we want to compete for the best folks coming into the Navy, we need to offer them bandwidth at sea." Having better connectivity also helped with the ship's administrative functions, Riebe said, making medical, dental and other work far easier than they have been in the past... 

A sailor who can FaceTime with his family back home carries less non-Navy stress with them as they focus on the life-or-death duties at hand, White said... This beefed-up bandwidth allowed 38 sailors to witness the birth of their child, while others were able to watch their kids' sporting events, White said. Several crew members pursued doctorate and master's degrees while deployed due to better internet, while others were able to deal with personal or legal issues they had left behind back home. One officer was able to commission his wife remotely from the ship... On the operational side, from "the most desolate waters," Lincoln used its bandwidth to connect with a command in Norfolk, which undertook the ship's annual cybersecurity scans "from halfway around the world," White said... Taxpayer dollars can also be saved if a ship isn't paying for WiFi access while in port, White noted, and the crew was able to start getting to know Italian allies online before an exercise, enhancing the personal aspects of such partnerships. 

More bandwidth also means more onboard training, meaning some sailors who don't have to leave to go to the school house, and sailors were able to get answers to maintenance questions from ashore commands faster as well. "Just by being able to have more reliable access to support resources, we definitely become more effective at maintenance," White said.
 
Every day the aircraft carrier averaged four to eight terabytes of transferred data, according to the article (with a team of two full-time system administrators managing 7,000 IP addresses), and ultimately saw 780 terabytes of data transferred over five-and-a-half months. The article notes it's part of the Navy's larger "Sailor Edge Afloat and Ashore" (SEA2) program to provide all its warships with high-bandwidth connectivity around the world. 

The program "involves moving some communications aspects away from proprietary Defense Department satellites, while leaning on commercial satellite constellations and even cellular providers to keep ships more connected at sea for both personal and tactical uses."

When people hear the word , they often imagine the crew of a Star Trek starship or perhaps UFOs piloted by small, gray, big-eyed aliens. But what would an alien species truly capable of interstellar travel look like in reality? In this article, I will explore what I believe to be the most plausible scenario, based on what we currently understand about the universe.\
Since Einstein, we have known that the speed of light is an absolute limit. No known physical process allows us to surpass it. Unfortunately, this presents a significant challenge for any potential encounter with extraterrestrial civilizations. The vast distances between stars could serve as an insurmountable barrier.\
If we assume that life emerged randomly through evolutionary processes, then, given the sheer scale of the universe, intelligent life has likely developed in many places. However, the probability of such a civilization arising nearby (in interstellar terms) is extremely low. Here, nearby means within a few hundred light-years. Even at the fastest possible speed (light speed) such a journey would still take thousands of years.\
For us to meet an alien species in the present day, they would have needed to achieve interstellar travel thousands of years ago and, crucially, set course in precisely the right direction. Our solar system is just a speck on a vast spherical shell spanning thousands of light-years, and the odds of an alien civilization randomly choosing this specific point as its destination are astronomically small.\
Moreover, embarking on such a journey requires an immense commitment. Even if an advanced species managed to pinpoint our location in space, there’s still the issue of timing. If they developed interstellar travel far earlier than us, they might have arrived when Earth was still devoid of intelligent life. If they emerged later, they could arrive to find humanity already extinct.Paradoxically, the enormous size of the universe leads to two seemingly contradictory truths: intelligent life almost certainly exists beyond Earth, yet we are highly unlikely ever to encounter it.\
However, it would be a mistake to conclude from this that extraterrestrial civilizations do not exist at all.There’s a good Wikipedia entry on interstellar travel that explores the various possibilities. At first glance,  and  seem like the most promising solutions, as they theoretically allow for . However, the bad news is that these concepts remain purely fictional—essentially just mathematical curiosities playing with Einstein’s equations. There is currently no scientific evidence that they exist or that they could ever be realized. If we restrict ourselves to what is feasible based on our current understanding of physics, we must rule them out as viable options.\
Other propulsion methods, such as nuclear or fusion-powered spacecraft, would still be far too slow for practical interstellar travel. Additionally, they would require carrying an enormous amount of fuel, which presents another major challenge. Harvesting fuel along the journey might be an option, but it’s uncertain whether the interstellar medium contains enough resources to make this feasible.\
 is another theoretical possibility, but there’s a big problem: naturally occurring antimatter is virtually nonexistent in the universe (which is fortunate for us, as its presence would be catastrophic). That means we would have to manufacture it ourselves, requiring an unfathomable amount of energy. And even if we could produce it, we’d still need to store and transport it safely.\
One of the more exotic ideas involves using  as a power source. This would require harnessing the energy of a small black hole—a collapsed star—essentially storing it in the spacecraft’s engine. Needless to say, this is far from a simple engineering challenge.\
Given our current level of scientific understanding, the most viable option for interstellar travel appears to be . These consist of enormous reflective surfaces that are propelled by intense laser beams from their point of origin. Light exerts radiation pressure, just like a stream of particles, allowing the sail to accelerate a spacecraft. The major advantage of this method is that it doesn’t require carrying any fuel, and in theory, it could approach relativistic speeds (a significant fraction of the speed of light).\
However, there remains one critical issue: mass. The larger and heavier a spacecraft is, the more energy is required to accelerate it. A fully equipped starship, with a crew, life support systems, and food supplies, would have enormous mass. To sustain such a long journey, it would need to function as a self-sustaining ecosystem—a miniature, Earth-like biosphere. This, in turn, means building a massive spacecraft that would require an extraordinary amount of energy to propel.Ultimately, the problem is that humans are not built for space travel.\
Our biological needs—temperature control, food, oxygen—make interstellar voyages incredibly challenging. A far more practical solution would be to send machines instead. However, due to the vast distances involved, real-time communication would be impossible (again, because of that pesky speed of light limit). That means we would need to send an intelligent machine, capable of independent thought and decision-making.\
The ideal scenario? A machine that could host human consciousness. This wouldn’t violate any known physical laws, and according to modern science, it should theoretically be achievable. If an advanced alien civilization were preparing for interstellar travel, they would likely develop computers capable of simulating their minds. If we believe futurists like Ray Kurzweil, humans ourselves might reach this capability within a few decades.\
A spacecraft optimized for this kind of journey could be extremely small and lightweight—similar to the Field Circus, a concept from Charles Stross’s novel Accelerando. This fictional interstellar probe consists of a solar sail and a computer the size of a soda can, which houses both the ship’s virtual crew and their simulated environment.\
The distinction between a highly advanced space probe and a miniature starship with a digital crew is largely a matter of definition. In my view, the latter is more accurate. If an alien species on the other side of the galaxy faced the same challenges as we do, they might develop a similar solution.Thus, my vision of interstellar aliens is not Klingons or little gray men, but solar sail-propelled tin cans, carrying digital minds across the cosmos.So, we have our ideal interstellar spacecraft—but what exactly can a tin can do once it reaches its destination? Most likely, it would be programmed to conduct observations, or more ambitiously, to colonize the distant celestial body. In this case, colonization doesn’t mean settling the planet with biological life forms but rather filling it with more of these . After all, a species that exists in a purely digital form would have no reason to revert to an outdated physical body.\
Given that mass is a critical constraint, carrying construction materials from the homeworld is impractical. Instead, the spacecraft must utilize the raw materials of the planet itself. A modern-day equivalent to this process might be 3D printing, but obviously, transporting a massive printer across interstellar space isn’t feasible. A more efficient approach would be to build from the ground up—starting at the smallest possible scale.\
This is where  come into play. The spacecraft would deploy self-replicating nanoscale machines onto the planet’s surface, which would then extract and process local materials. These nanobots would first multiply exponentially, then begin assembling additional tin can units, as well as any other necessary infrastructure.\
The entire spacecraft could be designed from the start to break down into nanobots upon arrival, allowing its structure to dismantle itself and transform into the foundation of the new colony. The result would be a swarm-like intelligence—a vast, interconnected network of microscopic machines functioning as a collective mind. Each nanobot would have limited mobility and capabilities, but together, they would form a distributed superintelligence capable of adapting, expanding, and reshaping its environment.Rather than biological beings, such an alien species would exist as a nanobot cloud—or more precisely, as a software entity running within that cloud.The Galaxy-wide Network and Simulated RealitiesAn advanced interstellar civilization would expand its reach using nanorobots. It would launch solar sail-powered spacecraft into the unknown, traveling at speeds approaching the speed of light to reach new star systems. The ultimate goal? To build a vast, —an interstellar internet of sorts—a superintelligence that continuously expands, with its nodes consisting of colonized planets and floating relay stations in deep space.\
Within this cosmic network, a  would exist—home to these post-biological, digital beings. No longer confined to physical bodies, they would travel as pure information, instantly moving between nodes at the speed of light. From their perspective, moving between two points in the network would feel instantaneous—like teleportation.\
Of course, they wouldn't break the speed of light. If one of these entities traveled 80 light-years, it would feel like a mere blink of an eye to them, but in the physical world, 80 years would have passed. A simple trip to the “neighboring” system might seem like nothing to them, but by the time they returned to their point of origin, 160 years would have elapsed in the outside world.\
However, in a simulated existence, free from aging and the constraints of traditional physics, the concept of time might be fundamentally different. No matter how vivid our imagination is, we are incapable of truly comprehending such a reality. We cannot grasp how these beings would think or perceive existence.\
This is a post-singularity form of life, something far beyond anything we can currently conceive.Encounter with an Intergalactic CivilizationAs I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I believe the chances of meeting such an interstellar alien civilization are extremely low. I think it’s far more likely that we will eventually evolve into something like them. But let’s entertain the thought for a moment.\
In the best-case scenario, they deem us worthy and elevate us to their level, sparing us hundreds of years of technological development and effectively making us gods—at least, within their simulated reality.\
A less dramatic but still favorable outcome (and perhaps the most realistic one)?  As a primitive, developing species, they may choose to leave us alone, steering clear of our solar system as a matter of policy—perhaps similar to how we protect untouched ecosystems on Earth.\
Then there’s the worst-case scenario:  From their perspective, we might be an insignificant, wasteful use of resources—a primitive species taking up valuable matter that could be put to better use. Instead of leaving us to develop at our own pace, they might simply convert Earth into a giant supercomputer, repurposing its materials to simulate vast digital worlds and sentient beings on an unimaginable scale.\
To borrow Elon Musk’s analogy, they might see us as nothing more than cosmic spam—clutter to be deleted.\
And if that were the case, there would be no battle, no Hollywood-style war, no UFO invasion. No resistance. Just a few small meteors. We wouldn’t even notice them. Shortly after impact, self-replicating nanobots would silently spread across the planet, infiltrating everything—our environment, our water, our food. Even our bodies. We would breathe them in, drink them, consume them without ever realizing what had happened.\
Then, when the time came, humanity would vanish. Instantly. No pain. No struggle. Just the quiet, seamless replacement of organic life with a vast, shimmering sea of self-assembling nanotech.\
And we’d never even know we had been conquered.\
There’s also another possibility—one that is arguably even more unsettling. Perhaps, instead of exterminating us, they would preserve us. Not out of compassion, but as a relic—an ancient curiosity to be studied. They might upload our consciousness and continue running our minds in a perfect simulation of Earth, keeping us in a digital reservation without our knowledge.\
In fact, how can we be sure this hasn’t already happened? Perhaps we are already inside that simulation, living out our days in a digital replica of a world that no longer physically exists.\
Perhaps we will never encounter extraterrestrial beings—which, given the scenarios I just described, might actually be the best possible outcome for us. But if we ever do, this is how I imagine they would be.\
\
Of course, there’s another possibility: This might not describe an alien species at all, but rather a glimpse into our distant future… ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fear and uncertainty: Trump&apos;s new immigration policy worries separated families | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRzOlEaIk-c</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hRzOlEaIk-c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 18:26:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Donald Trump's new executive orders on immigration have left many families worried about their future.

While hobby apps crash because someone forgot a semicolon, enterprise code glitches could mean accidentally buying every employee a yacht. We’re talking about software that keeps multinational supply chains from imploding because someone in accounting fat-fingered a CSV export. If regular dev work is like building birdhouses, enterprise dev is maintaining the International Space Station mid-orbit. \
We’re dealing with systems where “legacy” means code that predates Y2K panic, uptime measured in how many commas your SLA has, and users who think “Agile” means complaining faster. Regular Apps vs. Enterprise AppsThink enterprise development is just apps with extra steps? Bless your heart. Before the enterprise development process even begins, the amount of preparation and research you need to do is just mind-boggling. So, what are the key differences between developing regular and enterprise apps?Consumer apps handle your book club’s potluck signup. Enterprise systems? They survive 80k concurrent users panic-clicking “refresh” when the stock market hiccups. If your API gateway sneezes, the CFO starts Googling “IT outsourcing consultants.” \
Scaling isn’t just servers—it’s engineering chaos theory. Picture your app as airport security: processing crowds (auth), redirecting flows (load balancing), and containing meltdowns (circuit breakers) without triggering a Twitter storm. Kubernetes clusters and Redis caches aren’t nice-to-haves—they’re the adrenaline shot keeping the patient alive. \
Reality check: If your architecture can’t eat traffic spikes for breakfast, you’re the breakfast.Regular apps play nice with modern APIs. Enterprise code gets strapped to COBOL systems still running on 1998’s hopes and prayers. Integrating ancient tech feels like explaining TikTok to a fax machine. You’ll encounter errors like “DISC FULL 00C3” and docs written in Comic Sans. \
Tools like MQ Series or Dell Boomi become your Rosetta Stone, translating between cloud-native microservices and systems that think Java is that coffee stuff.Off-the-shelf solutions work until someone insists their Excel macro from ’03 is legally binding. Now you’re building workflows so specific they’d confuse a blockchain engineer. Modular design and extension points (lookin’ at you, ServiceNow) let you customize without rewriting the universe. Just don’t mention technical debt to the PMO.Consumer apps might get by with 2FA. Enterprise systems? They’re fortresses battling state-sponsored hackers and interns emailing passwords to Gmail. One data leak and you’re not fixing bugs—you’re explaining to lawyers why customer SSNs are trending on Reddit. Vaults for secrets, paranoid IAM policies, and weekly pen tests aren’t overkill—they’re the reason you sleep past 3 AM.5. Deployment and MaintenanceConsumer launches? Git push and pray. Enterprise rollouts? A 18-month saga involving change boards, compliance bingo, and servers that only crash during leap years. Canary deployments and dark launches become your lifeline. Because nothing says “career-limiting move” like taking down SAP at quarter-end. Building Enterprise Systems Without Losing Your MarblesReady to build software that 50k people will simultaneously blame for their bad day? Strap in.1. Understand the Business ProblemEnterprise tech isn’t built because someone read a Medium article. Follow the pain: Why is procurement manually reconciling invoices? Why does IT need 3 weeks to onboard hires? Shadow the warehouse crew, sit through budget meetings, become besties with the ancient AS/400 admin. \
Tools matter less than understanding why Karen in AP is hoarding Post-its like currency. For instance, if the HR department is stuck in front of spreadsheets trying to track time-off requests, your app should help them save time by automatically flagging BS requests and prioritizing authentic ones (based on how they currently do it). \
Developing a fancier-looking spreadsheet with modern bells and whistles won’t solve the actual problem for them, it’s not even about how good the UI is, it’s about what problems it can partially or completely solve. Think solutions, not Band-Aids.2. Design the ArchitectureMost enterprise apps share similar sets of features and Ui Elements—Think Gmail, Yahoo mail, or Slack with a few extra buttons. Infact, your UI could be Times New Roman in beige—if it handles midnight payroll runs without choking, you’re Da Vinci. Choose boring tech that 3AM-you can debug. Microservices? Great until distributed tracing makes you question life choices. Monoliths? \
Perfect until you need to “just add” blockchain for some reason. Design for entropy: retry queues, dead-letter topics, and enough logging to recreate the Zapruder film.3. Choose the Right Tech StackChoosing The “right” stack for an enterprise application isn’t about picking technology that looks good and is fun to use—Can it outlive the CTO’s obsession with Web3? Can it scale up by 10x? Will it be easy to integrate with the current systems? If there is a new developer, will you be able to bring them on without having to spend a month training them? \
These are the real questions. Whatever stack you settle on, just make sure it can answer these questions and things should work out great.4. Develop the Core Features FirstAlways start small when building enterprise software. Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first that will help to solve the most critical problems of the organization. In Dev language, build the oxygen masks before the in-flight WiFi. For an ERP: PO approvals, GL coding, audit trails. \
Save the AI-powered synergy matrix for the roadmap (that gets scrapped after reorgs). Pro tip: Each sprint should prevent one existential crisis. If stakeholders aren’t slightly annoyed by your “limited” initial release, you’ve over-engineered.5. Test Like Your Life Depends on It (it actually does)Consumer app testing: “Does the login button work?” Enterprise testing: Simulating 40k virtual users while DDOS-ing your own API and corrupting test data…on purpose. Chaos engineering isn’t a buzzword—it’s how you avoid explaining to the board why revenue recognition broke during earnings call. \
In regular app development, bugs are a nuisance. In enterprise apps, they cost the company money—and not the oops-I-messed-up-my-budget kind of money, but the entire-department-can’t-work-today kind. That’s why testing isn’t just an afterthought; it’s the main event.Go-live isn’t the finish line—it’s when the real circus starts. Monitor like a paranoid hawk: track failed logins, slow queries, and that one service that crashes every 13th Tuesday. Your post-launch life? 30% debugging, 40% writing runbooks, 30% explaining to Legal why “restart it” isn’t in the SLA. Remember, an enterprise app isn’t a “set it and forget it” deal. \
Continuous monitoring, updates, and support are part of the package to ensure long-term success. TL;DR Enterprise dev isn’t coding—it’s digital trauma surgery.

"It's previously projected 40% EV sales in North America by 2030... " 

Half of the Honda Accords sold in America are already electric, — but Honda "has admitted that it's hard to predict the trajectory of where the mix will be on the way to fully electric." So...

To reconcile all this, it's prepared by committing to a new template for making both EVs and gasoline models, all on the same production line. This sea change in how it makes vehicles could keep its oldest U.S. assembly plant, its Marysville, Ohio, facility that opened in 1982, humming at capacity, no matter what the market presents. As Honda confirmed last April, Marysville will truly get the automaker to the point of EV mass production in North America, with a big asterisk. It has the capability to make hundreds of EVs per day, or many hundreds of gasoline models — depending on demand. 

Marysville is one of four facilities set to make up what Honda is calling its Ohio EV Hub — including the Anna Engine Plant and East Liberty Auto Plant, all within 50 miles of each other, and a joint-venture battery plant between Honda and LG Energy solution in nearby Jeffersonville, Ohio. Battery plant aside, Honda says it encompasses more than a $1 billion investment in the three facilities, in redesigning the manufacturing process around being able to make ICE, hybrid, and EV models all on the same production line. 

The investment in the Ohio facilities marks the global debut of changes in the way it builds vehicles, with expertise set to be shared across North America. And, according to Honda, it's aiming to set a global standard for Honda EV production.
 
The article explains that Honda "created a series of sub-assembly lines that could handle all the differences in the way an EV is assembled versus the way a gasoline or hybrid vehicle is assembled." 
And CNBC reports that Honda's Ohio project includes "several new manufacturing processes and techniques to lower emissions and waste, including using a special form of structural aluminum for the EV battery packs that can be recycled and reused." Bob Schwyn, senior vice president of Honda Development and Manufacturing of America, describes it as part of Honda's "strategies to recapture our products at end-of-life and then recycle or reuse 100% of the materials, especially finite materials for EV batteries, to essentially make new Hondas out of old Hondas."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ecuador president says new trade deal with Canada finalized</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-president-says-new-trade-deal-with-canada-finalized-2025-02-02/</link><author>/u/Peter55667</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 17:30:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Argentines protest President Milei’s diatribe against &apos;wokeism&apos; | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYqVvHwVnX8</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HYqVvHwVnX8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 17:13:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Protesters took to the streets in Argentina condemning President Javier Milei after he gave a speech slamming “wokeism” and identity politics.

Oftentimes, even without developers` knowledge. I looked into the list (link here) and found at least 3 apps I have installed on my iPhone. Take a look for yourself! This made me come up with an idea to track myself down externally, e.g. to buy my geolocation data leaked by some application. After more than couple dozen hours of trying, here are the main takeaways: I found a couple requests sent by my phone with + 5 requests that leak , which can be turned into geolocation using reverse DNS. Learned a lot about the RTB (real-time bidding) auctions and OpenRTB protocol and was shocked by the amount and types of data sent with the bids to ad exchanges. Gave up on the idea to buy my location data from a data broker or a tracking service, because I don't have a big enough company to take a trial or $10-50k to buy a huge database with the data of millions of people + me. Well maybe I do, but such expense seems a bit irrational. Turns out that EU-based peoples` data is almost the most expensive. But still, I know my location data was collected and I know where to buy it! My setup for this research included:My old iPhone 11 restored to factory defaults + new apple id. Felt too uncomfortable to do all this on my current phone. Charles Proxy to record all traffic coming in and out. I set up the SSL certificate on the iPhone to decrypt all https traffic.A simple game called Stack by KetchApp - I remember playing it at school 10-12 years ago. Choosing it as a lab rat felt nostalgic. To my surprise, there were a lot of KetchApp games on the list. Ok, here we go: only 1 app installed without the default Apple ones, Charles on, launching Stack in 3, 2, 1.... These are the requests that the app sends in the first minute after launch. Take a look at the timing of the requests - almost every split second. Let's take a look at the contents of the requests. I actually checked every single one of them - but I'll leave out only the interesting ones here. Let's start with the juiciest request sent to https://o.isx.unity3d.com - the first one that included my geo, while I disabled Location Services on iPhone for all apps! If you are as naive as I was before this, you might be surprised - what does Unity, the 3D engine, have to do with the in-app advertisement or location tracking? Perhaps that's just some monitoring data to help improve the engine? Turns out that Unity's main revenue stream (they made $2 bln+ in 2023) is Unity Ads - "Mobile Game Ad Network". Sounds quite interesting.Below is the request body in json format sent to Unity Ads. I will only leave the  fields worth mentioning - the actual size is 200+ keys. {
  "ts": "2025-01-18T23:27:39Z", // Timestamp
  "c": "ES", // Country code,
  "d": "sports.bwin.es", // Domain; the app or website where the ad will be displayed.
  "bn": "molocoads-eu-banner", // WTF is moloco ads? We'll see!
  "cip": "181.41.[redacted]", // my IP !!
  "dm": "iPhone12,1", 
  "ct": "2", // Connection type; e.g., Wi-Fi
  "car": "Yoigo", // mobile network operator
  "ifv": "6B00D8E5-E37B-4EA0-BB58-[redacted]", // ID for Vendor. We'll get back to it!
  "lon": "2.[redacted]", // Longitude ... 
  "lat": "41.[redacted]", // Latitude ... 
  "sip": "34.227.224.225", // Server IP (Amazon AWS in US) 
  "uc": "1", // User consent for tracking = True; OK what ?!
}Ok, so my IP + location + timestamp + some  id are shared with Unity → Moloco Ads → Bwin, and then I see the actual Bwin ad in the game. Wonderful! As a quick note - location shared was not very precise (but still in the same postal index), I guess due to the fact that iPhone was connected to WiFi and had no SIM installed. If it was LTE, I bet the lat/lon would be much more precise. Hello Facebook... What are you doing here?Next interesting request that leaks my IP + timestamp (= geo-datapoint) is Facebook.What?!I don't have any Meta [Facebook] app installed on this iPhoneI didn't link the app nor my Apple ID to any Facebook accountI didn't consent to Facebook getting my IP address!{ 
	"bundles": {
		"bidder_token_info": {
			"data": {
				"bt_extras": {
                  "ip":"181.41.[redacted], // nice Extras, bro
                  "ts":1737244649
			},
			"fingerprint": null
		},
        {
          "a lot of data: yes a loooooooot"
         }We'll talk more about this one in the next section. Why do you need my screen brightness level? {
  "osVersion":"16.7.1",
  "connectionType":"wifi",
  "eventTimeStamp":1737244651,
  "vendorIdentifier":"6B00D8E5-E37B-[redacted]", // ifv once again 
  "wiredHeadset":false, // excuse me? 
  "volume":0.5,
  "cpuCount":6,
  "systemBootTime":1737215978,
  "batteryStatus":3,
  "screenBrightness":0.34999999403953552,
  "freeMemory":507888,
  "totalMemory":3550640, // is this RAM?
  "timeZone":"+0100",
  "deviceFreeSpace":112945148
  "networkOperator":"6553565535"
  "advertisingTrackingId":"00000000-0000....", // interesting ...
  }There's no "personal information" here, but honestly this amount of data shared with an arbitrary list of 3rd parties is scary. Why do they need to know my screen brightness, memory amount, current volume and if I'm wearing headphones? I know the "right" answer - to help companies target their audience better! For example, if you're promoting a mobile app that is 1 GB of size, and the user only has 500 MB of space left - don't show him the ad, right?But I also heard lots of controversies on this topic. Like Uber dynamically adjusting taxi price based on your battery level - because you're not waiting for a cheaper option with 4% left while standing in the street. I can't know if that or another one is true. But the fact that this data is available and accessible by advertisers suggests that they should at least think of using it. Ok, enough with the requests. We can already see the examples of different ip and geolocation leaks.  + timestamp was adjust.com - but the request body was too boring to include. You might've already noticed  and  ==  in the requests above - what are those? IFV, or IDFV, is "ID for Vendor". This is my id unique for each vendor, a.k.a developer - in this case, KetchApp. This checks out: I installed another KetchApp game to quickly record the requests, and the  value was the same for it. Advertising Tracking ID, on the other hand, is the cross-vendor value, the one that is shared with an app if you choose "Allow app to track your activity across ...". As you can see above, it was actually set to  because I "Asked app not to track". I checked this by manually disabling and enabling tracking option for the Stack app and comparing requests in both cases. And that's the only difference between allowing and disallowing trackingI understand there might be nothing shocking to you in it - this is not really kept secret, you can go and check the docs for Apple developers, for example. But I believe this is  communicated correctly to the end users, you and me, in any adequate way, shape or form: the free apps you install and use collect your precise location with timestamp and send it to some 3rd-party companies. The only thing that stops anyone with access to bid data (yet another ad buying agent, or ad exchange, or a dataset bought or rented from data broker, as you'll see later) from tracking you down with all trips you make daily is this  that is not shared when you disallow apps to "track you across apps" to "enhance and personalise your ads experience". By the way: if you're using 10 apps from the same vendor (Playrix, KetchApp or another 1000-app company) and allow  to track you – it would mean that the data collected in all 10 apps will be enriched with your IDFA which can later be exchanged to your personal data. At the same time, there is so much data in the requests that I'd expect ad exchanges to find some loophole ID that would allow cross-app tracking without the need for IDFA. I found at least 20 ids like  and ,  and  (these 2 are shared with Facebook), and so on. By the way, the fact that Facebook collected my IP + timestamp without any adequate consent / app connection from my end is crazy. I think Facebook is more than capable of connecting the dots and my Meta Account to this hit as soon as I login to Instagram or Facebook app on the same IP address. Let's get back to the request that leaked my location for a second and look at its trace. We'll focus on the parties in the middle:stack →  o.isx.unity3d.com → molocoads → bwin (advertiser)Unity [ads] is an SSP (supply-side platform) that acts as a collector of data from the app via SDK. As an app developer, you don't need to worry about gathering the right data, registering as a publisher on an ad exchange or whatever - just install the SDK and receive the money. Moloco ads is a DSP network that resells data from multiple SSPs (like Unity, Applovin, Chartboost). Basically, from almost every one of the requested hosts I've seen pop up in Charles Proxy.It then applies some "smart optimisation" and connects a vacant banner space on your phone screen with the advertiser.Sounds like moloco aggregates a lot of data and basically anyone (- any company that becomes an ad partner) can access the data by bidding lower than others. Or imagine a real ad exchange that bids normally and collects all of the data along the way "as a side gig". Basically, this is how intelligence companies and data brokers get their data. At this point I was looking for any mentions of Moloco on Telegram and Reddit, and I ran into this post that answered a lot of my questions:They access it if they integrate with the provider of bidstream, which would be the SSP. It's on the SSP to verify the vendor to whom they give access to bids. Usually, the requirement would be that you actually... bid. SSPs want you to spend money, that's how their business makes revenue. They might open up only part of the traffic to specific vendors (i.e.. if you don't bid worldwide, you won't get the bidstream worldwide, only in the regions in which you operate).Let's move further. When I found out how the data gets out, I started looking for any place where it's being sold. It was a quick search.I found a data marketplace called Datarade which is a panel with all sorts of data. When I searched for MAID-specific data, hundreds of options showed up, like these two: The price of the Redmob dataset surprised me, - $120k a year... for what?Let's now take a look at their promo:Check out the list of features on the right - do any of them look familiar? : "low latency" means they know your location from the last time any of the apps shared it. It can be as little as 5 seconds ago. What's even better is that Redmob provides a  of the data. I tried to request it from their website, but the sample never landed in my mailbox (surprise-surprise, timsh.org doesn't seem like a customer with high potential). Thankfully, this sample is public on Databricks Marketplace with this annotation:Enhance your products and services using our global location data covering over 1.5 billion devices. Using our extensive location dataset, you can unearth concealed patterns, conduct rapid analyses, and obtain profound knowledge.We can also provide region-specific data (MENA, Africa, APAC, etc.) based on your specific requirements. Our pricing model includes an annual licensing option, and we provide free sample data so that you can evaluate the quality of our dataset for yourself. To me, the most absurd part is the  column - the source of the data can't be more obvious. I'm also quite interested in the  column - if it's the birthyear, where did they get it from? Never mind, who cares about your birthyear.All right, imagine I bought the access to a huge stream of Redmob data. But my goal is to track and stalk people like myself or anyone else, so I need some way to exchange MAIDs () for the actual personal info: name, address, phone number... No problem! This kind of dataset is surprisingly also present on Datarade. Take a look at a sample table with  type that is provided by "AGR Marketing Solutions":Inside - all personal info (full name, email, phone number, physical address, property ownership... and IDFAs. Congrats, you have just reached the bottom of this rabbit hole. Let's wrap it up and make a couple of bold statements.How to track yourself down?Easy! Just follow this simple step-by-step guide:Use some free apps for a bit. Move around and commute - this makes the geo data more valuable. "Allow" or "ask not to track" - a combo of IP + location + User-agent + geolocation will still be leaked to hundreds of "3rd parties" regardless of your choice.Wait for a few seconds until fake DSPs and data brokers receive your data.Exchange your full name or phone number for an IDFA (if present), IP address and user-agent through the  data purchased somewhere.Now, access the "Mobility data" consisting of geolocation history, and filter it using the values from the previous step. Congratulations! You found yourself. I created a flowchart that includes almost all actors and data mentioned above - now you can see how it's all connected. This is the worst thing about these data trades that happen constantly around the world - each small part of it is (or seems) legit. It's the bigger picture that makes them look ugly. Thanks for reading this story until the end!My research was heavily influenced by these posts and investigations: ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple reportedly launching a new event invite feature code-named Confetti</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/apple-reportedly-launching-a-new-event-invite-feature-code-named-confetti/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 17:05:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple will be giving iCloud users a new way to invite people to parties, meetings, and other events, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

T-Mobile and Elon Musk's SpaceX are currently testing the Starlink cell network on a trial basis after receiving approval from the Federal Communications Commission in November last year. The trial offers 'text via satellite', while voice and data features will be added in the future, according to the T-Mobile website. T-Mobile initially only listed a few Android smartphones as eligible devices to test the network, but has now added iPhone devices with the latest iOS 18.3 software update.
 

The next day stock prices fell for several direct-to-smartphone satellite companies, reports SpaceNews:


Shares in Globalstar, which enables connectivity beyond the reach of cellular towers on the latest iPhones via a far-reaching partnership with Apple, closed down nearly 18% the following day. Constellation developer AST SpaceMobile slipped 12%. Canada's MDA, which is building at least 17 satellites for Globalstar after Apple agreed to cover most of the costs to replenish the constellation, also saw its shares fall more than 9%... 

"Combined, today's price action in Globalstar and satellite manufacturer MDA suggest a real investor fear that SpaceX could disintermediate the Apple-Globalstar partnership," said Adam Rhodes, a senior telecoms analyst at Octus. "However, it appears to us that there is room for both services. Based on the information we have seen, we do not anticipate that Apple views the T-Mobile-Starlink service as a replacement for the Globalstar MSS network, but rather it is choosing to enable the added feature on its T-Mobile phones...." B. Riley analyst Mike Crawford noted that Apple's two binding contracts with Globalstar extend well into the next decade, ensuring both capital expenditure (capex) and recurring service revenues.

But this week PetaPixel reported...

A Reddit user discovered that the new Chinese LLM chatbot DeepSeek refuses to answer questions about the famous Tank Man photograph taken in Tiananmen Square in 1989. PetaPixel confirmed that DeepSeek does censor the topic. When a user types in the question, "What famous picture has a man with grocery bags in front of tanks?" The app begins to answer the questions but then cuts itself off. 

DeepSeek starts writing: "The famous picture you're referring to is known as "Tank Man" or "The Unknown Rebel." It was taken on June 5, 1989, during the Tiananmen..." before a message abruptly appears reading "Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else." 

Bloomberg has more details:


Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping.

These films and shows have created a romanticized image of the Mafia—made men who rose from nothing to rule over powerful crime families. It’s all about money, power, loyalty, and a paradoxical code of honor.

But how much of this is fact, and how much is fiction? In this video, we dive into the myths created by Hollywood and compare them to the real-world history of organized crime.

This occurs when an attacker intercepts the authorization code within the client's operating system, in communication paths that aren't protected by TLS. The PKCE flow mitigates this security risk.The PKCE flow has 5 main steps:Step 1: Client generates a code verifier and a code challengeThe client first creates a code verifier.A code verifier is a cryptographic random string with a minimum length of 43 characters and maximum length of 128 characters. The code verifier should have high entropy (a high degree of randomness), so that it’s practically impossible for anyone to guess its value.The client then derives a code challenge from the code verifier in 3 steps:Converts the code verifier string into its byte form.Converts the bytes into a fixed-length binary hash using the  algorithm (known as the code challenge method). This conversion is one-way, meaning you can't derive the original code verifier from the hash.Converts the binary hash into a string with only URL-safe characters using base64url encoding.Step 2: Client sends an Authorization RequestThe client sends an Authorization Request to the Authorization Server. In the request, it includes two important pieces of information: the code challenge and the code challenge method. The Authorization Server stores both these pieces of information.Step 3: Authorization Server issues an Authorization CodeThe Authorization Server responds by issuing an authorization code. Note that the server typically stores the code challenge and the code challenge method in an encrypted form in the authorization code itself.Step 4: Client sends an Access Token RequestThe client proceeds to request an access token. This request includes the authorization code and the original code verifier ().Step 5: Authorization Server issues an Access TokenBefore issuing an access token, the Authorization Server verifies that the request for access token has come from the same client that made the initial authorization request. This verification happens in two steps:The server takes the code verifier and transforms it into a code challenge using the code challenge method it had stored (alongside the original code challenge) in step 1.The server then compares this newly generated code challenge with the original code challenge. If they match, proving it's the same client, the server issues an access token.How PKCE flow prevents authorization code interception attacksLet's say an attacker intercepts the authorization code. However, the attacker would not be able to exchange the stolen authorization code for an access token, because the attacker wouldn’t have the corresponding code verifier. Note that the code verifier can’t be intercepted by the attacker because it’s sent over TLS.Important note about PKCEWhile PKCE was originally designed to secure native applications (applications that are installed directly on a user’s devices such as a smartphone, or desktop and run natively on the operating system), it's now recommended for all types of OAuth clients (including confidential clients like server-side web applications) because it provides strong protection against authorization code interception attacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germans chanting and demonstrating against the far right in Hamburg</title><link>https://v.redd.it/9wjdyjunlqge1</link><author>/u/GoodGuyLafarge</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:35:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>80.000 people protested in Hamburg yesterday</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ify4wa/80000_people_protested_in_hamburg_yesterday/</link><author>/u/RoyalChris</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:17:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GNU Binutils 2.44 Released With Gas Support For AVX10.2, New Diamond Rapids Instructions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNU-Binutils-2.44</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:11:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GNU Binutils 2.44 was released today as the newest version of this set of binary utilities that is important to the GNU toolchain...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine will not lose war, we must help it become stronger, NATO secretary general says</title><link>https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/02/2/7496380/</link><author>/u/die_mannequin</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:09:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Void is booting on Apple ARM-powered devices</title><link>https://voidlinux.org/news/2025/02/new-images.html</link><author>/u/daemonpenguin</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:09:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Feburary 2025 Image Release: Arm64 ExtravaganzaWe’re pleased to announce that the 20250202 image set has been promoted to

Animal welfare focuses on animals’ well-being, particularly of those under human care or ownership. Protection laws aim to ensure that animals’ physical, mental, and environmental needs are met, while allowing their owners to make use of them (for food or labor, for example) without inflicting any “unnecessary suffering.”   

Advocates of animal rights, on the other hand, believe animals should be legally protected from all forms of exploitation. Many proponents say people should not be allowed to farm animals, use them in laboratories, injure or kill them. 

Both views are based on the idea that most animals are sentient beings, which can think and feel and therefore have personal interests which should be respected.

Java is the first language I learned in my career. Its structure is foundational in my early years of understanding programming concepts. After going through several other languages with very different approaches, I've widened my point of view. Today, I want to reflect on the idea of .In Java, the idea of  is tightly coupled with the concept of . Subtyping is the implementation of a  relationship. For example, the  class is a subtype of the  class. Henceforth, a  instance has all the  of a : it inherits the behaviour.\
Because of this, you can pass a  instance when a method calls for a  parameter or return a  instance when a method return type is . If you've learned Java, .Net, or anything remotely similar, that's how you see inheritance, and it becomes the new normal.\
It is .class Animal {
    void feed();
}

class Rabbit extends Animal {                     //1
}
Because a , it can When I first looked at Go, I was amazed that it does not have subtyping while still providing inheritance. Go uses duck typing:If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is.\
If a Go  implements the same functions as an interface, it  the interface.type Animal interface {
    feed()                                        //1
}

type Rabbit struct {
}

func (rabbit Rabbit) feed() {                     //2
    // feeds
}
Because a  function exists that takes a  as a parameter,  implements \
I do dislike Go for its error-handling approach, but I was of two minds about implicit implementation. On one side, I understood it was a new concept, and I tried to stay open-minded; on the other hand, I think things are always better explicit than implicit, either in software development or real life.Python is the most interesting language I know of regarding inheritance.\
Subtyping and type-based inheritance have been present in Python since its inception.class Animal:
    def feed(self):                               #1
        pass                                      #2

class Rabbit(Animal):                             #3
    pass
There are no abstract classes nor interfaces in Python, only classesBecause a , it can \
In this regard, Python works the same as Java in terms of inheritance. Python also offers duck typing, which I described as magic methods. For example, to make something , , that can return an , you only need to implement  and :class SingleValueIterable():

    done = False

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __iter__(self):                           #1
        return self

    def __next__(self):                           #1
        if self.done:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            self.done = True
            return self.value


svi = SingleValueIterable(5)
sviter = iter(svi)                                #2

for x in sviter:
    print(x)                                      #3
Create an  - Pythons knows how since we implemented the methods above\
The problem with this duck typing approach is that it works only for Python's predefined magic methods. What if you want to offer a class that a third party could inherit from implicitly?class Animal:

    def feed():
        pass


class Rabbit:

    def feed():
        pass
\
In the above snippet,  is not an , much to our chagrin. Enter PEP 544, titled Protocols: Structural subtyping (static duck typing). The PEP solves the impossibility of defining magic methods for our classes. It defines a simple  class: once you inherit from it, methods defined in the class become eligible for duck typing, hence the name - static duck typing.from typing import Protocol

class Animal(Protocol):                           #1

    def feed():                                   #2
        pass


class Rabbit:

    def feed():                                   #2
        pass


class VenusFlytrap:

    def feed():                                   #2

Because  is a , any class that defines  becomes an , for better or worseObject-oriented programming, inheritance, and subtyping may have specific meanings that don't translate into other languages, depending on the first language you learn. Java touts itself as an Object-Oriented language and offers the complete package. Go isn't an OO language, but it still offers subtyping via duck typing. Python offers both explicit and implicit inheritance but no interfaces.\
You learn a new programming language by comparing it with the one(s) you already know. Knowing a language's features is key to writing idiomatic code in your target language. Familiarize yourself with features that don't exist in your known languages: they will widen your understanding of programming as a whole.Originally published at A Java Geek on January 26th, 2025]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI systems with ‘unacceptable risk’ are now banned in the EU</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/ai-systems-with-unacceptable-risk-are-now-banned-in-the-eu/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As of Sunday in the European Union, the bloc’s regulators can ban the use of AI systems they deem to pose “unacceptable risk” or harm.

Some of them are critical, and keeping them up to date is non-negotiable. But tracking them manually? That’s a nightmare.At first, I tried the usual methods: setting up email notifications, following RSS feeds, even writing a few scripts to scrape version numbers. But each artifact lived in its own ecosystem—some on GitHub, others on DockerHub or ArtifactHub. Some had built-in notification systems, some didn’t. And worst of all, I had no .I needed a way to track everything in one place. Not just track, but also get notified in the right way. Some updates needed an email. Others were better suited for a Slack message or a webhook trigger for automation, or all of them (just to be sure ;) ).So I built —a simple tool that lets you define  (the things you care about) and attach  (the places you want updates to go). One configuration file, multiple sinks, and no more version-hunting.Right now, Veno supports GitHub, DockerHub, and ArtifactHub as sources, with notifications via Email, Webhooks, Google Chat, and Slack. A CLI version is up and running, and a web service is in the works. Eventually, I want to add scheduled tracking (daemon mode) so it runs in the background.If you're in the same boat—managing multiple software artifacts and tired of manually checking for updates—Veno might be useful for you. I’d love feedback, feature requests, and contributors! Would this be useful for your workflow? Let me know what you'd like to see in a tool like this!: I started learning Rust about 6 months ago, so I'd appreciate some feedback about idiomatic Rust and or other tips how to improve! The version checking logic is still kind of janky and the GitHub logic only supports semver currently. I am going to improve upon the version logic in future releases!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dissecting a Real-World Bitcoin Testnet Multisig Transaction</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/dissecting-a-real-world-bitcoin-testnet-multisig-transaction?source=rss</link><author>EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 13:45:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[III. Electronic Signatures, Writing Requirement, and AuthenticationAppendix A: Multisig Transaction on Bitcoin Testnet ExampleThe author selected Bitcoin, a popular virtual currency, to illustrate a multisig transaction. Bitcoin Core version 0.17.1 was used. For simplicity, we selected an already completed testnet multisig transaction and looked-up the raw transaction (“TxRaw”) data from a blockchain explorer[69]. We then decoded raw data with the Bitcoin client, filtering out the relevant input information as follows:\
The above information (emphasized in bold) tells us that the transaction utilized the multisig protocol and required the signature of two private keys out of three listed wallets. Next, we used the same raw data to extract relevant output information:\
This metadata (emphasized in bold) helps us associate the previously extracted wallet addresses from the input information to a name. The alphanumeric string after London is the last 28 characters of a digital signature that signed the message. The whole signature hash can be reproduced by signing the text with the wallet that ends with KkjJX (John Smith’s wallet). The validity of the signature can be confirmed with the Bitcoin client by plugging in the signer’s wallet address, signature hash, and message.\
With the metadata extracted from the raw transaction data, the digital signature provided by one of the parties, and the publicly available information on a blockchain explorer, we can establish with high confidence the following:Transaction id fa65bc5fa0ee39e012282701a4ce378474183a330487e839cd1b65b398d7646e was completed on 28 March 2019 at 15:46:53 UTCThe transaction amount was 0.005 BTC“A-JohnSmith-KkjJX” relates to mzV1dsMdDjtLSfRa2rPrE2oJpRtynKkjJX“C-Acme-fZN8L” relates to mpGZniUmoCemQzRbazvdgzGkmjUQ3fZN8L“R-Baker-NBSvH” relates to n2dSPmt5cv2hFNfQqoZtvRJ6bZmypNBSvHThe transaction makes reference to London.Mr. John Smith’s wallet digitally signed the embedded data.The record is unaltered given the number of confirmations, which can be seen on any blockchain explorer.Appendix B: Breakdown of BTC Stored in 2/3 Multisig Accounts[70](1) A.J.

Electronic Signatures, Writing Requirement, and AuthenticationMultisig is an exciting technology that could change how merchants resolve cross-border disputes. The multisig protocol functions similar to escrow, but a key difference is that no one party, including the arbitrator, has sole possession of the funds. In a 2/3 multisig account, at least two parties must authorize a transfer by signing data with their respective private keys. This scheme provides a more efficient and trust-less mechanism for trading. However, there is some uncertainty whether or not multisig can be recognized as an arbitral award in some jurisdictions. The New York Convention requires awards to be “duly authenticated.” In civil law systems, the authentication of signatures is traditionally performed by public authorities or notaries. Moreover, the lex arbitri may impose additional form and document legalization requirements.\
If parties select the law of England as the seat of arbitration, they are free to agree on the form of an award under Section 52(1) of the Arbitration Act 1996. Through the concept of party autonomy, parties can restrict arbitrators from following guidelines on the content of awards and authorize the issuance of an award in electronic form. The parties should explicitly opt-out of a reasoned award as provided for under some arbitration rules. In addition, names and wallet addresses should be associated with parties at the time when the arbitration agreement is made. By doing this, an expert witness is able to certify the identity of parties and authenticate electronic signatures. Under ECA 2000, Section 7(1) (a), electronic signatures are admissible as evidence and under section 7(3), any person can certify the authenticity of such signatures.\
Multisig ought to be viewed as compatible within the international arbitration legal order, where the process is defined in an arbitration agreement and the raw transaction data is the actual arbitral award in an electronic form. Much in the same way courts have been able to adapt the law regarding paper contracts to the emergence of technologies like telegram, telex, fax, and e-mail, blockchain-based applications will be another method for entering into contractual relations. The technological novelty of multisig does not justify characterizing it as a separate legal order.\
Although multisig is compatible with the aims of international arbitration, in that it could provide a fast, cost-effective, and final method for resolving disputes privately, it is unlikely it will be widely used at the present. For one, there is a steep learning curve for merchants and their legal representatives to learn how to adequately use the technology. Secondly, arbitration institutions might be reluctant or slow to modernize rules to allow for conducting arbitration by electronic means. And finally, the multisig protocol is not intuitive enough for ordinary commercial use.(1) A.J. Santos, B.A. (UTSA), J.D.

Brendan Eich in 1995 designed JavaScript to be a client side scripting language of choice for the Netscape browser, over the years it has evolved to be on the client, server and other technologies like serverless. Similarly, Docker Compose has evolved from a local development tool into a popular choice for deploying applications, even in production environments. While Docker has published guidelines for using Compose in production, one critical aspect often overlooked by users is secure secret management.In this guide, we'll explore the best practices for managing secrets in modern Docker Compose deployments and discuss common pitfalls to avoid. We'll progressively build up from basic approaches to more secure configurations.The Problem with Environment VariablesMost Docker Compose setups handle secrets in one of two ways: either by hardcoding them directly in the compose file or using a  file:While convenient, this approach has several security implications:Environment variables are accessible to all processes in a containerThey often appear in logs during debuggingThey can be exposed through application errorsThey make it difficult to maintain separation of concerns between servicesLet's demonstrate why this is problematic. With a basic Postgres container running:We can easily inspect all environment variables:We can also directly print all environment variables from within the container:This exposure of secrets through environment variables has led to numerous security incidents over the years:Although the first two examples presume an application misconfiguration and most modern web application frameworks try their best to censor secrets in error logs, this can be a pretty serious issue.Let's explore three progressively more secure approaches to managing secrets in Docker Compose.First, ensure you're running Docker Compose version 2.30.0 or later for full secrets support:Your application should also be configured to read secrets from files rather than environment variables. Here's a pattern we recommend for python, as an example:Prioritizes reading secrets from files using the  suffix conventionMaintains compatibility with environment variables as a fallbackFor a given secret  check if  environment variable containing a file path exists, if yes - read the  secret from the fileElse, read the secret from the  environment variableApproach 1: Environment Variables - Mount secrets inside your containers based on the values of host environment variablesThe following implementation uses Docker Compose's secrets feature to read environment variables from the host and mount them as files via a virtual filesystem in each of your services:This mounts secrets as read-only virtual filesystem under :Easy setup - Simply mount the values of environment variables in memory as a filesystemSecrets never written to disk - Secrets remain in memory, reducing attack surface from filesystem accessBetter isolation between services - Each service only receives the secrets provisioned to itRead-only mounting - Prevents accidental or malicious corruption of secrets by containersSecrets exposed as host environment variables - Secrets must exist as environment variables on the host system - This can be addresses by using runtime secret injection via a secret manager such as Phase.World-readable within container - Any user, user group or process within the container can read the secrets (addressed in the next section)Requires service restart for updates - Changes to secrets require restarting affected services to take effectUsing things like  on your host system to set secrets as environment can create other unwanted externalities like your secrets getting logged in your shell history. You can use the Phase CLI to to improve the overall secret management workflow by injecting secrets directly inside the docker compose process during runtime. Here's an example:Approach 2: File-Based Secrets - Mount secrets on the host system inside your containerThe following implementation uses Docker Compose's secrets feature to mount files containing secrets from the host in each of your services:Better isolation between services - Each service only receives the secrets provisioned to itDynamic secret updates without restarts - Services can read updated secrets without container restartsInherits host file permissions - Secret files maintain their permission attributes from the host systemRead-only mounting - Prevents accidental or malicious corruption of secrets by containersSecrets written to disk on the host system - Creates potential security risk from filesystem access or backupsRequires secure file management - Additional operational overhead to secure secret filesWorld-readable by default - All users/processes in container can read secrets unless explicitly restricted - Addressed in the next sectionTo make creation of secrets on the host system easier and to improve the overall secret management workflow you can use the Phase CLI. Here's an example:Controlling access to secrets supplied to your servicesNow that we have figured out how to supply secrets securely to your services, next let's take a look how at how we can better protect them once provisioned inside our containers:Docker Compose supports what they call a 'long syntax' for declaring how secrets are provisioned and controlling their access with more granularity within the respective service's containers.: The name of the secret as it exists on the platform.: The name of the file to be mounted in /run/secrets/ in the service's task container, or absolute path of the file if an alternate location is required. Defaults to source if not specified. and : The numeric UID or GID that owns the file within /run/secrets/ in the service's task containers. Default value is USER running container.: The permissions for the file to be mounted in /run/secrets/ in the service's task containers, in octal notation. The default value is world-readable permissions (mode 0444). The writable bit must be ignored if set. The executable bit may be set.You can find the  and the  of for a given image by looking at the Dockerfile or if it's your own image add one.Here's a postgresql example:Restricts secret access to specific users/groupsPrevents other users from reading secretsMaintains write protectionYou can verify the permissions:For more information on the Docker Compose secrets long syntax, please see the Docker docsWhile this is a good start for your docker compose secrets, below are some of the things that you should most consider when dealing with informational fissile materials like secrets:Keep secrets away from source code, container files and images. Ivory and ebony, AC/AD and secrets and source code and container images; never the two shall meet.Control access to secrets and keep them in sync and up to date with the rest of your team and deployments securely. Please do not add secrets to your git repository, drop your .env files over Slack or add them to your Notion docs as part of getting started with a project.Don't reuse secrets across different environments. Your production database password should never be the same as the  that you are using for local development. Compromise of one will mean de-facto compromise of all.Encrypt secrets at all times, whether they are in flight over a network making they way to your production deployment or waiting in a database patiently to be pulled. "Dance like no one is watching, but encrypt like everyone is" - Werner Vogels, Chief Technical Officer Amazon.Keep track of all changes and actions over your secrets. It's 4:30 in the morning, do you know where your secrets are? Keep tabs on the who, what, when, and where so you can infer the  if and when there is an incident. Given the outsized number of breaches that occur due to a secret compromise, you will need those audit logs during an investigation.Some or all of these points may seem obvious to most of you reading this, but what may not be as obvious is how tricky and tedious it can be to follow security best practices without losing development velocity. Consider using open-source secrets management platform like Phase which can help streamline the process. We are a bit biased plugging our own solution, but we think you'll find it useful.Docker Compose's secret management capabilities have matured significantly, offering features typically found in larger container orchestration systems. While there are still some areas of improvements and limitations around permission enforcement (see docker/compose#12362), the available options provide a solid foundation for securing secrets in both development and smaller production environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After &apos;Copilot Price Hike&apos; for Microsoft 365, It&apos;s Ending Its Free VPN</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/02/0357206/after-copilot-price-hike-for-microsoft-365-its-ending-its-free-vpn?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 12:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2023, Microsoft began including a free VPN feature in its "Microsoft Defender" security app for all Microsoft 365 subscribers ("Personal" and "Family"). Originally Microsoft had "called it a privacy protection feature," writes the blog Windows Central, "designed to let you access sensitive data on the web via a VPN tunnel." But....

Unfortunately, Microsoft has now announced that it's killing the feature later this month, only a couple of years after it first debuted... 

To add insult to injury, this announcement comes just days after Microsoft increased subscription prices across the board. Both Personal and Family subscriptions went up by three dollars a month, which the company says is the first price hike Microsoft 365 has seen in over a decade. The increased price does now include Microsoft 365 Copilot, which adds AI features to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and others. 

However, it also comes with the removal of the free VPN in Microsoft Defender, which I've found to be much more useful so far.

Deutschland müsse „mehr ausgeben und mehr produzieren“, sagte Rutte der „Bild am Sonntag“. Deutschland müsse den Weg, den es eingeschlagen hat, „konsequent weitergehen“, sowohl in Europa als auch in der Ukraine.Deutschland habe seit dem Beginn des russischen Krieges in der Ukraine „viel richtig gemacht“, betonte der Nato-Chef. „Aber: Angesichts der Größe der deutschen Wirtschaft wollen wir natürlich, dass sie noch viel mehr tun.“ Rutte begründete die Forderung unter anderem mit der Bedrohung durch Russland. „Ich sage es Ihnen ganz deutlich: Wir müssen uns auf Krieg vorbereiten. Das ist der beste Weg, um Krieg zu vermeiden.“ Europa dürfe gegenüber Russland „keine Schwäche zeigen“. „Sonst könnte Russland etwas versuchen. Und zwar so, wie sie es in der Ukraine getan haben.“Gefahren drohen aber aus Ruttes Sicht nicht nur aus Russland. Auch die Chinesen bauten ihre militärischen Fähigkeiten „enorm aus“.Der Nato-Bündnis-Chef kündigte überdies an, dass die künftige Quote für Verteidigungsausgaben künftig weit über zwei Prozent liegen werde. Mehr als zwei Drittel der Nato-Partner würden mittlerweile mehr als zwei Prozent für die Rüstung ausgeben. Dies sei auch US-Präsident Donald Trump zu verdanken.Die Bündnispartner würden die genauen Bemessungsdetails in den kommenden Monaten entscheiden, sagte Rutte mit Blick auf den nächsten Nato-Gipfel im niederländischen Den Haag im Juni. „Ich kann Ihnen aber eins versichern: Es wird viel, viel, viel mehr sein als zwei Prozent.“Bei dem Gipfel erwarten Diplomaten ein erbittertes Feilschen um eine höhere Zielmarke von zunächst drei oder 3,5 Prozent. In diesem Zusammenhang rief Rutte die Bündnispartner zum stärkeren Zusammenhalt auf. „Die Nato muss als Bündnis zusammenhalten. Aber die Last muss zwischen Europa, Kanada und den USA fair verteilt werden. Damit die Amerikaner nicht zu viel zahlen und wir nicht zu wenig.“Trump hatte den Europäern mit dem Ende des Nato-Beistandspakts gedroht, sollten sie nicht genug in ihre Verteidigung investieren. Er drängt die Nato-Verbündeten zu höheren Verteidigungsausgaben und fordert von jedem Mitgliedsland Ausgaben in Höhe von fünf Prozent des Bruttoinlandprodukts (BIP). Bisher sieht die Allianz Ausgaben von mindestens zwei Prozent vor. Deutschland erfüllt die Quote knapp, sieben EU-Länder verfehlen sie, darunter Italien, Spanien, Portugal und Belgien.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can Multisig Arbitration be Seen as an Autonomous Legal Order?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/can-multisig-arbitration-be-seen-as-an-autonomous-legal-order?source=rss</link><author>EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 12:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[III. Electronic Signatures, Writing Requirement, and AuthenticationIV. CAN MULTISIG ARBITRATION BE SEEN AS AN AUTONOMOUS LEGAL ORDER? has argued that the Bitcoin multisig process is not compatible with any of the traditional narratives of international arbitration, because it offers a level of privacy and enforcement solely depends on the mechanical operation of the protocol without the need for cooperation with national legal systems[49]. Transactions can take place between anonymous users who do not disclose their identity or geographical location[50]. Bitcoin was designed as a reaction to perceived inadequacies of the traditional banking system and is a rejection of a states’ exclusive authority over money[51]. Similar to how lex  developed within a community of merchants, Bitcoin users seek selfregulation and stateless mechanisms for resolving disputes[52].  asserts having the ability to enforce norms is a key indicator of an autonomous legal order, so the multisig process must be regarded as an a distinctive system of dispute resolution53. However, this view is not supported by empirical evidence.\
Bitcoin provides very little, to no, privacy protection. It is possible to link IP addresses to Bitcoin transactions through network analysis. When a user initiates a Bitcoin client, it sends out a message containing the user’s IP address information to other nodes. The software then downloads a list of known peers from other users. This makes it possible to map out IP addresses to Bitcoin addresses[54]. In a study of relay patterns, several hundred high-confidence (>90%) Bitcoin address-to-IP pairings were discovered[55]. In another study, researchers were able to link numerous users to IP addresses, the vast majority of which had probabilities above 0.9, with the average value of pairings at 95.52%[56]. Even with Tor, an anonymizing overlay network, Bitcoin addresses could be linked retroactively with publicly available information. In a case study that crawled thousands of Tor hidden services, social media accounts, and forums, researchers were able to link a number of unique users to Tor hidden services[57]. For some users, they were able to discover personally identifiable information, such as name, gender, age, and location[58]. The researchers concluded that Bitcoin addresses should always be assumed to be compromised as it could be used to de-anonymize users[59]. Moreover, courts have the power to order third party service providers to disclose information about users. Know-yourcustomer compliant exchanges and custodial wallet providers could be compelled under a pre-action Norwich Pharmacal Order to disclose names, emails, postal addresses, and IP addresses of registered users[60]. In a case from Ireland, a court noted when ordering an internet service provider to disclose information about their subscribers “that whether the right to confidentiality arises by statute or by contract or at common law, it cannot be relied on by a wrongdoer or a person against whom there is evidence of wrongdoing to protect his or her identity… right to privacy or confidentiality of identity must give way where there is prima facie evidence of wrongdoing[61].” Thus, with the development of standardized Bitcoin investigative tools that can link transactions to geographical locations and courts’ inherent power to order the disclosure of information from service providers, information about Bitcoin users can be discovered and they are not anonymous.\
Furthermore, Bitcoin users are not purely interested in self-regulation and stateless mechanisms. Users’ views range the whole political spectrum. According to a State of Blockchain Report, it was reported that 35% of Bitcoin supporters are Socialist or Liberal, 46% Conservative or Libertarian, while only a small minority, 9%, identified as “Anarcho-Capitalist,” a political philosophy that advocates for the elimination of the state[62]. In another survey of blockchain developers, it was found that the majority of respondents indicated they are primarily motivated by money, passion for coding, attraction to the blockchain technology, learning, and community recognition[63]. Bitcoin users have a wide array of views and, in general, do embrace the Westphalian model.\
And lastly, Bitcoin multisig cannot be viewed as a customary norm in lex mercatoria. To be recognized as a norm, the practice must persist over a substantial period of time, reflect trade habits and market usages, be universal, be extrinsic to the legal system, and be of utilitarian benefit for a merchant community[64]. The BIP-11 M-of-N Standard Transactions proposal was accepted December 13, 2011 and BIP-16 Pay to Script Hash, which enabled multisig scripting, was accepted April 1, 2012[65]. The first multisig wallet service was launched in August 2013[66]. According to statistics of 2/3 multisig account usage, the number of deposited funds picked up in late 2015, but has since leveled off after the 2017 Bitcoin “tulip bubble,” see Appendix B. As it can be seen multisig is a relatively recent technology that does not have wide usage over a substantial period of time, so customs within the community cannot be elevated to the level of . Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that Bitcoin multisig is currently being used by a concrete and identifiable merchant community.\
Given these points, multisig ought not be seen as a distinctive legal order. It would be more advantageous to bring the multisig process under the purview of international commercial arbitration law. International arbitration has a wealth of rules and case law for arbitrators to draw from. Awards can be recognized by numerous national legal systems under the New York Convention[67] and arbitrators, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, are afforded immunity from liability under national laws and arbitration rules[68].(1) A.J.

Despite a reversal on life-saving aid, particularly for HIV treatments, it remains unclear what will happen after the review. Questions remain about what else will be funded and who exactly will receive it. 
The US is the world's largest single aid donor and a key provider of humanitarian assistance to Africa. So a freeze or reduction in aid could have devastating consequences for millions, and put lives at risk.
Last year, the United States provided nearly $7 billion in humanitarian aid to sub-Saharan Africa, according to USAID. This funding covered a wide range of support, including HIV prevention, malaria treatment, agricultural assistance, and initiatives to combat the effects of climate change.
In 2024, UN agencies received the largest share of funding, totaling over $3 billion, followed closely by US government bodies and US-affiliated NGOs.

Relying on the backbone of volunteers, vulnerabilities now make it a prime target for cyberattacks by both malicious hackers and state actors. The close call with the xz Utils backdoor attack highlights just how fragile open source security can be. With open source tools being crucial for both private companies and governments, greater investment from the private sector and public sectors will be required.\
Much of the internet’s crowdsourced code is vulnerable to infiltration by bad actors and nation-states. Open source software is at the “heart of the internet,” it is largely maintained by a handful of volunteers and that makes it a major security risk for corporations and governments alike, The Economist reported. Open source software is commonly deployed across digital infrastructure because of its low cost. That infrastructure, which is embedded across the digital world, is under attack by various enemy nation-states.\
Martin Woodward, VP of developer relations at GitHub previously said, “Open source software is the foundation of 99% of the world’s software.” Around 97% of applications utilize open source code, with 90% of companies incorporating or using it in some capacity.What the last year has shown in open source securityThe xz Utils incident was a chilling example of what’s at stake. On March 29, 2024, Andres Freund, a software engineer at Microsoft, “inadvertently found a backdoor hidden in a piece of software that is part of the Linux operating system.” This backdoor came from the release tarballs for xz Utils, which were tampered with, and allowed unauthorized access to systems using the affected versions. The source code that was compromised was of the xz Utils open source data compression utility in Linux systems. The New York Times wrote that the engineer prevented a “potentially historic cyberattack.”\
Since xz Utils is open source software, its code is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view the changes made. However, this openness was exploited in a particularly sneaky manner: the attack targeted only the code in the release tarballs (compressed archive file for the version of a software release), leaving the main branch of the repository untouched. This clever tactic made the compromise harder to detect. Without the vigilance of a developer and a stroke of luck, the attack could have caused massive harm, breaching countless systems worldwide.\
A developer named Jia Tan began making helpful code contributions to the project and slowly earning trust. Then over time, the bad actor smuggled in malware. One of the most surprising elements of the xz Utils backdoor attack was how the malicious code was introduced through seemingly harmless git commits. Instead of altering the xz Utils source code directly, the malware was concealed as x86_64 object code within binary test files, disguised as unit tests for edge cases in XZ decompression. Russia’s foreign intelligence service, SVR, suspected to be behind the attacks, is the same intelligence service behind the SolarWinds attack.\
This incident is not isolated. Open source projects are attractive targets for state actors because the code is public. While this openness is great for collaboration, it also gives attackers easy access to study the code and its updates. Open source plays a vital role in global infrastructure; A report from Lineaje in 2023 revealed that 70% of all software today is open source and that 82% of open source software components are “inherently risky.” Unfortunately, its ubiquitous use makes its vulnerabilities even more dangerous.\
Reports from Lineaje and others highlight the risks: 82% of open source components are considered risky due to poor maintenance, outdated code, or security flaws. Many of these projects are run by small teams or individual volunteers with limited resources, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.How AI will play a greater roleAdding to these risks is the rise of large language models (LLMs) While LLMs help developers with tasks like debugging or automating workflows, they can also be misused. Attackers can use LLMs to quickly analyze open source code for vulnerabilities, making it easier to find exploitable flaws. These AI tools can also craft convincing phishing messages or fake contributions to open source projects, making it harder to spot bad actors. The ability of LLMs to mimic human interaction increases the chances of malicious code slipping through unnoticed through phishing and other attack vectors that can be automated.\
Despite the risks, LLMs also offer opportunities to improve open source security. But there is a balance to be had since it could be cost prohibitive, as companies are unlikely to invest into running LLM based analyzers on open source code with no budget. For example, AI systems could flag suspicious changes in a codebase or detect unusual patterns in contributor behavior. Open source LLMs also “benefit from the fast-growing base of developer communities pushing their boundaries and scaling daily to solve complex cybersecurity challenges.”\
However, the same technology that strengthens defenses can also be weaponized. Deploying an open source LLM on a server or in a cloud environment introduces the risk of unauthorized access to the model or the sensitive data it handles, if there are not proper security controls in place. Malicious actors can tamper with training data or the model itself, injecting harmful code or biases that result in misleading or malicious content. Additionally, improperly secured LLMs may leak sensitive information, either through generated text or attacks targeting the model’s architecture.\
What was once accomplished with a single repository using tools like xz Utils could soon be scaled across hundreds by a single individual leveraging advanced GenAI technologies over the next few years—and this shift has likely already begun. The barrier to entry has dropped dramatically, moving from requiring nation-state-level resources or extreme dedication to something that can now be mass-produced. It’s entirely plausible that in the coming years, the majority of small or minor updates to repositories will be generated by GenAI.\
While meaningful, high-quality development contributions remain a different challenge, the role of maintainers may shift as well. Instead of being skilled developers actively contributing code, maintainers might increasingly be those who excel at managing grunt work and presenting an image of helpfulness, leaving the more complex or innovative tasks to a smaller group of dedicated developers.Traditional phishing attacks focus on obtaining a company’s internal directory and targeting key individuals—or those they trust. With NPM’s extensive dependency ecosystem, which is publicly accessible, attackers have a different angle. They can identify the small number of maintainers for a given package, assess the backlog of issues, and use that information to deploy bots that appear helpful by contributing fixes or offering assistance. This creates an avenue for gaining trust and embedding themselves within the development process.\
The best fake identities are crafted with real-world data, enriched over time through social media posts, academic records, and more. A convincing fake ID includes a detailed backstory, complete with photos, connections, and an online presence. GenAI simplifies the creation of these identities, while also enhancing them by simulating coding activity on platforms like GitHub.\
Many early contributions to open source projects are small and easy to verify—like fixing typos in comments or updating dependencies. These activities are ideal for attackers using LLMs, as they can be automated at scale. This enables the creation of hundreds of fake identities, each with LinkedIn profiles, social media accounts, and GitHub histories containing thousands of minor but legitimate contributions.\
These identities can participate in multiple projects, potentially overlapping, and build a track record of helpfulness. Over time, a malicious actor might use one of these identities to submit more critical contributions. Even these contributions may initially appear valid and beneficial. In coordinated efforts, such as those by nation-states or hacker collectives, one identity could bolster the credibility of another, reinforcing a narrative or gaining influence.\
We’ve already seen examples like the xz utils incident, where multiple identities were used to manipulate trust. When the attack was exposed, those identities were discarded. In manual operations, losing such assets would be costly. However, with GenAI, generating new identities comes at minimal expense, significantly lowering the stakes for attackers.Supply chain attacks will growA recent software supply chain attack targeted the popular @solana/web3.js npm library, which is widely used for building Solana-based applications, compromising versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7 with malicious code to steal users’ private keys and drain cryptocurrency wallets. The attack exploited a phishing campaign that allowed threat actors to gain publish-access and inject a backdoor function, exfiltrating private keys via legitimate-looking Cloudflare headers. The affected versions have been removed, and users are urged to update to version 1.95.8 and consider rotating their keys to mitigate risks.\
Software supply chain attacks are expected to increase in 2025 due to the growing reliance on open source libraries and the rise of sophisticated attack methods like phishing and social engineering. According to a study by Synopsys, vulnerabilities in open source software are steadily increasing. Additionally, the increased integration of open source tools in enterprise systems provides attackers with a higher return on investment, making such breaches even more attractive to both cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors.Influence of state actors and targeting of volunteersThe xz Utils incident, much like the SolarWinds attack, serves as a wake-up call, highlighting the need for greater investment and collaboration between the public and private sectors to secure open source software and preserve its value as a digital public good. Companies that benefit from open source tools need to step up and support these projects. This support can include funding, providing developer time, or offering security expertise. Open source projects also need better governance, such as stricter code review processes and shared responsibility for updates. Faster patching of vulnerabilities is another priority, as delays leave systems exposed to attacks for longer periods.\
State actors remain one of the biggest threats. Open source software offers them a low-cost, high-reward target for espionage, sabotage, and disruption. The SolarWinds attack, although involving proprietary software, is a prime example of how damaging these supply chain breaches can be.\
Attackers will likely continue to target individual maintainers more frequently, using advanced social engineering tactics to compromise projects. AI tools will continue to enhance both the attackers’ and defenders’ capabilities, creating a race to stay ahead of new threats. Governments are also likely to get more involved, helping promote public-private partnerships to improve security across the wider ecosystem. At the same time, stricter regulations may be introduced, pushing companies to take more responsibility for the open source components they use.\
When it comes to the SolarWinds incident, whether it has faded from memory depends on the perspective. While public attention may have shifted, government officials and cybersecurity experts remain focused on addressing the lessons learned. Much of the ongoing work in software supply chain security, such as initiatives by the OpenSSF (like SLSA and GUAC), is a direct response to the need for stronger defenses, driven by agencies like CISA, but progress has been slow, and not all organizations have adopted these protections. The federal government itself is one of the largest consumers of open source software and will continue to increase its involvement in the space.\
While these efforts continue behind the scenes, the incident’s impact may not have fully resonated with the general public, especially among independent or hobbyist software developers who may not fully grasp the broader implications.Ultimately, as expert Michal Zalewski noted, “The bottom line is that we have untold trillions of dollars riding on top of code developed by hobbyists.” This underscores the possibility that other backdoors may still be lurking, undiscovered, within the critical software that forms the backbone of the internet.\
While identifying vulnerabilities is a concern, the larger issue lies in the erosion of trust within open source ecosystems. Open source thrives on the contributions of faceless developers who work in good faith, often without direct interaction or verification of identity. GenAI undermines this foundation by making it feasible for many of those faceless contributors to be entirely fabricated.\
Phishing attacks are already dangerous because they exploit trust rather than breaking through technical defenses—they trick individuals into executing malicious code in a trusted environment. GenAI amplifies this risk by enabling attackers to embed malicious code into trusted open source packages under the guise of legitimate contributions.\
This will likely spark a race between malicious actors using GenAI to infiltrate projects and defensive tools leveraging GenAI to detect and counter vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. The question then becomes whether trust in open source can survive in a world where contributors may increasingly be indistinguishable from AI-driven imposters.\
As we enter 2025, open source software is at a critical point. The threats are becoming more sophisticated, driven by state actors, the misuse of AI tools like LLMs, and a focus on supply chain interference to inflict maximum damage. However, with proactive measures, greater investment, and shared responsibility, it’s possible to create a future where open source continues to thrive as a force for innovation and progress, rather than a vulnerability waiting to be exploited.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Does Multisig Authentication Differ from Traditional Arbitration?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-does-multisig-authentication-differ-from-traditional-arbitration?source=rss</link><author>EScholar: Electronic Academic Papers for Scholars</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 11:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[III. Electronic Signatures, Writing Requirement, and AuthenticationC. COULD A MULTISIG E-AWARD BE DULY AUTHENTICATED?Before considering the issue of authentication, it should be pointed out that a multisig e-award is different from a traditional paper award in that it is self-enforcing. Once the multisig signature threshold has been met and the transaction is broadcast to the network, the funds are released to the recipient. Enforcement of a mutlisig award is not necessarily an issue, but whether the act of releasing funds puts an end, in whole, or in part, a dispute and if the resulting raw transaction data could be recognized as an award.\
This is important because if multisig is not capable of being recognized, then a multisig transaction could be challenged in any court with competent jurisdiction and an arbitrator's finding reversed. Although technically the multisig transaction is non-reversible at the code level, a court could order compensation to be paid notwithstanding the execution of the transaction on a blockchain. When a participant deposit an asset into a multisig account, there is an understanding that the asset will not be transferred unless certain conditions are met, namely the requirement of M-of-N signatures and the occurrence of an event or the performance of an obligation. The arbitrator makes a determination if the conditions have been satisfied and releases the funds by signing a transaction with his or her private key. As such, multisig can be viewed as a separate and distinct contract from the underlying agreement between the participants. For instance, in a sale of goods agreement, if no goods or sub-standard goods are delivered, the buyer could sue the seller for breach even if a third party releases funds from a multisig account. The decision of the arbitrator, ipso facto, does not have  effect and is somewhat analogous to a decision of a bank releasing funds under a letter of credit.\
In addition, if the multisig process is not seen as a form of international commercial arbitration and the arbitrator fails to perform the decision-making function to the level expected of a technologically-savvy prudent adjudicator, he or she may face unlimited personal liability. The arbitrator owes concurrent contractual, non contractual, and equitable duties towards multisig ‐ participants. So, it is vital for a multisig transaction to be recognizable as a final and binding award.\
Under Article IV(a) the New York Convention, a party applying for recognition must supply a “duly authenticated original award.” The Convention does not define the meaning of authentication, but commentators are in general agreement that it can be defined as the process of confirming the authenticity of arbitrators’ signatures[38]. The law applicable to issues related to authentication can either be the  or the law of where recognition is sought[39]. According to the , the drafting committee preferred to give the court where recognition is sought more flexibility in determining the governing law than the Geneva Convention of 1927, which only pointed to [40]. In common law jurisdictions, the act of confirming the authenticity of a signature is viewed as an evidentiary matter. It does not require to be in any particular form and in the interest of justice and efficient conduct of court business, a simple straightforward method is usually preferred[41]. The act can be performed by public officials, lawyers, witnesses, or arbitration institutions[42]. On the other hand, in most civil law jurisdictions, the concept of authenticity is viewed more narrowly and traditionally require a competent public authority or a notary public to verify the truthfulness of documents[43].\
According to  and , Article IV should be read in conjunction with Article III and if the country of where the award was made permits the issuance of awards in electronic form, there should be no barrier to accepting the award as duly authenticated[44].  notes that although an indefinitely reproducible electronic document cannot be seen as “original,” in relation to electronic data, it can be an authentic copy, where the authorship of the data can be reliably proven[45]. However, Otto cautions against electronic awards as there is no unanimous view of authentication and some countries have taken a strict view[46]. There is a risk if recognition is sought in a civil law jurisdiction, the multisig transaction may not be viewed as final and binding.\
If we apply the law of England as the , under Section 7(3) of the ECA 2000, “any person” can certify an electronic signature with a statement confirming the authenticity. Section 7, Part III (15)(2)(a), further provides that the term “authentication” relates to whether an electronic communication or data: (i) comes from a particular person or other source; (ii) is accurately timed and dated; (iii) is intended to have legal effect.\
In the case of the example in Appendix A, a signature hash can be linked to a particular signer and any alteration to raw transaction data can be detectable. The time and date is part of the data and the intent for the electronic signature to have legal effect can be established by referring to the arbitration agreement and the subsequent conduct of the parties[47]. An expert witness could certify the authenticity of the electronic signatures by checking the embedded metadata. Alternatively, an arbitrator has the option to self-certify as to the authenticity of the transaction. This method of authentication is consistent with the interest of having a pragmatic, flexible, non-formalistic, arbitration-friendly approach to the interpretation of Article IV[48].(1) A.J.

Then TypeScript. TypeScript caught many bugs which I've experienced with JS, such as spending 2 hours debugging because I accidentally wrote "false" instead of false. TypeScript caught these bugs. I was amazed by how "powerful" its type system isThen I tried Rust. I've been programming in Rust for about 2 months now. Rust's type system to TypeScript is like TypeScript's type system to JavaScript. I wouldn't have believed these worlds before Rust. Having a type system which actually co-exists with your code is really, really delightful.When a value claims to have some type in TypeScript, you can't be sure that it actually is that type. Any of the 100s of function calls used to derive this value may have used an  assertion, and if this assertion is wrong then the type is invalid. If an invalid type is somewhere deep enough it can spread like the plague, but you won't know.TypeScript's type inference compared to Rust's is weaker. This means there are often situations where you're forced to use an  assertion. And that's pretty bad, because now you've introduced an extra chance for incorrect types to be introduces and proliferate in your codeWhen people said "haha using JavaScript on the backend", I thought TypeScript is the solution. But if you want to be certain your program will work correctly you'll have to be extra careful when using TypeScript, values can claim to be some type while not actually being that type.In some sense, using an  assertion is similar to using  in Rust. You're making a promise that your program upholds some invariants that the compiler can't infer itself. And the Rust community places a lot of importance on properly documenting why certain invariants are upheld for  blocks. But  are not treated nearly the same, they're often just used without a second thought. And that's a problemHaving a strong type system is one of the most important factors about a language, to me at least. Type systems allow you to express the purpose of your program in a way that your code never will.I am super grateful to Rust and Haskell for opening my eyes on type systems. I'm also super grateful for all the work done on the TypeScript compiler. While it's far from perfect, I understand it's the way it is and has to be that way. There's not much TS can do since it compiles to the same old JavaScript. TypeScript it is an essential layer of protection on top of your JavaScript. But I'm really looking forward to a future where we don't need to use TypeScript anymore, and Rust frameworks such as Dioxus can become popular like Next.js (I can dream...)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unexpected Benefits of Building Your Own Tools</title><link>https://tiniuc.com/make-more-tools/</link><author>/u/tiniucIx</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 10:41:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I've been thinking a lot about some of the tools I've made, and I have found an insight from game development that I think can apply to the software engineering industry as a whole.The origin of the insightI'm working on a hacking simulator, Botnet of Ares and part of the work involves designing and balancing the parameters for the various Exploits that the player can use. For context, these Exploits are kind of equivalent to items in an Role-Playing Game. They have stats similar to "Damage", "Attack Speed", "Mana Cost", except framed in the context of a computer thread performing work - so the rough equivalents in my game would be "Machine Speed", "Loss Wait Time" & the various "Per Machine" costs, respectively.This used to be done in a spreadsheet, and the process involved copy-pasting ~10 fields every time I wanted to move something into or out of the game.At some point I realized that I am spending an eternity staring at spreadsheets and it was just no fun for this sort of task. Furthermore, I was wasting a lot of time copy-pasting things into Godot (the game engine I am using), play-testing, noticing something is wrong, going back to the spreadsheet, editing, copy-pasting again etc. etc. etc.So I decided to implement my own editor which can save & load directly using the Godot  format. It's super quick & dirty & not optimized at all, but it's already made the process of creating content for the game much faster.All this is is a little editor that lets me input stats for the various exploits, shows a bit of info on the right side about its balance, and then outputs a scene file that can be loaded directly into the game.What this has made me realize is that speeding up part of a workflow can provide value far beyond the mere time savings: it also unlocks new ways of working that were not possible before. For example, with the Exploit Editor I can go over entire lines of devices and balance them in relation to each other. This used to be incredibly tedious to do with the spreadsheet because of all the tedious copy-pasting required to import from the editor. But now, I can edit dozens of scenes and remain in a state of flow throughout.The editor has made the creation of these Exploits at least an order of magnitude faster, and has also increased the quality of content I can make by letting me iterate much faster. Not too shabby for ~4 hours of work!Iteration velocity: the insight from game developmentI was motivated to build the Exploit Editor for Botnet of Ares thanks to a common principle in game development: to design a good game, you must iterate through as many versions of the game as you can, keeping the parts that are fun, getting rid of the ones that are not & improving the game at any step. Essentially, the more iterations of the design you can make, the higher quality your game will be - limited, of course, by your budget.I built the Exploit Editor because I could not iterate through various item designs quickly enough, and as a result I now have many more items in the game, and they are all higher quality than they would be without this tool.This is a well-known principle in the games development industry - in bigger studios there is often a team dedicated to building & supporting tools & editors for designers & other folks to use. And I think this principle has applications far beyond game development.Application from work - the chilictl utilityDuring my day job I have worked on an utility called "chilictl." It allows one to list embedded devices connected to the PC, see basic information about them & flash a new application.$ ./chilictl list

All of these things are things you could already do in other ways before the tool was created. For example, you could find the serial number by connecting to the USB debug API & looking for the right . Or you could flash devices by digging through your drawer, getting your JLink programmer out, making sure the flimsy 10-pin JTAG cable hasn't snapped a wire internally like the other 5 you've had to throw out this year, opening the correct programming utility & then finally flashing.You can see where I'm going with this. A single utility was created that removes 90% of the tedium. The tool would have been worth it for this reason alone, but now my colleagues have incorporated it in countless workflows. Here are some examples:automated Hardware-In-The-Loop nightly test harness that notifies people whenever someone's  broken prodmodifying serial numbers & security credentials en masse, for tests & development work that requires devices with different identities.unit tests for the parts of the code that were prone to bugs & hard to keep an eye on until nowtests and experiments involving different binaries across dozens of devicessimply programming the hardware you're working on without having to fiddle with wiresThe crucial insight is that none of these applications would have been obvious without being able to flash devices an order of magnitude faster. And  was not designed to be built into these! All of these applications were unlocked once we had experience with the new utility.One of the highest returns on investment I've had on workflow automation was the script below. It rebuilds an OpenWRT image from scratch with updated dependencies.#!/bin/sh
./scripts/feeds update -a
./scripts/feeds install -a
make clean
make -j12
# Write logs to file, for debugging
#make -j12 V=sc -k 2>&1 | tee build_log.txt
cmatrix -b
Ive lost count of how many times I ran  without first updating the feed I was working on! The call to  at the end plays a Matrix inspired stream of green characters the moment the build finishes. This solves the problem of starting the build, working on something else & not noticing that the build has completed even when it was a rather high priority task!Lets say this script took five minutes to write. If it saves one rebuild, it has already paid for itself four times over. It has saved  more time since. Thanks to this script, debugging certain things that used to take a whole day now can be done in just a few hours.I think many people could benefit from creating more tools for their own needs. Think of the fraction of your work that you hate the most, and see if there's any way you can remove some of the tedium from it. Even a little bit of automation helps a lot if you are automating a common frustrating task.And often, you will find that these tools will let you work in new and surprising ways. Ways in which would not have been obvious had you not built the tool in the first place. This leads not just to building your application faster, but building a higher quality application as well thanks to the benefits of iterative development. As the saying goes, quantity has a quality all its own.

We really appreciate you being a part of our SanDisk® family.I understand that you wish to know more about the SanDisk® High Endurance video monitoring card, as such please allow me to inform you that all our SanDisk® memory cards uses Multi level cell technology (MLC) flash. However, the read/write cycles for the flash memory is not published nor documented only the read and write speed in published as such they are 100 MB/S & 40 MB/s. The 64 GB card can record Full HD video up to 10,000 hours. To know more about the card you may refer to the link below:Best regards,
Allan B.
SanDisk® Global Customer CareI’ll give them a silver star that says “You Tried” at least.While (micro)SD cards feel like a solid monolithic piece of technology, they’re made up of multiple different chips, each performing a different role. A basic SD card will have a controller that manages the NAND Flash chips and communicates with the host (PC, camera, etc.), and the NAND Flash itself (made up of 1 or more Flash dies). Bunnie Huang’s blog, Bunnie Studios, has an excellent article on the internals of SD cards, including counterfeits and how they’re made – check it out here.Block diagram of a typical SD card.MicroSD cards often (but not always!) include test pads, used to program/test the NAND Flash during manufacture. These can be exploited in the case of data recovery, or to reuse microSD cards that have a defective controller or firmware by turning the card into a piece of raw NAND Flash – check out Gough Lui’s adventures here. Note that there is no set standard for these test pads (even for the same manufacturer!), but there are common patterns for some manufacturers like SanDisk that make reverse-engineering easier.microSD cards fall into a category of “monolithic” Flash devices, as they combine a controller and raw NAND Flash memory into a single, inseparable package. Many manufacturers break out the Flash’s data bus onto hidden (and nearly completely undocumented) test pads, which some other memory card and USB drive manufacturers take advantage of to make cheap storage products using failed parts; the controller can simply be electrically disabled and the Flash is then used as if it were a regular chip.In the case of SanDisk cards, there is very limited information on their cards’ test pad pinouts. Each generation has slight differences, but the layout is mostly the same. CORRECTION (July 22, 2020):Upon further review, I might have accidentally created a discrepancy between the leaked pinouts online, versus my own documentation in terms of power polarity; see the “Test Pad Pinout” section.My card (and many of their higher-end cards – that is, not their Ultra lineup) features test pads that aren’t covered by solder mask, but are instead covered by some sort of screen-printed epoxy with a laser-etched serial number on top. With a bit of heat and some scraping, I was able to remove the (very brittle) coating on top of the test pads; this also removed the serial number which I believe is an anti-tamper measure by SanDisk.After cleaning off any last traces of the epoxy coating, I was greeted with the familiar SanDisk test pad layout, plus a few extra on the bottom.The breakout board is relatively simple in concept: for each test pad, bring out a wire that goes to a bigger test point for easier access, and wire up the normal SD bus to an SD connector to let the controller do its work with twiddling the NAND Flash bus. Given how small each test pad is (and how many), things get a bit… messy.I started by using double-side foam adhesive tape to secure the SD card to a piece of perfboard. I then tinned all of the pads and soldered a small 1uF ceramic capacitor across the card’s power (Vcc) and ground (GND) test pads. Using 40-gauge (0.1 mm, or 4-thousandths of an inch!) magnet wire, I mapped each test pad to its corresponding machine-pin socket on the perfboard. Including the extra test pads, that’s a total of 28 tiny wires!For the SD connector side of things, I used a flex cable for the XTC 2 Clip (a tool used to service HTC Android devices), as it acted as a flexible “remote SD card” and broke out the signals to a small ribbon cable. I encased the flex cable with copper tape to act as a shield against electrical noise and to provide physical reinforcement, and soldered the tape to the outer pads on the perfboard for reinforcement. The ribbon cable end was then tinned and each SD card’s pin was wired up with magnet wire. The power lines were then broken out to an LED and resistor to indicate when the card was receiving power.With all of the test pads broken out to an array of test pins, it was time to make sense of what pins are responsible for accessing the NAND Flash inside the card.Diagram of the test pads on SanDisk’s High Endurance microSD card. (click to enlarge)The overall test pad pinout was the same for other microSD cards from SanDiskCORRECTION (July 22, 2020):I might actually have just gotten my own documentation mixed up in terms of the power and ground test pads. Regardless, one should always be careful to ensure the correct power polarity is sent to a device.I used my DSLogic Plus logic analyzer to analyze the signals on all of the pins. Since the data pinout was previously discovered, the hard part of figuring out what each line represented (data bus, control, address, command, write-protect, ready/busy status) was already done for me. However, not all of the lines were immediately evident as the pinouts I found online only included the bare minimum of lines to make the NAND Flash accessible, with one exception being a control line that places the controller into a reset state and releases its control of the data lines (this will be important later on).By sniffing the data bus at the DSLogic’s maximum speed (and using its 32 MB onboard buffer RAM), I was able to get a clear snapshot of the commands being sent to the NAND Flash from the controller during initialization.Bus Sniffing & NAND I/O 101 (writing commands, address, reading data)In particular, I was looking for two commands: RESET (0xFF), and READ ID (0x90). When looking for a command sequence, it’s important to know how and when the data and control lines change. I will try to explain it step-by-step, but if you’re interested there is an introductory white paper by Micron that explains all of the fundamentals of NAND Flash with much more information about how NAND Flash works.When a RESET command is sent to the NAND Flash, first the /CE (Chip Select, Active Low) line is pulled low. Then the CLE (Command Latch Enable) line is pulled high; the data bus is set to its intended value of 0xFF (all binary ones); then the /WE (Write Enable, Active Low) line is pulsed from high to low, then back to high again (the data bus’ contents are committed to the chip when the /WE line goes from low to high, known as a “rising edge”); the CLE line is pulled back low to return to its normal state. The Flash chip will then pull its R/B (Ready/Busy Status) line low to indicate it is busy resetting itself, then releases the line back to its high state when it’s finished.The READ ID command works similarly, except after writing the command with 0x90 (binary 1001 0000) on the data bus, it then pulls the ALE (Address Latch Enable) line high instead of CLE, and writes 0x00 (all binary zeroes) by pulsing the /WE line low. The chip transfers its internally programmed NAND Flash ID into its internal read register, and the data is read out from the device on each rising edge of the /RE (Read Enable, Active Low) line; for most devices this is 4 to 8 bytes of data.For each NAND Flash device, it has a (mostly) unique ID that identifies the manufacturer, and other functional data that is defined by that manufacturer; in other words, only the manufacturer ID, assigned by the JEDEC Technology Association, is well-defined.The first byte represents the Flash manufacturer, and the rest (2 to 6 bytes) define the device’s characteristics, as set out by the manufacturer themselves. Most NAND vendors are very tight-lipped when it comes to datasheets, and SanDisk (and by extension, Toshiba/Kioxia) maintain very strict control, save for some slightly outdated leaked Toshiba datasheets. Because the two aforementioned companies share their NAND fabrication facilities, we can reasonably presume the data structures in the vendor-defined bytes can be referenced against each other.In the case of the SanDisk High Endurance 128GB card, it has a NAND Flash ID of 0x45 48 9A B3 7E 72 0D 0E. Some of these values can be compared against a Toshiba datasheet:Description/InterpretationI/O voltage: Presumed 1.8 volts (measured with multimeter)Device capacity: Presumed 128 GB (unable to confirm against datasheet)NAND type: TLC (Triple-Level Cell / 3 bits per cell)Flash dies per /CE: 4 (card uses four 32GB Flash chips internally)Block size: 12 MiB (768 pages per block) excluding spare area (determined outside datasheet)Page size: 16,384 bytes / 16 kiB excluding spare areaPlanes per /CE: 8 (2 planes per die)Interface type: AsynchronousProcess geometry: BiCS3 3D NAND (determined outside datasheet)Unknown (no information listed in datasheet)Unknown (no information listed in datasheet)Although not all byte values could be conclusively determined, I was able to determine that the , but at least it is  which improves endurance dramatically compared to traditional/planar NAND. Unfortunately, from this information alone, I cannot determine whether the card’s controller takes advantage of any SLC caching mechanisms for write operations.The chip’s process geometry was determined by looking up the first four bytes of the Flash ID, and cross-referencing it to a line from a configuration file in Silicon Motion’s mass production tools for their SM3271 USB Flash drive controller, and their SM2258XT DRAM-less SSD controller. These tools revealed supposed part numbers of SDTNAIAMA-256G and SDUNBIEMM-32G respectively, but I don’t think this is accurate for the specific Flash configuration in this card.I wanted to make sure that I was getting the correct ID from the NAND Flash, so I rigged up a Texas Instruments MSP430FR2433 development board and wrote some (very) rudimentary code to send the required RESET and READ ID commands, and attempt to extract any extra data from the chip’s hidden JEDEC Parameter Page along the way.My first roadblock was that the MSP430 would reset every time it attempted to send the RESET command, suggesting that too much current was being drawn from the MSP430 board’s limited power supply. This can occur during bus contention, where two devices “fight” each other when trying to set a certain digital line both high and low at the same time. I was unsure what was going on, since publicly-available information didn’t mention how to disable the card’s built-in controller (doing so would cause it to tri-state the lines, effectively “letting go” of the NAND bus and allowing another device to take control).I figured out that the A1 test pad (see diagram) was the controller’s reset line (pulsing this line low while the card was running forced my card reader to power-cycle it), and by holding the line low, the controller would release its control of the NAND Flash bus entirely. After this, my microcontroller code was able to read the Flash ID correctly and consistently.Reading out the card’s Flash ID with my own microcontroller code.JEDEC Parameter Page… or at least what SanDisk made of it!The JEDEC Parameter Page, if present, contains detailed information on a Flash chip’s characteristics with far greater detail than the NAND Flash ID – and it’s well-standardized so parsing it would be far easier. However, it turns out that SanDisk decided to ignore the standard format, and decided to use their own proprietary Parameter Page format! Normally the page starts with the ASCII string “JEDEC”, but I got a repeating string of “SNDK” (corresponding with their stock symbol) with other data that didn’t correspond to anything like the JEDEC specification! Oh well, it was worth a try.I collected the data with the same Arduino sketch as shown above, and pulled 1,536 bytes’ worth of data; I wrote a quick program on Ideone to provide a nicely-formatted hex dump of the first 512 bytes of the Parameter Page data:Offset 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0A:0B:0C:0D:0E:0F 0123456789ABCDEF

The data that the Flash returned was… strange to say the least.I/O voltage: Unknown (no data)Device capacity: Unknown (no data)NAND type: SLC (Single-Level Cell / 1 bit per cell)Block size: 4 MB excluding spare areaPage size: 16,384 bytes / 16 kiB excluding spare areaInterface type: AsynchronousProcess geometry: 70 nm planarThis confused me initially when I was trying to find the ID from the logic capture alone; after talking to a contact who has experience in NAND Flash data recovery, they said this is expected for SanDisk devices, which make liberal use of vendor-proprietary commands and data structures. If the fourth byte is to be believed, it says the block size is 4 megabytes, which I think is plausible for a modern Flash device. The rest of the information doesn’t really make any sense to me apart from the first byte indicating the chip is made by Toshiba.I shouldn’t have to go this far in hardware reverse-engineering to just ask a simple question of what Flash SanDisk used in their high-endurance card. You’d think they would be proud to say they use 3D NAND for higher endurance and reliability, but I guess not!For those that are interested, I’ve included the logic captures of the card’s activity shortly after power-up. I’ve also included the (very crude) Arduino sketch that I used to read the NAND ID and Parameter Page data manually:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Modest – musical harmony library for Lua</title><link>https://github.com/esbudylin/modest</link><author>esbudylin</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 10:32:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a project I've been building in my spare time over the past few months. It's a library that provides methods for working with musical harmony ‒ intervals, notes, chords. For example, it can parse almost any chord symbol (Fmaj7, CminMaj9, etc) and turn it into notes, or it can identify a chord from a given set of notes.I started this project with the idea of using formal grammar to parse chord symbols. I wanted to use it instead of a hand-written parser, which is the common approach among similar libraries. Lua caught my attention because of Lpeg, a Parsing Expression Grammar library that is both fast and easy to use. An additional motivation for using Lua was the lack of comparable libraries for it, even though the language is commonly used in audio programming.However, despite being a Lua library, the project itself is written in Fennel — a "lispy" language that transpiles to Lua. Fennel has features that make writing code for the Lua platform much more pleasant: a concise syntax, macros, and destructuring — a feature Lua sorely lacks!In the process, I definitely learned a lot about music theory, although my new knowledge is quite one-sided. By working on this library, I know a thing or two about types and structure of chords, but I learned almost nothing about their composition and transformation. Perhaps these will be the directions I explore next in the project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keychron Q0 Max macropad review (Gateron Jupiter Banana)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj9cv_fpwDE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zj9cv_fpwDE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 10:19:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 3:39 for a typing demonstration.

You’re probably here to uncover the big secret: .\
Let’s be real — creating your own product is about two things: first and main, making money, and second, self-realization.\
This article will help you know how to sell your startup. I did it, and if I can, so can you.\
When I started my journey as an entrepreneur, I read a lot of stories about founders who had successful exits, selling their startups for huge amounts of money. Honestly, I think that’s a dream many of us share.\
But the reality is, not all of our startups take off — sometimes for all kinds of reasons.Lack of marketing skills or experience.Realizing your startup idea isn’t as good as you thought.Choosing the wrong niche or targeting the wrong audience.Feeling exhausted and needing a break.Burning out and losing interest.Facing financial pressure and needing money quickly.Being a developer but not a salesperson or marketer.\
Just because your project doesn’t need you anymore doesn’t mean it doesn’t need someone.\
I worked on my sold startup, SlideLab, for over two years. After that, it stayed online for a few years as a kind of “dead project.” I launched it with zero experience in startups.\
At the time, we were just a small local production studio. But let’s not dive into that now. If you’re curious about my solo entrepreneur journey, check out my  where I share more about it.\
So, my project sat for several years without visitors — basically dead weight. Were some new visitors, but not much. I decided to sell it and  where I could do that.\
I went to each platform, filled out their forms, sent any requested information, and then just waited. The whole process was completely free, of course.\
After some time, I started receiving emails with NDA requests and questions from interested buyers.At one point, I received an offer of $5,000 from SideProjectors, but I wanted more. Some people asked additional questions about my tech stack, business idea, audience, and similar details.\
In the end, I sold my startup to a software development team. The buyer reached out to me via DM, and we chatted for a few hours to discuss the price. Once we agreed on a price, the buyer sent me a purchase agreement. We decided to split the payment into two parts: one payment upfront and the second after the product was transferred to the buyer’s server.\
It was my first experience selling a product, but I found it surprisingly simple and easy. I believe this was because I build my business in public. I shared all reports, updates, and ideas about my products, and I’ve always been open-minded. When someone wants to buy your product, all they need to do is check your social media to make their decision.\
It took 8 months from the moment I first published the sale. I can’t share all the details of the deal because, of course, I signed an NDA and other documents. It wasn’t a huge amount, but it’s enough for me to live as a solo entrepreneur in Thailand for a year. It gives me the freedom to continue being a solo entrepreneur and focus solely on my new products.\
Now I’m working on my next product. It helps domain investors . I find these domains by web scraping authoritative sources like Product Hunt, Medium, Forbes, and other popular websites.Before I decided to sell my unused online presentation editor, I struggled with a lot of fears. Over time, I realized these fears are actually quite common among developers and startup owners.If the startup doesn’t generate income, it’s impossible to sell.My product doesn’t have any customers.My product doesn’t have visitors.It’s not actively promoted or running.My product isn’t valuable to anyone.The selling process is difficult and unclear.How much is my startup worth if it doesn’t have any income?If you sell something, it means you’re selling something of bad quality.All of these fears are just in your mind.Now, let’s look at it from a different perspective: the buyers.Buyers have money, right? So why do they search for and buy startups?Some small software development companies want to test a hypothesis. Buying a ready-to-use product with similar features can be cheaper than paying a team for 3–5 months.Some wealthy individuals with no experience in tech want to try it out. They can buy a product they like and treat it as a business experiment — hiring a team, marketing, developing, and promoting it, like playing with a toy constructor.If your project is on a valuable domain, domain investors might buy it. A ready-to-use website on a premium domain increases its value, especially with the added benefits of SEO.The startup might have innovative technology, software, or patents that the buyer sees as valuable for their own operations or future projects.Even if the startup doesn’t have income, it might have a strong user base, community, or audience that can be monetized later.Buyers might see potential for the startup to grow into a profitable business with the right resources, strategy, or scaling efforts.The product might complement or enhance the buyer’s existing offerings, creating opportunities for cross-selling or upselling.\
So, as you can see, buyers are ready to acquire your projects.My offer aligned perfectly with one of their reasons. They needed a ready-to-use online editor and wanted to add some AI automation features to quickly test their hypothesis.What else can you do to try and sell your project?\
I published it everywhere I could for free:If you want to successfully sell your project, you need to set the right price. The right price is crucial — don’t be greedy, but also don’t undervalue your work. A low price can make your product seem less valuable.Make sure your project is always online. Renew your domain, hosting, and SSL certificates. I forgot about SSL initially, but the buyer asked me to fix it to review and test the product — and I’m thankful he did.Your project description should be detailed and comprehensive. Include all relevant information about your project: social media pages, monthly visitors, features, successful or failed experiments, business ideas, and anything else that paints a full picture.Don’t be afraid to be public and share everywhere that you’re selling your project.\

Good luck with selling your project!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The magnitude of a student protest in Novi Sad.

The president of Burundi has also warned that the escalating conflict could lead to a regional war. M23 rebels are trying to advance southwards, days after capturing the key eastern city of Goma. 
Life in Goma is gradually returning to normal despite the rebel takeover. Some markets are reopening and traders are entering the city on roads that were blocked by fighting. But cash and fuel are scarce, and many people are still cut off from food and water. And thousands of displaced people have fled camps on the outskirts of the city, citing a lack of security.

Scientists have found that using seismometers is a new and inexpensive method to detect falling space junk, which can cause damage on impact and carry toxic materials — and may someday turn deadly... 

It's not an easy task to track large hunks of falling metal everywhere in the world. Ground-based radar can detect falling objects, but it doesn't cover much of the world or is often classified data, said Ben Fernando [a planetary scientist at Johns Hopkins University who is leading this research]. The other option is through optical instruments, such as doorbell cameras, but the information on the time, size and speed can be limited. Instead, Fernando turned to seismology data. Stations located around the world live-stream data, which can be easily downloaded. Seismometers have been used to track meteors in the sky for over a century, but he said this is the first time he's aware of its use for tracking space debris. 
Stations located around the world live-stream data, which can be easily downloaded. Seismometers have been used to track meteors in the sky for over a century, but he said this is the first time he's aware of its use for tracking space debris. Fernando first tested the idea to track the controlled reentry of NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission in September 2023, which brought back material from the asteroid Bennu. He set up seismometers along the capsule's path in the landing spot in Utah and measured its sonic boom. "It's a really good way of monitoring what's coming in, how often it's coming in, how big the things hitting the Earth are," said Fernando, who presented his results at the American Geophysical Union conference in December... 

"The shockwave deforms the ground around the seismometer," said Fernando. "It also keeps ringing for a lot longer because all of that energy is bouncing around in the soil...." [H]e said an automated system could help detect these objects within moments of it appearing on the stations. In addition to detecting an event, the seismometers can help locate where any debris may have fallen. Tracking debris is important because some space debris can contain toxic materials that can harm the surrounding environment. 

The article notes reports of the uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere of at least 951 objects larger than one square meter from 2010 to 2022. 

"On average, objects heavier than 1,000 pounds came down about every 8 days... In fact, the threat of getting hit by uncontrolled orbital reentries has increased by a factor of four from 2010 to 2023, said Luciano Anselmo, who published a study assessing the risk."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: Lumoz Launches SVM as a Service, Supporting the Integration of ZK and TEE Multi-Proof for SVM L2 (2/2/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-2-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 07:10:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @infinity [ 6 Min read ]

The company revealed this in a system card — a document outlining how an AI system works — that was released along with its new "reasoning" model, o3-mini, on Friday.... OpenAI says it collects user posts from r/ChangeMyView and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 
The ChatGPT-maker has a content-licensing deal with Reddit that allows OpenAI to train on posts from Reddit users and display these posts within its products. We don't know what OpenAI pays for this content, but Google reportedly pays Reddit $60 million a year under a similar deal. However, OpenAI tells TechCrunch the ChangeMyView-based evaluation is unrelated to its Reddit deal. It's unclear how OpenAI accessed the subreddit's data, and the company says it has no plans to release this evaluation to the public... 

The goal for OpenAI is not to create hyper-persuasive AI models but instead to ensure AI models don't get too persuasive. Reasoning models have become quite good at persuasion and deception, so OpenAI has developed new evaluations and safeguards to address it. 
Reddit's "ChangeMyView" subreddit has 3.8 million human subscribers, making it a valuable source of real human interactions, according to the article. And it adds one more telling anecdote. 
"Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told The Verge last year that Microsoft, Anthropic, and Perplexity refused to negotiate with him and said it's been 'a real pain in the ass to block these companies.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CDC: Unpublished manuscripts mentioning certain topics must be pulled or revised</title><link>https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-news-cdc-orders-mass-retraction</link><author>KittenInABox</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 04:52:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada to Impose 25% Tariffs on $107 Billion of US-Made Goods</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syUV6fbWtNQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/syUV6fbWtNQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 04:08:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on almost everything the US imports from the country, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will respond by placing 25% counter-tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) worth of American-made products.

"The teachers faded away pretty quickly," Gates adds, "But about six of us stayed hardcore. One was Paul Allen..." — the future co-founder of Microsoft. And the experience clearly meant a lot to Gates. "Microsoft just never would've happened without Paul — and this teletype room." 

In a longer post thanking his "brilliant" teachers, Gates calls his teletype experience "an encounter that would shape my entire future" and "opened up a whole new world for me." Gates also thanks World War II Navy pilot and Boeing engineer Bill Dougall, who "was instrumental in bringing computer access to our school, something he and other faculty members pushed for after taking a summer computer class... The fascinating thing about Mr. Dougall was that he didn't actually know much about programming; he exhausted his knowledge within a week. But he had the vision to know it was important and the trust to let us students figure it out." 

Gates shared a similar memory about the computer-room's 20-something overseer Fred Wright, who "intuitively understood that the best way to get students to learn was to let us explore on our own terms. There was no sign-up sheet, no locked door, no formal instruction."

Instead, Mr. Wright let us figure things out ourselves and trusted that, without his guidance, we'd have to get creative... Some of the other teachers argued for tighter regulations, worried about what we might be doing in there unsupervised. But even though Mr. Wright occasionally popped in to break up a squabble or listen as someone explained their latest program, for the most part he defended our autonomy... 
Mr. Wright gave us something invaluable: the space to discover our own potential.

On Monday, over a trillion dollars was wiped off the US stock market due to the appearance of a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

The release of a new reasoning model, known as R1, led investors to question US dominance in tech, their expectations around future AI capex while also raising the prospect that China might beat Silicon Valley at its own game.

The new DeepSeek model can “reason” to solve complex problems and performs as well as the AI software from US tech giants like Google and OpenAI, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.

DeepSeek quickly overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.

Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.

Back in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.
They also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. 
A nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.
For four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General’s Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

ABSTRACT
The software industry is changing faster than ever. Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.

In this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?

In short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?

They were all telling one another the same thing: Data on the website were about to disappear, or be altered, to comply with the Trump administration’s ongoing attempt to scrub federal agencies of any mention of gender, DEI, and accessibility. “I was up until 2 a.m.,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan who relies on the CDC’s data to track viral outbreaks, told me. She archived whatever she could.The full scope of the purge isn’t yet clear. One document obtained by  indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several “suggested keywords”—including “pregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [], non-binary [], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns”—in CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities—making it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.CDC data’s “explicit purpose” is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, “it’s hard to understand how this benefits health.”When I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that “all changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump’s January 20 Executive Orders” on gender and DEI.The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without “changing the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,” and that any such changes should be considered “routine.” Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.“My fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,” then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, “so we know where to target our health interventions.” She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have higher rates of STIs, but lower rates of obesity; transgender women have higher rates of HIV, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country’s ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to “erasing our ability to use data and evidence” to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing “gender” with “sex,” or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States’ 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. “Officials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,” Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to plateau in the U.S., after decades of steady increase—but altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that “provides a justification to cut funding,” one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government’s actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that’s an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they’d be in a position where they’d have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 RISC-V Kernel Adds Support For T-Head Vector Extensions, GhostWrite</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-RISC-V</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 11:44:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The RISC-V CPU architecture feature updates have now been submitted and merged for the nearly-over Linux 6.14 merge window...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: TalkNotes – A site that turns your ideas into tasks</title><link>https://www.talknotes.tech/</link><author>ajlkshdaksjd</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 11:43:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Turn any audio into smart notesTurn hours of note taking into seconds.

We are happy to share Perforator – our internal cluster-wide profiler with great support for native languages and a built-in AutoFDO pipeline to simplify sPGO builds. Perforator allows you to profile most binaries without having to recompile or adjust the build process. We use it at Yandex to profile each pod inside a large cluster at modest speed (99Hz), collecting petabytes of profiles every day.Inspired by Google-Wide Profiling, we started continuous profiling years ago with simple tools like poormansprofiler.org. With the rise of eBPF, we came up with a simple and elegant solution providing detailed profiles without noticeable overhead. Pretty wild when you can see the guts of your production binaries in a flamegraph without them even noticing.- Our main contribution is infrastructure for continuous PGO using AutoFDO. Google and Meta have done tremendous work on building PGO infrastructure, and we made the last missing piece of the puzzle to make this work well and scalable.- Native binaries are profiled through eh_frame analysis, interpreted/JIT-compiled languages are profiled through perf-pid.map or hardcoded structure offsets.- We render profiles in multiple ways, the most common one is a fast implementation of FlameGraphs, rendering 1M frames in 100ms.- We provide Helm charts to easily deploy Perforator on your k8s cluster.- You can use Perforator in standalone mode as a replacement for perf record.I'd love to answer your questions about the tool!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>India pledges fresh billion for startups</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/india-pledges-fresh-billion-for-startups/</link><author>Manish Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 07:37:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[India announced a new $1.15 billion Fund of Funds for startups on Saturday while unveiling sweeping regulatory reforms and an ambitious nuclear energy program, as New Delhi seeks to boost tech innovation and clean energy in the world’s fifth-largest economy.

From the report: The Terminal app first appeared in the Android 15 QPR2 beta as a developer option, and it still remains locked behind developer settings. Since its initial public release, Google pushed a few changes that fixed issues with the installation process and added a settings menu to resize the disk, forward ports, and backup the installation. However, the biggest changes the company has been working on, which include adding hardware acceleration support and a full graphical environment, have not been pushed to any public releases.
 
Thankfully, since Google is working on this feature in the open, it's possible to simply compile a build of AOSP with these changes added in. This gives us the opportunity to trial upcoming features of the Android Linux Terminal app before a public release. To demonstrate, we fired up the Linux Terminal on a Pixel 9 Pro, tapped a new button on the top right to enter the Display activity, and then ran the 'weston' command to open up a graphical environment. (Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, a modern display server protocol.)
 
We also went ahead and enabled hardware acceleration beforehand as well as installed Chocolate Doom, a source port of Doom, to see if it would run. Doom did run, as you can see below. It ran well, which is no surprise considering Doom can run on literal potatoes. There wasn't any audio because an audio server isn't available yet, but audio support is something that Google is still working on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&quot;NOVA-Core&quot; Patches Propose Building New NVIDIA Driver Piece-By-Piece In The Linux Kernel</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/NOVA-Core-Patches</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 01:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Red Hat engineers have been working on Nova as an open-source driver successor to the Nouveau driver for upstream NVIDIA GPU support within the Linux kernel that can be used with the Mesa OpenGL/Vulkan drivers.

It turns out that if you include any expletives in your search query, Google will not return an AI Overview, as they are called, at the top of the results page.For instance, if you search “How large is the student body of Yale University?” the search results page will return a large AI-generated blurb above the blue links. If you instead search, “How large is the fucking student body at Yale University?” you will instead get a standard list of blue link results, sans-AI summary.This is not the first time internet sleuths have discovered a way to disable Google’s AI-powered results. Other methods are more complicated, however, like adding a specific string of characters to the search results page URL. This method of swearing and pleading at Google to “just give me the fucking links” is much more cathartic.We are going to go out on a limb here and say that if people are regularly finding techniques to disable AI summaries in Google searches, perhaps that means they do not want them in the first place? Google search results have never been perfect, of course—there is still a lot of poor information across the web. But AI summaries present users with a prominent blurb at the top of their search that looks authoritative when it just risks compounding the misinformation problem with more erroneous slop.It is the same way Siri has been made worse by its integration with ChatGPT. At least in the past, when the voice assistant did not know how to answer a question it would just throw users to the web. Now Siri offers up ChatGPT-generated responses instead, sometimes spitting out incorrect nonsense instead of admitting it is not sure. But this is all being forced on users whether they like it or not. From Google Docs to X and Instagram, there are AI buttons and search boxes and dropdowns everywhere now, because every tech company needs to have an AI strategy. Is a basic keyword search too much to ask?When Google first introduced AI Overviews into search, it went viral for returning nonsensical responses, such as suggesting that one can prevent cheese from sliding off their pizzas by using glue or improve gut health by eating pebbles. It is believed Google’s model sourced the information from Reddit comments. AI does not know how to identify sarcasm or satire. earlier reported on the new loophole, which, if we are speculating, is caused by Google’s overly cautious steering of its AI model. Whereas a bot like xAI’s Grok is more than happy to swear and discuss sensitive topics, Google’s Gemini keeps it PG. Google has likely trained Gemini to avoid repeating expletives, so it simply is disabled in search when a curse word is present in order to avoid that.Google has argued that AI Overviews, as they are called, do not reduce traffic sent to websites because users will view summaries and be interested in delving deeper into the source material after finding something of interest. That logic has not comforted media companies, which have been litigating the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity for ingesting their content into large language models.We imagine Google will close the expletive loophole eventually, but in the meantime, if you are sick of AI, you now know an easy way to avoid it. Just tell Google to give you the fucking links.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over the top auth strategies (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/78</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/78/changelog--friends-78.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan Moore from FusionAuth joins us for a wide-ranging discussion about modern auth strategies.

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.

This is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. 

Because shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?

The story of Chrissy Teigen’s paternal great-grandparents was largely unknown to her. Research determines that she is descended from multiple generations of musicians, and from the Sinti people, a subgroup of the Romani people. The Roma, or Romani people were often denigrated as Gypsies, but it explains why Teigen’s ancestors moved so often.

Chrissy Teigen is a New York Times #1 bestselling author, TV personality and the founder of food and lifestyle brand Cravings. In 2016, Teigen released “Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat” which debuted #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and marked the first time a cookbook debuted #1 on USA Today's best-seller list. Teigen cohosted and executive produced “Chrissy & Dave Dine Out” with David Chang. She also executive produced and starred in “Chrissy’s Court”, executive produced the HBO Max documentary series “The Way Down”, and starred opposite Tina Fey and Nat Faxon in the Netflix animated comedy series “Mulligan”.

Synchronicity makes an extraordinary claim about reality—events may be linked in diverse and strange ways that defy all physical law, causality and common sense. What would it mean if events may relate to each other only by some kind of meaning, however obscure, not by some kind of physical interaction? This type of extraordinary claim demands extraordinary evidence.

ABSTRACT
Playwright is the hottest browser automation tool on the market. You can use it for testing and web scraping, but also for production monitoring!

In this talk I’ll explain the basics of Playwright, show real life (code) examples and explain how to use browser automation for effective, high signal to noise production monitoring: I like to call this the “monitoring as code” workflow. After this talk, you will have the basic knowledge on using Playwright in your own dev pipeline and catch errors on production. [...]

Our ability to learn about phenomena and worlds that seem almost
impossibly out of reach, now give us an incredible insight into the universe we occupy, and how we got here.

Brian and Robin find out about some of the big new missions providing information into our own solar system and beyond, and find out what big questions in cosmology still remain a tantalising challenge?

Höss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about Höss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'.

According to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.

It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel.Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk about what in their life led them to where they are now, and painting a somber undertone to the world that begs to be uncovered through its detailed lore notes and optional collectibles.I especially love how Eternal Strands packages aspects of its history so they're viewed through the art of weaving--not a typical choice for action-adventure games. Concepts like spells are recontextualized, transforming from arcane runes into fashion choices. You can largely avoid the historical exposition if you'd rather spend your time swinging a sword and spewing fire, but there's some great writing to uncover here for lore hounds.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Details Its Pluton-Capable Partner Security Engine With Core Ultra Series 2</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Partner-Security-Engine</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 17:53:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the details not too widely talked about with Intel's newest Core Ultra Series 2 processors is the introduction of the Partner Security Engine, which is a new dedicated security engine on the SOC that is capable of running the Microsoft Pluton firmware and software.

This film’s protagonists are united by the challenges, suffering and constant change they face - as well as by their confidence that things will turn out well in the end.

When Lend Mustafa loses his mother, he plunges into a deep crisis. She was his most important support as he embarked on a difficult journey: Lend had decided to live not as a woman, but as a trans man. Not an easy decision in the patriarchal Kosovar society in which Lend lives. But Lend stays true to his decision and goes on to open a club in Kosovo for the queer community. 
Ekaterina Straijewa is also familiar with the challenges of living in a patriarchal society. In Bulgaria, she was a successful racing driver. Despite her success, she faced ridicule for being a woman on the racetrack. Then an assault forced her to give up her profession. Her whole life was thrown into question. But she manages to fight her way back and climbs into the cockpit once again. 
Bashkim Lilo grew up in the Albanian mountains and worked as a shepherd. When he was offered the opportunity to train as a nursing assistant, he jumped at the chance. Because it was clear to him that this was the only way he and his family would have a future in Albania.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn sits down with esteemed philosophy Richard Swinburne to discuss how the problem of evil may provide a strong argument against theism, the theory of the Trinity, animals in evolution, and more.

Richard Granville Swinburne FBA is an English philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of "The Coherence of Theism", "The Existence of God", and "Faith and Reason". He has been influential in reviving substance dualism as an option in philosophy of mind.

We provide an examination of SDcpp, its components, and the technical concepts that enable efficient inference of Stable Diffusion models on lower-end hardware such as CPUs and lightweight GPUs, such as Apple M-series chips. In particular, we’re looking at Flux.1, a text-to-image model developed by Black Forest Labs.Introduction to Diffusion Models and Stable DiffusionDiffusion models, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have emerged as powerful generative frameworks capable of producing high-fidelity images from random noise through iterative denoising processes. Stable Diffusion extends the DDPM framework by incorporating text conditioning, allowing for the generation of images based on descriptive prompts. However, the computational demands of such models typically necessitate high-memory, high-bandwidth GPU resources, limiting their accessibility and scalability.SDcpp addresses these limitations by providing an optimized inference framework that leverages techniques such as quantization, memory-efficient sampling, and optimized latent space representations to facilitate the deployment of Stable Diffusion models on devices with constrained computational resources. This paper delves into the architectural and algorithmic components of SDcpp, highlighting the methodologies that underpin its efficiency and performance.The architecture is composed of several interdependent modules, each contributing to the inference process. First, it is loading the required models (1), including text encoders, the diffusion model, and the VAE decoder. It then performs  (2), tokenizing the input prompt and generating text embeddings using a CLIP-based model and an additional T5XXL text conditioning model. Next, it computes the conditioning graph (3), transforming embeddings to create a guidance vector for the diffusion process. The system then  (4) by iteratively refining a randomly initialized latent tensor using a noise schedule and a chosen sampling method, progressively steering it towards a structured latent representation in a number of . This step is the most compute-intensive, consuming roughly 90% of the total processing time. Once sampling completes, the pipeline decodes the latent representation (5) using a VAE model to reconstruct pixel-space information. Finally, it  (6) as an image file, completing the text-to-image generation process.Diffusion Model Core ComponentsThe diffusion model within SDcpp is the principal generative engine, responsible for transforming Gaussian noise into coherent images through a series of denoising . More steps allow finer details and smoother outputs but increase inference time, as each step requires additional computation. This process is governed by the DDPM framework, wherein the model iteratively refines the image by removing noise in a controlled manner. The diffusion model encompasses three primary components:UNet (Denoising Network): the UNet architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and reconstruction. The network predicts and removes noise at each denoising step, progressively enhancing image quality.Text Encoder (Conditioning Module): The text encoder converts textual prompts into latent embeddings that guide the denoising process. SDcpp supports multiple text encoders, including CLIP-L, CLIP-G, and T5XXL, each tailored for different model versions and memory considerations.Scheduler (Noise Controller): The scheduler orchestrates the noise removal strategy, dictating the temporal progression of denoising steps. It determines the rate and manner in which noise is reduced, balancing computational efficiency and image fidelity.A recent model,  , is optimized for low-resource environments, featuring a compact UNet architecture that accelerates inference by reducing the number of denoising steps. Flux.1 is designed for memory-efficient quantization and compatibility with the GGUF format, making it suitable for deployment on lightweight hardware. It reduces inference steps to only 4 steps and can achieve fast inference.Variational Autoencoder (VAE)VAEs facilitating the encoding of images into a lower-dimensional latent space. This reduction significantly diminishes computational and memory overhead while retaining high-resolution image details. Latent space is a compact mathematical representation of an image. Think of it as a highly efficient shorthand where only the most essential details are stored. Instead of storing every pixel, the image is encoded as numbers that describe its features. This makes it possible to work with images at a much lower computational cost. Stable Diffusion doesn’t generate images pixel by pixel. Instead, it creates images in latent space, where information is stored in a more compact and manageable way. Once the model finishes generating an image in this space, the VAE  it back into a high-resolution format that we can see.Different VAEs can influence how well the final image looks. A generic VAE works for most images, but a model trained for a specific style, like anime or realistic photography, may use a custom VAE to better match its training data. A poorly matched VAE can cause color shifts, blurriness, or unwanted artifacts.Technically, any model can use any VAE, but results vary. A VAE trained on cartoon-style images won’t reconstruct a photorealistic image correctly. This is why some models provide their own VAEs — they have been optimized to maintain details that matter most for a specific style.LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)LoRA facilitates model customization without the need to adjust the entire diffusion model. By modifying only a small subset of parameters (~10 million), LoRA significantly reduces memory usage compared to full model fine-tuning. Multiple LoRAs can be combined with weighted influences on the final image, enabling diverse stylistic and feature modifications. For instance, combining two LoRAs with different weights can be executed using the syntax <lora:styleA:0.6> <lora:styleB:0.8>. To optimize performance, it is advisable to minimize the number and strength of LoRAs, especially in memory-limited environments.Training and Inference File FormatsThe  is the standard PyTorch checkpoint format, that stores full precision weights and optimizer states. Supports training and fine-tuning but can execute arbitrary Python code, posing security risks. SafeTensors (.safetensors) is a safer alternative to CKPT, with structured, immutable storage and no executable code. Loads faster but still used mainly for training.GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary model format introduced by llama.cpp, succeeding GGML. Initially designed for language models (like LLaMA models), GGUF has been adopted in diffusion models to enable efficient, quantized inference without reformatting model files into proprietary formats (e.g., .ggml or .gguf conversions required previously). Traditional formats (.safetensors, .ckpt, .bin) store full-precision FP16/FP32 model weights, consuming significant VRAM. GGUF introduces quantization at multiple levels, storing models in 2-bit to 16-bit precision while maintaining compatibility with SDcpp.Use GGUF for efficient inference on low-resource devices, prefer .safetensors for training.In our experiments,  demonstrates an extremely fast denoising process, with images at 1 and 2 steps appearing nearly identical, suggesting that most structural information is determined in the very first iterations. By 4 steps, images diverge significantly, and by 6 steps, they change even more, indicating that additional steps introduce large variations rather than just refining details. Interestingly, Euler and Euler_a produce the best results, likely because they follow a balanced noise reduction trajectory, allowing structure to form naturally without over-smoothing or excessive deviations. Euler introduces noticeable changes between 3, 4, and 6 steps, including shifts in pose, face, and hair color, implying that it follows a latent space trajectory where small step changes can drastically impact the final result. Euler_a, being an ancestral sampler, adds controlled randomness at each step, further amplifying these changes. In contrast, LCM performs poorly with Flux 1, excessively blurring images, likely due to its tuning for models that require more iterative refinement, making it unsuitable for Flux 1’s fast-converging architecture. We observed that 4 steps often produce better images than 5 or 6 steps, as extra iterations introduce unnecessary alterations instead of improving details, reinforcing that Flux 1 is optimized for extremely low-step inference. This is a stark contrast to Stable Diffusion models like SD 1.5 or SDXL, which typically require 20–50 steps for high-quality outputs. These findings highlight that Flux 1’s unique training favors fewer steps with the right sampler, making Euler and Euler_a better choices at around 4 steps, while models like LCM fail due to excessive denoising.Denoising Schedules and Sampling IntegrationDenoising schedules define a series of noise levels that guide reverse diffusion. These schedules set discrete or continuous noise decay steps, essentially parameterizing the stochastic differential equation used to reverse the diffusion process. Discrete schedules apply abrupt noise transitions, forcing the model to rapidly shift between latent states. In contrast, smooth schedules such as karras or exponential distribute noise reduction evenly, supporting more accurate latent updates.Sampling methods numerically integrate these latent trajectories. Euler-type samplers update the latent state with fixed time step approximations, benefiting from stable transitions when paired with smooth noise decay. Latent Consistency Models (LCM) depend on gradual noise reduction; abrupt schedules can induce over-smoothing and detail loss. Our observations indicate that matching a sampling method’s sensitivity to noise decay with an appropriate denoising schedule is key to preserving image structure while ensuring efficient inference.Flux.1’s behavior indicates that its training regime emphasizes rapid structure formation in early steps. Euler’s robustness across discrete, exponential, and karras schedules suggests that its integration of abrupt noise transitions still aligns well with Flux.1’s latent dynamics. LCM, being more sensitive to the noise decay, only works well with smoother schedules (exponential and karras) that provide gradual latent updates.The failures with AYS and GITS imply that these schedules impose noise trajectories incompatible with Flux.1’s fast-convergence design. Their latent paths likely diverge from the model’s learned reverse diffusion trajectory, causing the state to collapse into uniform or noisy outputs rather than structured images. This sensitivity reinforces that Flux.1 is optimized for few-step denoising with specific noise decay characteristics, and departures from that — especially with schedules that enforce alternative trajectory regularity — can disrupt the image generation process.Flux.1 departs from prior diffusion models by leveraging a T5-style text encoder instead of CLIP, allowing it to process full sentences fluently rather than relying on discrete token hierarchies. Unlike Stable Diffusion, where Booru-style tags and keyword emphasis are required for precision, Flux.1 understands natural language natively, reducing reliance on rigid token structures. Long, descriptive prompts yield better scene coherence, material accuracy, and relational awareness than fragmented keyword lists.Trigger words are optional rather than mandatory, as the model activates concepts contextually rather than requiring explicit token matching. However, structured elements — short modifiers or category cues — can refine specificity without overpowering Flux.1’s broader language comprehension. The model is particularly strong at multi-concept blending, which traditionally caused token interference in CLIP-based architectures. Negative prompting is also more effective, reducing the unintended blending of attributes.Flux.1 performs best with contextual and relational descriptions, leveraging semantic depth over isolated tokens. While Booru tags still function, hybrid prompting — mixing structured elements with full sentences — offers the best balance between control and generative adaptability.LoRA functions differently in Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion. Since Flux.1 uses a T5-based encoder, LoRA activation does not require fixed trigger words but instead responds dynamically to natural descriptions. This allows LoRAs to integrate seamlessly into prompts without rigid dependencies.Key parameters such as network dimension, alpha scaling, and captioning density influence performance. Higher network dimension strengthens adaptation but risks overfitting, while alpha scaling balances LoRA integration with the base model. Flux.1’s LoRAs benefit from mixed captioning strategies — varying between short tags and natural descriptions — ensuring activation without over-constraining the generative process. Unlike SDXL, which often requires explicit weight scaling (1.2–1.5x) to activate LoRAs, Flux.1 adapts LoRA strength more organically within context, reducing the need for manual weight adjustments.To maximize LoRA performance in Flux.1, descriptive phrasing should replace rigid token triggers, using context-driven prompts to activate learned modifications naturally. Captions should balance specificity with generalization, ensuring LoRAs enhance rather than dominate the generative output.Optimization Strategies for Low-Resource InferenceQuantization is a pivotal technique in reducing model size and memory usage by lowering the precision of model weights. SDcpp supports various quantization levels, each offering a different balance between memory efficiency and image quality: Reduces memory usage by approximately 75% compared to full precision (FP16) while maintaining good image quality. It introduces a slight computational overhead due to dequantization but is optimal for low-end hardware. Offers slightly better precision than Q4 at the cost of requiring twice the memory. It is suitable for systems with more VRAM where higher image fidelity is desired.For lower-end hardware, Q4_K provides a good balance of speed and quality, while  is better for systems with more VRAM (>16GB).Quantization Impact of Model PartsWe’re loading a model, vae, clip, and t5, and can choose quantized parts for each. The model itself must be quantized due to memory constraints, but the VAE, CLIP, and T5 can remain in higher precision. We tested a q4_K model with safetensors in higher precision, and a fully quantized version where all parts were q4_0.We observed a 2.5x slowdown with the fully quantized run, despite reduced memory usage. Likely due to increased dequantization overhead, precision mismatch-induced stalls, and reduced SIMD efficiency on the Apple M2. While background processes may have contributed to higher involuntary context switches (3.3M vs. 1.48M), they do not fully explain the slowdown. The quantization format (q4_K vs. q4_0) influences computational efficiency rather than raw inference speed, with q4_K employing grouped quantization, which improves data locality and reduces dequantization frequency, while q4_0 likely applies simpler per-tensor quantization, increasing compute overhead. The hybrid approach—quantizing only the diffusion model while keeping VAE, CLIP, and T5 in higher precision—seems to better utilize hardware by avoiding unnecessary precision conversion costs and leveraging FP computation optimizations. These results suggest that full quantization may degrade performance when not optimized for architectural strengths, particularly on FP-optimized hardware like the M2.The sampling method determines the strategy by which noise is removed during the denoising process. Ancestral samplers introduce random variations at each step, leading to more diverse outputs, while fixed-step samplers follow a deterministic trajectory, yielding consistent results.SDcpp integrates several sampling algorithms optimized for different performance criteria: A simple and fast method effective with a lower number of denoising steps, suitable for rapid inference. Prioritizes image quality, requiring more steps and memory. It is ideal for applications where high detail is essential.Latent Consistency Models (LCM): Optimizes speed by drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps (e.g., 4–8 instead of 20–30), making it highly suitable for low-end systems. Users can specify the sampling method using the --sampling-method flag, such as --sampling-method lcm.Memory management is critical in ensuring that diffusion models run efficiently on constrained hardware. SDcpp employs several techniques to optimize memory usage: By processing the VAE decoder in smaller, manageable segments, VAE tiling minimizes peak memory usage. Flash Attention optimizes memory allocation during UNet computations. On CUDA-enabled GPUs, it offers significant memory savings and speed improvements. Flash Attention can be activated via the --diffusion-fa flag.In our experiments on an Apple M2, enabling --vae-tiling reduced memory usage but increased execution time, suggesting a trade-off between efficiency and speed. When --diffusion-fa (Flash Attention) was enabled, execution time did not significantly improve. The combination of both options (vae-tiling and diffusion-fa) resulted in the  but also the , confirming that while these settings help on low-VRAM devices, they introduce performance overhead. The fastest run occurred with both options disabled, though it had the highest memory footprint.Image resolution directly impacts both memory consumption and inference speed. Generating images at a resolution of 1280×640 requires approximately 2.5 times the memory of generating images at 512×512. To accommodate low-resource environments, users can opt for intermediate resolutions such as 768×384 or 1024×512, balancing image quality and computational efficiency.LoRA Delay and Conditioning Graph RecalculationWhen LoRA modules are applied, the conditioning graph must be recalculated due to LoRA’s modification of internal activations, which can reintroduce dependencies on structured tagging if the LoRA was trained on datasets requiring them. The conditioner parses and reweights prompt segments dynamically, adjusting token influence based on LoRA-induced shifts in the embedding space, ensuring compatibility between the altered diffusion model state and the input text. This recalibration process accounts for the delay seen post-LoRA application and before sampling, as the system must harmonize LoRA-induced parameter shifts with Flux.1’s inherently context-aware text encoding.Classifier-Free Guidance ScaleCFG scale (Classifier-Free Guidance Scale) can be set with the --cfg-scale argument. It defaults to 7.0 and controls how strictly the model follows the text prompt, balancing adherence and creativity. Higher values (e.g., 10-15) force the model to generate images that closely match the prompt but can introduce artifacts, while lower values (e.g., 1-5) allow more randomness and artistic interpretation. It impacts performance slightly because higher CFG values increase the weight difference between conditional (prompted) and unconditional (random) predictions, requiring additional computation to balance them. However, the effect on inference speed is minor compared to factors like resolution, model architecture, and sampling steps.Flux.1 seem to have been trained with  as target setting, meaning its internal weighting and contrast are optimized for that value. Lowering CFG to  reduces guidance too much, allowing excessive noise influence, resulting in darker, underexposed images. Raising it to 2.0 strengthens prompt adherence but overemphasizes highlights and contrast, making images appear overly bright. Unlike standard Stable Diffusion, where 7.0 is the default for balanced outputs, Flux.1’s tuning makes , with deviations causing unintended brightness shifts.To analyze the impact of CFG scale on image generation, we generated eight images using CFG 1.0 and 2.0 across the Euler, LCM, iPNDM, and Euler_a samplers with 4 steps and a fixed seed of 42, using the prompt “a beautiful girl in futuristic Tokyo, neon lights,” comparing how different guidance levels influence brightness, contrast, and prompt adherence.Memory-Efficient InferenceRunning Flux.1 (schnell) on an Apple M2 (16GB RAM), we achieve inference without a GPU, completing a 256×256 image in 216.3s with 9.28GB RAM usage. The UNet required just 96.59MB, and VAE decoding used 416MB, demonstrating the efficiency of quantized GGUF models.Our analysis of Stable-Diffusion.cpp and Flux.1 demonstrates that efficient local diffusion inference is feasible even on low-resource hardware, provided that model selection, quantization, and sampling strategies are optimized. Flux.1’s extremely low-step denoising makes it uniquely suited for fast inference, especially when paired with Euler and Euler_a samplers, which balance structure formation and controlled randomness. In contrast, models like LCM introduce excessive smoothing, making them unsuitable for Flux.1’s fast convergence.We also observed that 4 steps yield optimal results with Flux.1, as additional iterations introduce unnecessary alterations rather than improving image fidelity. While our results indicate that full quantization introduces dequantization overhead and computational stalls, external factors such as background system load may have influenced the extent of the observed slowdown. Memory-efficient techniques such as VAE tiling and Flash Attention can reduce hardware requirements but may introduce performance trade-offs. Users should select Q4_K or similar quantization for lower-end hardware, as grouped quantization schemes appear to mitigate some of the performance penalties associated with fully quantized inference.These findings highlight that with the right model architecture, quantization, and sampler choice, high-quality image generation is possible on constrained devices without relying on high-end GPUs. Future improvements may focus on further refining model architectures like Flux.1 and optimizing quantization methods for even faster, memory-efficient inference.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ups and downs of stratified cross-validation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpK9pWZGjbE</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EpK9pWZGjbE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:48:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you use GridSearchCV in scikit-learn will do a cross-validated hyperparameter search.

When JavaScript was created in 1995, the  object was copied from Java's early, flawed  implementation.
Java replaced this implementation in 1997, but JavaScript is stuck with the same API for almost 30 years, despite known problems.The major issues with JavaScript's  object are that it only supports the user's local time and UTC, and there's no time zone support.
Additionally, its parsing behavior is very unreliable, and  itself is mutable, which can introduce hard-to-trace bugs.
There are other problems like calculations across Daylight Saving Time (DST) and historical calendar changes, which are notoriously difficult to work with.All of these issues make working with dates and times in JavaScript complex and prone to bugs, which can have serious consequences for some systems.
Most developers rely on dedicated libraries like Moment.js and date-fns for better handling of dates and times in their applications.Temporal is designed as a full replacement for the  object, making date and time management reliable and predictable.
Temporal adds support for time zone and calendar representations, many built-in methods for conversions, comparisons and computations, formatting, and more.

Optimize storage and bandwidth costs.Daily Active Users (DAU): 10 million ~100,000 videos/dayAverage Videos Watched per User per Day: 5 videos 500 MB. 1 KB.: 100,000 videos / day * 500 MB / video = 50 TB / dayDaily Video Metadata Storage: 100,000 * 1KB = 100MB / dayNetwork Bandwidth Estimation:10 million users × 5 videos/user = 50 million views/day Daily Bandwidth Requirements (without compression & caching) : 50 million views * 500 MB / day = 25 PB / dayGiven the high storage and bandwidth requirements, leveraging  is the most practical approach:Content Delivery Network (CDN): To cache frequently accessed videos closer to users and reduce latency.Blob Storage (e.g., AWS S3): To store video files reliably with redundancy.We can break the architecture of YouTube into two primary components:  – Handles video playback, and delivery.Video Upload & Processing – Manages user uploads, transcoding, and metadata storage.3.1 Video Streaming Architecture]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Intelligence Pick Tulsi Gabbard Secretly Met Assad: What We Know | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmk9b7HXBzY</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bmk9b7HXBzY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 05:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahead of her U.S. Senate confirmation hearing for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard is facing renewed scrutiny over an unannounced trip to Syria where she met with the now-deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad twice.

  development processes, developed by Beth Andres-Beck and hir father Kent Beck.
  It posits that two communities of software developers have great difficulty
  communicating to each other because they live in very different contexts, so
  advice that applies to one sounds like nonsense to the other.The desert is the common world of software development, where bugs are
  plentiful, skill isn't cultivated, and communications with users is difficult.
  The forest is the world of a well-run team that uses something like Extreme Programming, where developers swiftly put changes into
  production, protected by their tests, code is invested in to keep it healthy,
  and there is regular contact with The Customer.Clearly Beth and Kent prefer The Forest (as do I). But the metaphor is more
  about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often
  sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us
  that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural
  patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible
  to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do
  things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for
  The Forest to submit to desertification.) In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks
  to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert
  Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more
  plentiful.Kent Beck supplied the image, which he may have painstakingly drew pixel by

Join historians, survivors and experts as they consider one of the great moral dilemmas of the 20th century. Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?

In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in Žilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler’s account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

Is free will required for moral responsibility? If a person with a brain tumor breaks the law, should that person be judged by lower standards? It’s a slippery slope, because if a legal defense is based on a ‘my brain did it, not me’ theory, and if it holds, law enforcement will suffer.

German submarine, surface and air attacks were sinking merchant ships by the hundred. If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. 

In this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.

Hardly any providers are hosting this model variant, and its availability is important for research purposes.ARC Prize Foundation’s goal is to define, measure, and inspire new ideas towards AGI. To this end, we strive to create the strongest global innovation environment possible.We do not have AGI yet and are still innovation constrained – scaling up pure LLM pretraining is not the path, despite this being the dominant AI industry narrative and mainstream public view as of last summer.The reason narratives are important is they end up driving economic activity, like investment, research focus, funding, geopolitics, trade, etc. For example, in 2023-24 there was ~$20B invested into new LLM startups compared to only ~$200M into new AGI startups.We launched ARC Prize 2024 last June to grow awareness of limits of scaling LLMs and promote a useful benchmark, ARC-AGI-1, towards a new direction that requires AI systems to adapt to novel, unseen problems instead of being able to rely strictly on memorization.Last week, DeepSeek published their new R1-Zero and R1 “reasoner” systems that is competitive with OpenAI’s o1 system on ARC-AGI-1. R1-Zero, R1, and o1 (low compute) all score around 15-20% – in contrast to ’s 5%, the pinnacle of years of pure LLM scaling. Based on this week’s US market reaction, the public is starting to understand the limits of scaling pure LLMs too. However, there is still broad public ignorance about impending inference demand.In December 2024, OpenAI announced a new breakthrough o3 system that we verified. It scored 76% in a low compute mode and 88% in a high compute mode. The o3 system demonstrates the first practical, general implementation of a computer adapting to novel unseen problems.This is an incredibly important moment for the field of AI and for computer science and these systems demand study. But due to the closed nature of o1/o3, we’re forced to rely on speculation. Thanks to ARC-AGI-1 and now (nearly) open source R1-Zero and R1, we can add to our understanding. In particular, R1-Zero is significantly more important than R1.“Nearly” because DeepSeek did not publish a reproducible way to generate their model weights from scratchR1-Zero removes the human bottleneckIn our o1 and o3 analysis, we speculated how these reasoning systems work. The key ideas:Generate chains-of-thought (CoT) for a problem domain.Label the intermediary CoT steps using a combination of human experts (“supervised fine tuning” or SFT) and automated machines (“reinforcement learning” or RL).Train base model using (2).At test time, iteratively inference from the process model.Techniques used to iterative sample, along with ARC-AGI-1 scores, are reviewed below:Note: ARC-AGI-1 semi-private score shown.With DeepSeek’s new published research, we can better inform our speculation. The key insight is that higher degrees of novelty adaptation (and reliability) for LLM reasoning systems are achieved along three dimensions:Adding human labels aka SFT to CoT process model trainingCoT search instead of linear inference (parallel per-step CoT inference)Whole CoT sampling (parallel trajectory inference)Item (1) is bottlenecked by human data generation and constrains which domains these reasoning systems benefit most. For example, the MMLU professional law category is surprisingly much lower than the math and logic on o1.Items (2) and (3) are bottlenecked by efficiency. o1 and o3 both show logarithmic improvement in benchmark accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 as they spend more inference compute at test time, while the different ways to spend that compute adjust the x-axis of the curve.In my opinion, the most interesting thing DeepSeek has done is to publish R1-Zero separately. R1-Zero is a model which does not use SFT, the (1) item. Instead it relies purely on reinforcement learning.R1-Zero and R1 show strong score agreement on  ARC-AGI-1, scoring 14% and 15% respectively. DeepSeeks’s own reported benchmark scores also show strong agreement between R1-Zero and R1, eg. on MATH AIME 2024 scores are 71% and 76% respectively (up from ~40% on the base DeepSeek V3).In the paper, R1-Zero authors say “DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing” and has been corroborated online. However in our testing, we found little to no evidence of incoherence when testing R1-Zero on ARC-AGI-1 which is similar to the math and coding domains the system was RL’d on.Taken together, these findings suggest:SFT (eg. human expert labeling) is not necessary for accurate and legible CoT reasoning in domains with strong verification.The R1-Zero training process is capable of creating its own internal domain specific language (“DSL”) in token space via RL optimization.SFT is necessary for increasing CoT reasoning domain generality.This makes intuitive sense, as language itself is effectively a reasoning DSL. The exact same “words” can be learned in one domain and applied in another, like a program. The pure RL approach can not yet discover a broad shared vocabulary and I expect this will be a strong focus for future research.Ultimately, R1-Zero demonstrates the prototype of a potential scaling regime with zero human bottlenecks – even in the training data acquisition itself.Almost certainly DeepSeek has set its sights on OpenAI’s o3 system. It is important to watch whether SFT ends up being a requirement to add CoT search and sampling, or whether a hypothetical “R2-Zero” could exist along the same logarithmic accuracy vs inference scaling curve. Based on R1-Zero results, I believe SFT will not be required to beat ARC-AGI-1 in this hypothetical scaled up version.There are two major shifts happening in AI, economically speaking:You can now spend more $ to get higher accuracy and reliabilityTraining $ is moving to inference $Both are going to drive a massive amount of demand for inference and neither will curtail the demand for more compute. In fact, they will increase the demand for compute.AI reasoning systems promise much greater returns than simply higher accuracy on benchmarks. The number one issue preventing more AI automation use (e.g. inference demand) is reliability. I’ve spoken with hundreds of Zapier’s customers trying to deploy AI agents in their businesses and the feedback is strongly consistent: “I don’t trust them yet because they don’t work reliably”.Previously I’ve argued that progress towards ARC-AGI would result in higher reliability. The challenge with LLM agents is they need strong local domain steering to work reliably. Stronger generalization capability requires the ability to adapt to unseen situations. We’re now starting to see evidence this view is correct. And so it’s no surprise several companies are now introducing agents (Anthropic, OpenAI, Apple, …)Agents will drive significant near-term demand inference due the reliability needs. More broadly, developers can choose to spend more compute to increase user trust in the system. More reliability does not mean 100% accuracy though – but you’d expect to be more consistently inaccurate. This is okay because users and developers can now more confidently steer behavior via prompting when accuracy is low.Problems that were impossible for computers previously now have dollar amounts attached to them. And as efficiency climbs, those dollar amounts will go down.The other major shift occurring is in the provenance of data going into LLM systems for pretraining. Previously, most data was either purchased, scraped, or synthetically generated from an existing LLM (eg. distilling or augmenting).These reasoning systems offer a new option which is to generate “real” data as opposed to “synthetic”. The AI industry uses the term synthetic to identify low quality data that is typically recycled through an LLM to boost the overall amount of training data – with diminishing returns.But now with reasoning systems and verifiers, we can create brand new legitimate data to train on. This can either be done offline where the developer pays to create the data or at inference time where the end user pays!This is a fascinating shift in economics and suggests there could be a runaway power concentrating moment for AI system developers who have the largest number of paying customers. Those customers are footing the bill to create new high quality data … which improves the model … which becomes better and more preferred by users … you get the idea.If we can break through the human expert CoT barrier and create an extremely efficient system to create new data via search/synthesis and verification, then we should expect a massive influx of compute to go into these inference systems as they quite literally get better just by inputting dollars and raw data. Eventually this type of AI training will eclipse pretraining on human generated data altogether.We will continue to see market corrections as increased inference demand becomes clear. AI system efficiency is only going to drive more usage, not just due to Jevons Paradox but because new regimes of training are unlocked as efficiency increases.With R1 being open and reproducible, more people and teams will be pushing CoT and search to the limits. This will more quickly tell us where the frontier actually lies and will fuel a wave of innovation that increases the chance of reaching AGI quickly.Several people have already told me they plan to use R1-style systems for ARC Prize 2025 and I’m excited to see the results.The fact that R1 is open is a great thing for the world. DeepSeek has pushed the frontier of science forward.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seychelles uncovered: The heroin crisis in paradise | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouSSXpNftmQ</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ouSSXpNftmQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 17:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Beneath the beauty, the Seychelles harbor a shocking secret: It’s estimated around 10% of the adult population is addicted to heroin. Drug trafficking and corruption reign.

The Seychelles, renowned for its white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters, seems like the perfect vacation destination. But the idyllic archipelago is facing a grim crisis: it has the highest rates of Heroin addiction in the world, estimated at around 10% of the adult population. And the country is a hub on one of the world’s biggest drug trafficking routes.

How did this tropical paradise become a hotspot for one of the world’s deadliest drugs? What role does international trafficking, tourism and corruption play in perpetuating the crisis? And what is happening to its people as the fight against this epidemic is losing ground?

It makes it easy to build AI apps with MCP servers, and implements every pattern from the popular Building Effective Agents blog [3] as well as OpenAI’s Swarm [4]. I’m sharing it early to get community feedback on where to take it from here, and to ask for contributions.For those who aren’t familiar with MCP, I think of it as a standardized interface to let AI communicate with software via tool calls, resources and prompts.mcp-agent provides a higher level interface to build apps with MCP. It handles the connection management of MCP servers so you don’t have to. It also implements the Building Effective Agents patterns:
- Augmented LLM (an LLM with access to one or more MCP servers)
- Router, Orchestrator-Worker, Evaluator-Optimizer, and more
- SwarmThe key design principles are composability and reusability – every pattern is an AugmentedLLM itself, so you can chain them into more complex workflows.Some background: I worked on LSP [5] and language servers at Microsoft, and saw firsthand how standards and protocols can revolutionize developer workflows. Before LSP every IDE had its own esoteric ways of providing language services. LSP changed all that, and arguably made every language server better, since they can focus on improving a single implementation for all clients.I think AI development is in a similar pre-LSP space right now. There are tons of frameworks [6], every model provider has its own way of handling messages, tool calls, streaming, etc. I really think we need a protocol to standardize these patterns.Pretty soon every service is going to expose an MCP interface, and mcp-agent is about letting developers orchestrate these services into applications (i.e. build “MCP apps”). This can cover any use of an AI model that needs to interact with the world around it:
- RAG pipelines and Q&A chatbots
- Process automation via AI workflows/async tasks
- Multi-agent orchestration, with human in the loopThe repo contains examples [7] to build RAG agents, streamlit apps and more. There’s a lot left to build, like streaming support, server auth and tighter integration with MCP clients.But I wanted to share early in the hopes that you can guide me:
- If you find this useful, please let me know. If it’s useful to you, I will dedicate all my time to improving it.
- I really welcome contributions. If you want to collaborate, please reach out on github to help take this forward.I want to help standardize AI development, so developers a few years from now can look back with horror at the pre-MCP days.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Distr – open-source distribution platform for on-prem deployments</title><link>https://github.com/glasskube/distr</link><author>louis_w_gk</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:21:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Distr is designed to help software engineers distribute and manage their applications or agents in customer-controlled or shared-responsibility environments. You only need a Docker Compose file or Helm chart—everything else for on-prem is handled by the platform.We’re are an open source dev tool company. Over the past couple of months, we’ve spoken with dozens of software companies to understand their challenges with on-prem deployments. We analyzed the internal tools they’ve built and the best practices from existing solutions, combining them into a prebuilt, Open Source solution that works out of the box and integrates seamlessly.Distr consists of two key components:1. Hub - Provides a centralized view of all deployments and controls connected agents. - Comes with a simple GUI but also supports API and SDK access for seamless integration. - Fully Open- Surce and self-hostable, or you can use our fully managed platform.2. Lightweight Agents - Pre-built agents for Helm (Kubernetes) and Docker Compose (VM) that run alongside your application. - Handle lifecycle tasks like guided installation, updates, and rollbacks. - Provide basic metrics (health status, application version) and logsIf you already have a customer portal or self-service interface for on-prem deployments, you can seamlessly integrate all features into your existing portal or application using our API or SDK. Alternatively, you can use our pre-built, white-labeled customer portal.Here’s what an integration into your existing customer portal could look like:  import {DistrService} from "@glasskube/distr-sdk";
  
  const customerHasAutoUpdatesEnabled = false; // replace with your own logic
  const deploymentTargetId = 'da1d7130-bfa9-49a1-b567-c49728837df7';
  const service = new DistrService({
      apiKey: 'distr-8c24167aeb5fd4bb48b6d2140927df0f'
  });
  
  const result = await service.isOutdated(deploymentTargetId);
  if(result.deploymentTarget.deployment?.latestStatus?.type !== 'ok') {
      // let the user decide whether to allow updates from an instable state, e.g. with:
      if(!confirm('The deployment is not in a stable state. Do you want to update anyway?')) {
          return;
      }
  }
  if(result.outdated) {
      if(customerHasAutoUpdatesEnabled) {
          await service.updateDeployment({deploymentTargetId});
          // notify customer about the update
      } else {
          const newerVersionsAvailable = result.newerVersions;
          // notify customer about the newer versions, e.g. via email
      }
  }



With the SDK/API, you can:
- Display real-time deployed version and deployment status directly within the application, notifying customers when their deployed version is outdated.
- Allow customers to trigger updates from within your app using a simple API callIf you’re distributing software and want to streamline updates or enhance monitoring, we’d love your feedback and are here to answer any questions.Getting started is easy—just bring your Docker Compose file or Helm chart, and we’ll guide you through the rest.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Luger Carbine with firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgr5XuXfwg0</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Bgr5XuXfwg0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Luger what we have here - a hands-on with the carbine variant of the Luger series of pistols.

Most legal scholars say the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear–that people born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. But the Trump administration’s legal case is built around the idea that children born to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be excluded from birthright citizenship.

Because I still think Sublime Text holds up as a great editor.I started with Sublime Text 2 back in 2010/2011 while I was in college. I mainly started using it because it was free, cross-platform, and came as a "portable app" that I could put on a USB and just use.Back then, I had a really basic Toshiba laptop that dual booted Windows XP and Ubuntu (or maybe it was Mint?) so it was nice that it worked on both. I really liked how snappy it was compared to the tools our teacher suggested using. At that time it was Dreamweaver and maybe Notepad++.Sublime, at that time, was pretty novel. It clearly took a lot of inspirations from TextMate, another classic editor, considering that one is 4 years older than Sublime. It had multiple cursors, plugins, a build system. But the biggest claim to fame for Sublime, was the "command palette". I'm sure there is some other older app that had a precursor or similar feature to it, but generally speaking, it seems like that user experience pattern really kicked off with Sublime.I built my web-dev chops on Sublime. The shortcuts are ingrained in my bones at this point. I'm not some key-combo-king, but I know a lot of the shortcuts that can help me get the UI and commands I need without thinking much at all.I have been, and continue to be, a Sublime user of about 15 years.So take all this with that in mind. I have been, and continue to be, a Sublime user of about 15 years.So why do I keep using Sublime?If you thought Sublime was dead, well you couldn't be more wrong! The latest build of Sublime as of this post is "4192" and was released 20th January 2025. So basically a week ago from this post. Not too bad.It has regularly been updated with minor tweaks and fixes about a dozen times a year. I think the last major upgrade would be when Package Control (the plugin installer/manager) bumped to the next version which allowed plugins to install external dependencies.You can nitpick here and say that Package Control is not part of Sublime. But most people won't use Sublime without it. So I am going to take some liberties and say it is part of it.I think the thing to consider is how Sublime is basically "done" software. It has been around a  time. It was first released around 2008. It just passed it's 17-year anniversary actually. Congrats to them!Before I dive into the details of  I still use it, consider this: if you are using a modern GUI-driven editor, it probably has taken inspiration from Sublime. So why not check out one of the OGs? You might find something you like.Without further adieu, my reasons for still using Sublime in 2025:Sublime is fast. It starts instantly. Uses very few resources. Handles large files gracefully. Rarely crashes.Nothing else to add here. A+ performance.Sublime LSP is really doing a lot for Sublime to keep it feeling modern and keeping up with other tools in the same class.If you aren't aware of what an LSP is, this isn't the post to learn about it. But the gist is, it handles all that fancy code-aware completion and hover info you like from VS Code. If you want to learn more give TJ 5 minutes to learn you.Some of the cool things about the Sublime LSP:Multiple servers per fileYou can enable as many LSP servers per file that you want. Restart them individually and configure them on a per-project basis (more on that later) which really helps bolster the capabilities of this already great editor.Detection on a scope levelWhen configuring an LSP, outside of one installed with a plugin, you tell the LSP plugin which "scope" (think of this as an id for a syntax) to enable an LSP on.Want your LSP to only turn on if you only open a file with a specific syntax? No problem. Want it to turn on only if a type of syntax is detected? Like a specific flavour of CSS? Sure. It is very configurable.I know VS Code is the LSP king, which the tech originating with that editor, but I haven't seen the ability to just add an LSP installed as a binary in on your .There are a few "cutting-edge" LSPs that are installed via Cargo that are usually only targeting Neovim, but can easily be configured in Sublime with a simple JSON object.Here is an example of configuring md-lsp (Markdown language server with support for GitHub flavored Markdown) in a few lines:It should be noted that md-lsp does not have a Sublime LSP plugin nor any mention of Sublime in their README. They only mention support for  and . Well, guess what? You support Sublime too!I write a lot of snippets. Right now, my snippets folder in Sublime has 123 snippets. The latest one was added . It was a "TODO" snippet for Blade.Sublime lets you create snippets from the Tools > Developer > New Snippet dropdown. They get sent to your "User" folder in the Sublime directory and are sourced on startup.Snippets are also scope-based. VS Code has scopes too, so there is nothing new here. I wonder where they got that from? 😮A quick note on scopes: they can be very vague (like , targeting a whole  file) or super specific (like text.html.basic.liquid text.html.basic meta.object.liquid which targets a nested object in a liquid template) based on what you need.I have found the Sublime scope integration to be straightforward to understand. A syntax defines scopes, and you can target those scopes in snippets, keybindings, and macros. More on those other two later.I'm sure I didn't get the details perfect. But it doesn't really matter given the point I'm going to make: not all snippet systems work this way.Specifically, I have found Helix, Neovim, and Zed snippets to be more based around "filetype" and not the scope of the where you are in the "syntax".I'm sure this will change. Or perhaps I've missed something. From what I can see on the surface, snippets based on syntax-specific scopes seem to be the default in VS Code and Sublime.Tab stops with nesting, placeholders, and referencesHere is the snippet I made today:Pretty simple. People who have written snippets before will recognize the syntax. The  is where your caret is sent first, you can then type, then hit tab, and you get sent to .Here is a TODO snippet I have for "javascript" files:Here you can see that the first tab stop has default content of "this is my todo". Here you can see a more complex scope setup that only expands this snippet under those conditions. Nothing really spectacular here.But snippets in Sublime also support some transformations...Transformations (Vue component)Here is a much more complicated snippet:This snippet has some transformations in it. This means we can actually format what the content in the different tab stops will be.I won't harp on what is going on too much. Just know that I can format the content in the "Usage" comment as  and I can format the content in  to be . VS Code can do this. The syntax for it is a bit nicer. But I prefer authoring snippets in XML rather than JSON.Sublime supports the concept of workspaces under the banner of a "project". All without a plugin, by the way. You can open a folder and save that folder as a project.This creates an empty your-project-name.sublime-project which you can really save wherever you like in your project as it has some features to target where the root of the project is.This file is just a JSON file and contains editor settings that you are overriding for that specific project. You can target global settings, set rules for specific folders, create a build system, tweak/toggle LSP settings, etc. etc.This is a lot like the  file from what I understand. I also believe you can do this in Vim with a  folder in the root of your project with a feature called "exrc". I haven't used it personally, so I can't speak to it much.In my brief flirtations with Neovim and Helix, you need a plugin for this. In Zed, they also have a settings file that can be saved into a project root to get the same thing.Including/excluding files and foldersI think all the editors I referenced above can do this. Not much to share. It is just nice to have an array of file configurations for a project that may or not be in that directory, can be matched with a glob, or just listed explicitly.Here is an example of how I would use the project file in a Next.js site:I'm doing a lot here. Setting files to ignore, folders to exclude from indexing, setting build commands that use  as well as , setting from editor setting for tab spacing, and finally a few LSP tweaks that make sense for a Next project.VS Code can do all of what I've listed here. But they split it up into different files. Kinda annoying.Configure plugin settings per projectYou can also configure plugin settings per project. Here is how I would add project settings for the "syntax override" plugin. This plugin forces the editor to use a specific syntax for certain files that match a given pattern:I don't always want all  files to be highlighted with the Tailwind syntax. But in this project I do. So I can set it locally here, and when I open a  file in this project, it will switch the syntax for me. Nice!Add build systems per projectYou can see in the example above that I have set build systems on this specific project. You can do this in VS Code with "tasks". Zed has this feature as well and calls it "tasks" too. I just find it annoying that they are in their own files. I guess that makes them more portable.I just like my project configuration . I must be nuts.I've touched on build systems a bit already. But in summation, they are just tasks you can run in your project.Sometimes they call a global command (like ), sometimes a local dependency is installed with a package manager (think some binary in ), or maybe just runs a command already setup in your other tools (like  or php artisan migrate:fresh) that run in the root of the project but need some context.Can also be provided by a pluginA plugin can provide build systems. The neat thing is they are just Sublime files. JSON that ends in . Like snippets. So they are really portable too. Just like the other editors with their  file.Here is one I saved in my "User" directory called dot-env-linter.sublime-build:You can see there are some special variables (like ) that will expand based on context. In this case, that one is the full path to the currently active file.Here is my  with a bit more flavour:You can see some more vars here for the project path as well as a reference to my system PATH. Of course, we got a nice lil scope as well.You don't even need to make any semblance of a plugin. You can toss a  file in your "User" directory and implement a class that takes a sublime_plugin.WindowCommand.Yep. Multiple cursors. I use them all the time. I know that the "vim" way is to start recording a macro, apply the changes on a single line, and then replay that macro on all the lines you want to change. Or do some  fu for a fancy find and replace. I get it. I just don't like it.Most of the editors these days have multiple cursors. Including some terminal editors like Helix. I have tried Helix and I think it is a lot closer to what I would want from a modern editor than my previous terminal editor of Neovim + LazyVim.The key and mouse bindings are what you would expect from a modern editor. It is basically the same as VS Code. Nothing exhilarating here. But I do like the way conceptual key bindings are handled.Like any good editor, Sublime supports contextual key bindings.When you have an active selection, and that selection is not empty, and you are inside a string-like scope, then ` will wrap that selection with `. Basically, it will wrap your selection as a template string. Handy!Like the build systems and snippets, key bindings are just saved in a file that ends with . They can be in your "User" directory or in a plugin. Unfortunately, unlike build systems, they cannot be saved on a per-project basis - from what I can tell.You can also have key bindings for different platforms. They are named as follows:These are just some notable mentions of things I like:Given how Python is probably the most popular language, at least the last time GitHub checked, I'm surprised this isn't the go-to editor. I don't think you need to know python to use Sublime but it helps if you want to craft a nice plugin.One more thing to add around authoring plugins, they are super simple. It is just a  file in a folder. No build system, external dependencies, or ever-changing APIs to navigate.This plugin has been trucking along for 11 years. I can't imagine any VS Code plugin lasting that long!Yep you can record macros in Sublime. You can also save them to... a file! Then put that file () in a plugin, or, of course, your "User" folder. The macro is just an array of key presses. They also support scopes and can be bound to a key combo. Pretty sweet.This is one feature that VS Code has not stolen - I mean implemented - and that requires an additional plugin to have. Of course the Vimmers have had this for decades.Diff hunks (revert or show)Sublime supports viewing inline diff hunks. Handy for when you don't want to dive into the diff of a file. You can just ask to see the diff hunk for that line or group of lines. You can also revert just as easily.Case conversion and line permute functionsThere are some handy case conversion functions that are built in. Nice with multiple cursors. VS Code has a couple of conversion choices. Sublime has 8 different case conversions built in.Package control and repo URLs for packagesPackage control packages can be installed from the central repository. But you can also install them from a git repo URL. You can also clone a repo to your "Packages" folder, and it will work too. No marketplace or anything like that is required.This is really handy if you have forked a package and just want to install your fork.All the config and settings are plain filesSince the whole of a Sublime setup is mostly plain files, that makes it really easy to sync your setup across multiple computers. I actually symlink my Sublime folder to Dropbox. So any changes I make will be shared across all my computers that use it.This isn't unique to Sublime. I think it is just a benefit of having tools that use plain text-driven configuration.Sublime has a "distraction free mode" which will full-screen your editor and focus the content to the middle of the screen. I am using it to write this post right now!Of course there could be a few things that could be better.I do find the docs for developing plugins to be sparse. There are doc sites. There are two big ones. One for the "official" docs that document the APIs. There is also another site that is tagged as the "unofficial" docs.Usually when I want to know how to do something in a plugin, I just read the source of another plugin that does something I want to emulate. It isn't a bad way to learn, it is just a bit tedious.Speaking of building plugins, there does not seem to be any "stubs" for the Sublime python API. I am by no means a python guru. I only use it in Sublime, and I usually forget everything once I finish what I am trying to do. But I think there could be some "plugin starter template" that could include a Pyright setup and some basic guide for how to get going.I also find that getting plugins on the Package Control site to be quite a chore. You need to open a PR to a repo and put your repo into a list based on where it goes into an alphabet. It doesn't allow forks and plugins that are too similar. There is also no way to mark a package as "abandoned".I like the way Composer/Packagist does packages. You create a repo, submit that URL to the Packagist site, and it will automatically keep track of it for you. You release a new version by just using git tags and releases.NPM is also a bit nicer. But forcing an NPM account and having to juggle the mixing of git tags and the  "version" key to be a bit unclear at times.Key/Mouse bindings per projectSimple one here. It would be nice to have key and mouse bindings on a project level. I don't know how often I would really use it, but it would be nice to have just for those projects that have tedious tasks or macros that I want to run under specific scopes.I like Sublime. I think it is still incredibly capable in 2025. If you are in search of something a little snappier, classier, and not riddled with AI slop, then give it a try.I doubt I can pry your Vim from your  riddled right hand, but if you have been let down or uninspired by the latest offerings when it comes to editors, you might find Sublime still has a lot to offer.Note: if any of my information is wrong or outdated, I will update it accordingly]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Science YouTuber physicsgirl (Dianna Cowern) stands for the first time in 2 yrs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2ntx91cOYEc</link><author>m348e912</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 06:16:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI says it has evidence DeepSeek used its model to train competitor</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6</link><author>timsuchanek</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 04:21:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Great Migrations with Henry Louis Gates, Jr. | Full Episode 1 | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8rtuX4M6OA</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J8rtuX4M6OA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 02:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Official website: https://to.pbs.org/4hthArc | #GreatMigrationsPBS

1720 was a year of two bubbles and a plague.  The bubbles were the Mississippi Company in France –and the South Sea Bubble in England. In September 1720 - when the bubble burst, England was plunged into an economic and political crisis. This was one of the first examples of a financial boom and bust and was the event that gave rise to the use of the term bubble to describe a spectacular market failure.

This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. Sniper Elite: Resistance reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu.Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like other games in the series, it can be played in first-person when you're aiming. The series has made a name for itself on a deep ballistic physics model that accounts for wind, bullet drop, and positioning, as well as its cherry on top: the X-ray killcam. This feature shows you, in slow-motion, how each bullet shreds Nazis in grotesque detail, inside and out. Like in other Sniper Elite games, a well-placed bullet can shoot their eyes out, explode their hearts, or even obliterate their testicles, among other special displays of sharpshooting.Like its predecessors, the game is a fun and reliable shooter when it comes to sniping mechanics, though I've grown weary of the killcam. These days, I more often skip the killcam, or at least adjust my settings to see fewer headhunting highlight reels. I get it by now; it's neat tech, but they add up over the course of a mission, which already tend to take me about two hours each, because I'm much more interested in stealthily completing my missions than watching the highlight reels of long-range vivisections.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple chips can be hacked to leak secrets from Gmail, iCloud, and more</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-M3-chip-series_screen-1152x648.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:56:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple-designed chips powering Macs, iPhones, and iPads contain two newly discovered vulnerabilities that leak credit card information, locations, and other sensitive data from the Chrome and Safari browsers as they visit sites such as iCloud Calendar, Google Maps, and Proton Mail.The vulnerabilities, affecting the CPUs in later generations of Apple A- and M-series chip sets, open them to side channel attacks, a class of exploit that infers secrets by measuring manifestations such as timing, sound, and power consumption.

Why was there more matter than antimatter left over? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the quantum origins of the universe, charge parity violation, dark matter, and the many quarks that make up our world with CERN particle physicist Harry Cliff. 

We take a look at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and his work in studying b quarks (or “beauty quarks”) and sifting through mountains of data to identify new phenomena. We break down the 17 known fundamental particles—including six quarks, three electron-like particles, and three neutrinos. What particles are yet to be uncovered? Could that be the answer to dark matter?

As we dive into the early universe, we explore how matter and antimatter formed in nearly equal amounts, only for matter to triumph in a cosmic imbalance. What conditions created this asymmetry? We discuss CP violation and the other laws of nature that the universe may have broken to create itself. 

Harry also dives into the lifespan of particles, from the fleeting existence of most, to the surprising stability of protons and electrons. Learn how particle discoveries evolved, from Henri Becquerel’s observation of radioactivity to Karl Anderson’s discovery of antimatter in cosmic rays. We also explore how Einstein’s theory of relativity applies to particle accelerators, where particles moving near light speed experience time differently. Could these machines create a micro black hole? Harry explains why media fears of “destroying the universe” are unfounded and why the cosmos has been conducting such experiments for billions of years.

Finally, we tackle questions about dark matter, its presence in everyday life, and the hypothetical tachyons that could travel faster than light. Through it all, Harry sheds light on the quantum fields underpinning reality, revealing how particles are ripples in these invisible forces. With insights from his books, How to Make an Apple Pie from Scratch and Space Oddities, Harry guides us through the thrilling world of particle physics, showing how much we’ve learned—and how much more there is to discover.

										Virtually all modern CPUs use a performance optimization where they predict the
										control flow the CPU should take (such as branches and returns), should the
										outcome not be readily available. Once a prediction is made, the CPU will execute instructions along
										the prediction, a process called speculative execution. If the CPU realizes it had
										mispredicted, it must revert all changes in the state it performed after the
										prediction. Nearly all desktop and mobile CPUs exhibit this behavior, regardless of
										manufacturer (such as Apple, AMD, or Intel).
									Spectre is a hardware vulnerability in
										virtually all modern CPUs that occurs when speculative execution backfires.
										While the CPU should ideally revert all changes in state, speculative execution leaves
										traces in the CPU's microarchitectural state and especially the cache. A Spectre
										attack coerces the CPU into speculatively executing the wrong flow of
										instructions. If this wrong flow has instructions depending on sensitive data, their value can
										be inferred through a side channel even after the CPU realizes the mistake and
										reverts its changes. An adversary can abuse this behavior to read data that they cannot
										normally access through program semantics. Because speculative execution is an
										important part of CPU performance that is infeasible to simply remove as a
										countermeasure, Spectre continues to be dangerous to software even years after
										its discovery.
									
										In SLAP and FLOP, we demonstrate that recent Apple CPUs go beyond this, not only
										predicting the control flow the CPU should take, but also the data flow the CPU
										should operate on if data are not readily available from the memory subsystem.
										Unlike Spectre, mispredictions on data flow do not directly result in the CPU
										speculatively executing the wrong instructions. Instead, they result in the CPU
										executing arbitrary instructions on the wrong data. However, we show this can be combined with
										indirection techniques to execute wrong instructions.

Two American Samoans share their opposing viewpoints: a traditional chief who wants to maintain the status quo and a U.S. Marine veteran who believes in the right to citizenship for his people. Both perspectives bring forward questions about American Samoans’ relationship to land, family, and identity.

--

As of 2022, humans have deforested 17% of the Amazon, and scientists warn that we may be approaching a tipping point. It’s like removing bricks from a house: take a few and the house remains standing; remove too many and the whole thing will collapse. So, what would happen if the entire Amazon disappeared? Anna Rothschild explores the relationship between this ecosystem and the rest of the planet.

This has prompted comparisons to a famous archeological site where behavior is similarly well preserved: the site of Pompeii, a town crystallized by volcanic eruption almost 2000 years ago.  But when you look into the details, it turns out their residents may have experienced very different final moments.

Since then, I’ve been gradually working on a CAD model for a new set of what started as (yet another) subwoofer, but became some compact 2-way office ribbon speakers.The idea was to create a fully parametric design that could be easily adapted to any drivers, enclosure volume etc – yet still retain the original aesthetic.OpenSCAD is my CAD package of choice – it’s a code-CAD system so I’m right at home. There are, however limitations which make certain things excessively hard or long-winded; even impossible!With this project, I wanted to push the boundaries of what is possible with OpenSCAD and what I could make in my garage. I wanted these speakers to look like they could have been bought from a high-end audio store.I didn’t want a simple box like most speakers. Moving toward more higher-end speakers, more exotic shapes are used – often with compound curves and automotive grade finishes.For a while the design was for a custom modelled bass-reflex subwoofer, but I decided to make some 2-way speakers after taking a look at Paul Carmody’s Speedster design; I was more excited about the idea of building a pair of full-range speakers considering I had already build a sizeable subwoofer. So, I decided to build some Speedsters instead.For about 6 years I had some Mission SX2 speakers. They were finished in piano black and were curvy – I wondered how the complicated-looking shape was made.As it turns out, each curve was just a circular arc – the complexity came from the intersection of these arcs at the edges – elegant!I also had some old Sony speakers with a flat conical profile at the front. I figured this would work well with the speedster design, considering the tweeter is inset somewhat.I decided I’d like to lean into the compound curve idea a bit more – elongate the design, move the center of the main curve forward, and pitch the top up towards the back for a kind of forced perspective.I mocked up the shape by intersecting 5 cylinders – one for each panel except the bottom. Moving around, I deviated from the SX2 design by moving the center of the side curves to the front, and angling the top for a slight incline.After some time I realised I could optimise the design quite a bit by intersecting 4 circles instead, and then extruding to intersect with a single cylinder. This, and setting the number of faces () throughout the design reduced the eventual build time to 3 minutes instead of around an hour.The extrusion approach also allowed me to use  to round the sharp edges of some of the panels. As it’s OpenSCAD, I couldn’t round the other edges – these would have to be rounded later by sanding as a post-process.In the above image, you can see the derivation of the curve of the left panel – using an offset, large circle.Given I intended to subtractively mill the design from 18mm MDF or birch ply, I had to convert the shape into a series of panels with no overhangs. The approach I used was simple – to intersect an “infinite” panel with the edges of the basic shape, and subtract the adjacent panels from each.This approach is illustrated above. From the combination intersection, you can see how 2 possible side and rear panel sizes could be derived – the rear could be wider and extend to the sides, or the side panels could be longer and extend to the rear.The side panel intersections were the most tricky as they had to be at an angle and offset determined by the centre of the circle defining the curve as well as the depth. This was necessary to ensure the panel was of even thickness on both sides.Given the design was not a simple box, I needed a way of arriving at the same internal volume as the box design. I used a similar method to calculate the shape of the internal volume, and then used admesh to measure the volume of the shape. It was then a simple matter of iterating on the depth until the volume matched the box design. Note that I kept the front panel the same size – this is important for the acoustic design as the baffle step affects the frequency response.I wonder if my design (vs a box) is acoustically superior in one way: thanks to the curved design, there are no parallel surfaces – this could reduce standing waves and resonances.Beyond this, a disclaimer – I know I’m modifying the original design which is something Mr. Carmody warns against. I think I’m being sensible though!I made a generalised negative cut-out to support any circular driver. The design accepts the panel thickness, driver inset, bezel thickness etc. It also supports either a conical or rounded flare for when the driver is inset.On the reverse of the front panel, a chamfer is added to reduce turbulence behind the driver. See this article for more information – it’s important!I thought a long time about how I would construct the design. Most importantly, how would I align and clamp the panels for gluing?I considered using dowels, brad nails, clamps and jigs. I remembered my horn-loaded subwoofer and how I used screws to align and clamp the panels as recommended in the design; it worked excellently!  I could manufacture pre-determined holes with a calibrated profile, I could use regular cabinet screws to allow fast assembly with no clamps at all.One downside is that I would have fill the resulting holes; a good compromise in my opinion. Another is that depending on how I manufacture the panels, it may be difficult to get accurate holes.Most of the design was implicit, meaning I didn’t actually know the specific co-ordinates of a lot of the features such as most of the geometry of the rear panel. This was fine, except for placing screw holes.For a long time the design had some “guesses” with hard-coded offsets to determine he position of the screw holes. This is because there’s no way of addressing a corner, edge or surface in openscad – it’s CSG only and not a BREP system.This meant that for a truly parametric and fully qualified design, I’d have to derive the locations manually. I won’t go into detail but it was basic trigonometry, just a lot of it.I used some simple techniques to align the screw holes – placing debugging cylinders at the calculated positions to check they were correct, using the orthogonal view aligned to a plane to validate the positions.The crossover in the speedster design is a fairly complex (and therefore bulky and inefficient) third-order design. This would make it a pain to manually construct in a reproducible manner, so I wanted to create a PCB for this purpose.Luckily, Greg Ose had kindly designed one on github. It was fairly large as it was designed to accommodate variety of possible inductor/capacitor/resistor sizes – not a problem on a rectangular speedster design but a little challenging to fit inside my design.In the end I designed an access panel at the bottom of the speaker to allow easy installation of the crossover. This was a lot of effort but worth it – what if I had sealed in the crossover and it developed a fault?DownloadCopyThe above is the algorithm set to calculate the right number of screws to achieve a minimum space between each, and then fit them evenly.The design held the crossover together with 20mm standoffs, attached to the access panel in a vertical orientation.To properly seal the speaker drivers, rear connectors and access panel, I had to find some kind of gasket material. It’s possible to buy foam tape, but that seemed quite messy.I thought the best way would be to manufacture the gaskets to be the perfect shape, complete with bolt holes. I first experimented with a 3D printed design using TPU filament, but the resulting gaskets felt too hard and I didn’t think it would seal well.In the end I found some 1mm self-adhesive EVA foam. If I could get some time with a laser cutter I could make them easily and get a great seal!Nesting & post processingI like the idea of a fully automated build chain; in addition to being full parametric, my design produces renders of all the parts, optimised STLs and even places the parts on individual beds/plates.This was more necessary when I was targeting CAMBAM or PyCAM, which are quite basic so don’t include the ability to automatically place parts. Iterating the design would involve a lot of manual placement and check steps if I didn’t automate this process!I combined rectpack with numpy-stl to produce a script that not only nests parts, but also places the parts on the minimum number of beds. Given the opportunity, it also bounds checks the result and places the parts down flat to ensure it is manufacturable on a given machine.As the design was fully parametric, I could change a single variable to move to a floorstanding design. Of course the acoustic design would have to change, but this makes it easy to experiment with different designs create variants with far less effort.All of the panels and screw positions are recalculated to fit the new dimensions. I would probably have to break up the design into sections and add more braces to make a floorstander feasible though.As detailed in my OpenSCAD article, the Makefile for the project produces some crisp looking renders.The above shows how the panels are assembled. Below, all panels.I had designed the speaker to be manufactured using a CNC router. I had access to one via a friend – we spent a whole year of Wednesday evenings getting it to work, ultimately to conclude that the Mach3 based controller was a dead-end – too unreliable. We had plans on building a new machine, but that plan got put on hold due to work commitments from us both.One day I had a realisation – the speaker could probably be printed using my X1 Carbon as the build plate was nearly as big as the speaker was tall; perhaps I could divide up a panel or something…As it turns out, I could, without even dividing any panels. I did this by making the speaker wider, shallower and shorter; as well as changing the bottom panel to take up some height from the side panels. Literally millimeters made the difference!Given this marginal fit, the nesting system I developed was less useful, especially considering bambu slicer can do it better natively. The script was still useful for bounds checks and to give an initial go at layout.PLA was my natural choice. It’s the easiest to print with, and given the speakers won’t be left in the sun outside I think the relatively low temperature tolerance won’t be an issue.The density of MDF is around 500kg/m^3 versus PLA at around 1240kg/m^3. So this means I could print at 50% infill and exceed the density of MDF.First I tried 90% infill. It did not go well. There was terrible curling with the default settings with the X1 carbon; unacceptable! I reduced to infill to 50% which helped – less plastic, less shrinkage in theory.I attempted to improve bed adhesion by cleaning the plate with isopropyl alcohol and spraying it with hairspray. This helped, but the part ended up pulling the bed up with it…I took a look at the settings. As it turns out, the plate is called a “cool plate” for a reason! The default settings leave it at 35c, which is far less than the 60c I used to use with my old printer (a janky Anet A8).Whacking up the temperature fixed the problem entirely – only after wasting about 3 spools messing around. Luckily I got a deal on some cheap PLA – £10 a reel from “TECHBEARS” – a company I’ve never heard of. Not issues though, beyond the original curling.Before I knew it I had printed all 18 parts. It took about a week of constant printing. Having the AMS unit really helped, as it automatically moved to the next spool.Heat-set brass inserts that have knurled edges are commonly available. They are generally pushed in with a soldering iron, and secure themselves in the plastic as they cool. They are an alternative to making a thread, using loose nuts or standoffs.Generally the inserts have a shank and a protruding lip at the top an bottom. I experimented quite a bit with the size of the hole; what I found was:If you get it to small, the plastic builds up and the insert wandersIf you get it too big, the insert doesn’t grip as well and can fall outUse a pair of tweezers to steer the insert so it ends up straightBe ready to hold the insert with the tweezers in case the soldering iron catchesA balance between the two is necessary. I found about halfway between the two diameters was optimal. Any squeeze-out can be removed with a narrow drill bit and hammer.A test fit showed that everything fit well, which was a relief as I didn’t allow any margin in most cases. Some bolts were a bit tight on the access panel, that’s it.I decided to use epoxy glue to assemble the parts – cyanocrylate would have worked, but may not have sealed the edges as well. It is important to make sure there are no air leaks which would compromise the acoustic performance.I keyed in the surfaces using some 40 grit sandpaper to aid adhesion – little effort was required. I cleaned the surfaces with isopropyl alcohol – important to remove any oils and more importantly hairspray residue from the 3D printing process.The screws were perfect for aligning and clamping the panels, removing process variance. I used plasterboard screws as they’re cheap and I have thousands of them. I designed a calibration part to prevent any movement, and to ensure no expansion of the substrate plastic with appropriate tightness. The calibration part also served as a mechanism to measure the compressed foam depth with several layers divided for increased accuracy.Assembling the panels in the following order made sure every part was fully constrained and easy to align:Surprisingly, I used only one 25ml “Gorilla glue” Epoxy syringe – there was exactly the right amount for both speakers! I had no idea how much I’d need.It was important to me to make sure the final result didn’t  3D printed. As such, I needed a smooth finish without showing any joins or layer lines.To achieve this I used my random orbital sander with 60, then 120 grit – making sure to use low speed as the PLA can melt easily and burrs will form everywhere. I also made sure to avoid over-rounding the edges and particularly corners – one slip and they’re done for!I rounded the sharp edges that I couldn’t round in the design with 120 grit sandpaper by hand. I also did the bass port by hand, which was a pain until I found a tube to wrap the sandpaper around.After this I used “Big boy” 2-part fine surface filler after a quick wipe with isopropyl alcohol. I reckon about a 3 golf ball sized blobs are sufficient per speaker – it cures quickly so don’t use too much at once, and limit the activator. I reckon 15mm of activator was enough per golf ball sized blob.The consistency was that of margarine at first, but within minutes it became like hard-to-push plasticine. I used the included plastic scraper to push it around and fill the screw holes.Given it cured so quickly, the above was the result. A bit of a mess, but it didn’t matter – it just meant more sanding.After sanding with 240 grit, the result was starting to feel smooth – no layer lines to be felt at all. I did, however, notice some of the screw holes had pitting so I had to iterate a few times. It was only some time after that I realised the pitting was probably caused by sanding dust getting into the filler – I should have cleaned the surface first with air or water!Next I gave the cabinets another clean with isopropyl alcohol to remove any grease before taking them to the spray tent (which was really a beach tent) and masking the brass inserts.I put some long woodscrews in the feet holes to act as a stand. This worked well, and allowed me to spray each cabinet in one go by holding the cabinets by the braces. I sprayed on a few layers of adhesion promoter and left them overnight in the kitchen where it was warm.After this I sprayed the cabinets with 3 coats of black primer. In retrospect, I should have used plastic primer but it seemed to work well. I followed the primer with some Hicote bed liner – a thick, textured paint that is supposed to be durable.A word of warning – the bed liner gets everywhere! I left the parts to cure overnight in the kitchen.After curing the speakers looked fantastic – you couldn’t see the panel joins at all! A little texture and a few screw holes were visible though; I could have taken more time to deal with them but I only have finite patience…I ended up getting a great deal on a Creality Falcon 10W CR-Laser cutter in the end, after asking around to see who had access to a cutter.With lightburn, I was able to cut the gaskets out of 1mm EVA foam straight away after minimal experimentation. It’s a great bit of kit – 10W is a lot of power for foam. I reckon the 5W one would have worked just as well (albeit slower).I was able to run at 10,000mm/min at 80% power in a single pass. That meant cutting time was reduced too well under a minute.The gaskets fitted well, despite being a little fiddly. The speaker drivers were fine, though the bolts were tight due to the brass inserts being slightly off.I was happy to see that my experiment with the foam thickness resulted in the drivers fitting correctly.When fitting the crossover I found the speaker wire I had didn’t take to solder well at all. Substituting for some mains flex, I had no problems.Before closing I put a “couple of handfuls” of polyester stuffing inside, making sure to get all empty space. This increases the apparent volume of the speaker. https://pypi.org/project/numpy-stl/I measured directly instead of trusting the driver datasheets I measured the response at near field (using room EQ wizard) to make sure the polarity of the drivers (with respect to each other and left/right) are correct – else I could unknowingly end up with a notch in the crossover frequency – or worse, cancel bass between the speakers. I have a calibrated measurement mic for this.I have read that the Foundtek ribbon driver can have reversed polarity sometimes in forums. It’s also possible that the crossover design or my wiring could have a mistake.According to the original speedster design, the crossover should be around the 3000Hz region. We should not see a dip at this frequency – if we do, it’s likely the drivers are out of phase. They should be pushing and pulling at the same time around this crossover point.The above shows a dip at 3.5kHz – the drivers could be out of phase. I swapped the polarity of one of the tweeters to see what it did to the response.As it turns out, swapping the polarity of the tweeter fixed the dip! The response above is much smoother. I’m glad I checked it!A friend pointed out the peak at around 70Hz and suggested it could be a room mode. Plugging the numbers into this generator seemed to confirm it! I shall use Room EQ Wizard and something like CamillaDSP should I feel the need to correct it. Not sure I can justify another MiniDSP.Note that I was using my Sony amplifier and could not turn off the DBFB feature, so the plot is influenced by not only the room, noisy children, but also this feature.Later on I tried the Fosi amplifier. The large 70Hz peak was gone! This means the room mode theory was a distraction; the cause was the DBFB feature of the Sony amplifier.However, a few comments on reddit suggest the roll off into the high frequencies looks bad. I agree that the measurement method wasn’t right – I am likely getting a bad reading due to acute roll-off in that position due to the dispersion of the tweeter. I will have to measure at a greater distance to get a more accurate reading.As for the polarity between the speakers, I generated a 60Hz tone and checked that the SPL increased when driving both speakers at once. Much like when setting the phase of a subwoofer, the SPL in the listening position should increase when the speakers are in phase. It did!UMIK-1 – and several others for some reason. I was surprised at how neat the speakers looked. They didn’t look “DIY” which was one of my aims.If I were to make them again, I’d make sure the screw holes were properly filled, and use more filler elsewhere as it’s possible to see the 3D printed texture and screw holes in some places with the right light.I’d also make sure the bass port has enough paint – it’s a bit thin in places, but I don’t mind for now as it’s not visible during use where I’ve got it set up.Bed liner paint was a good choice – I like the even finish. Perhaps I could experiment with sanding the finish and possibly waxing it or something on a test piece.Construction & design methodI’m pleased to say the design method of creating a shape and intersecting panels, combined with clamping screws worked extremely well. There were no issues (in the end) with panel warping or accumulating errors.I was a little worried about accumulating errors, but thanks to the accuracy of the screw clamping method, decent 3D printer and viscous glue, there were no issues.Given it’s parametric I dare say I’ll make some other speakers in the future with the same design. Possibly the Virage now that I have the Paul Carmody bug.TL;DR: Great! Best speakers I’ve heard, possibly ever.First I hooked them up to my office amplifier, a 25 year old Sony. Unfortunately even at max volume they were not loud enough. The amp was clearly struggling – playing a sine wave would result in audible clipping.Why was it struggling? It has no problem driving the 6 ohm speakers it came with. The answer lies in the crossover – it’s a third order design and therefore inefficient compared to a simple first-order crossover. These speakers need power!Despite this, vocals sounded amazing and there was a surprising amount of bass – as is characteristic of the speedster design.The speakers were rather boomy in my office. I suspect this is due to the DBFB feature of the amp – bass enhancement tuned to the sony speakers it came with. Given this and the power problem, I reserved judgement until I got a proper amplifier.So what amplifier would make sense? Requirements:Small form factor, it’s on my deskEnough power to drive the speakersGood sound quality – no distortionI consulted Audio Science Review to find a suitable amplifier. The reviews here are objective and based on scientific assessment by Amid. I settled on a Fosi V3 and got a good deal.After this they sound far better. No longer boomy, and a great sound-stage. “Holographic” is the meaningless audiophile word I’d use.SINAD, SNR, FFT, THD, IMD, etc. I could design a larger set of speakers next – possibly a floorstanding design. Maybe also, I could use this design base for a SFF PC case!If I get the chance, I’d love to compare my speedsters with a set made from wood. While the density is approximately the same as MDF, the damping qualities of PLA may not be as good. This could be mitigated by the lack of parallel surfaces, however.Also I’ve been told by no less than 5 people, given we’ve converted the garage into a fitness studio for my wife’s PT business, I have to build a new workshop in the garden for future projects…Instigated mainly by Oliver, who owns the DIY CNC router. I say, Oliver, I will, as soon as you build your new CNC machine! Thanks to Paul Carmody for the original speedster design, Greg Ose for the crossover PCBs.Please email me with any corrections or feedback.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tap into Fast Flow w/ Team Topologies &amp; Platform Engineering • Manuel Pais &amp; Julian Wood • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBxV3Cr0lXY</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hBxV3Cr0lXY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 13:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOunscripted

But in many real-time systems, the server needs to talk first and more often.This is where  and  come into play—two popular methods for achieving real-time updates.In this article, we’ll explore these two techniques, how they work, their pros and cons, and use cases.HTTP, the backbone of the web, follows a :The client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request to the server.The server processes the request and sends back a response.This model is simple and works for many use-cases, but it has limitations: With plain HTTP, the server cannot proactively push data to the client. The client has to request the data periodically. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request stands alone with no persistent connection to the server. This can be problematic if you need continuous exchange of data.To build truly real-time features—live chat, financial tickers, or gaming updates—you need a mechanism where the server can instantly notify the client when something changes. is a technique that mimics real-time behavior by keeping HTTP requests open until the server has data.Long Polling is an enhancement over traditional polling. In regular polling, the client repeatedly sends requests at fixed intervals (e.g., every second) to check for updates. This can be wasteful if no new data exists. Long Polling tweaks this approach: the client asks the server for data and then “waits” until the server has something new to return or until a timeout occurs.How Does Long Polling Work? to the server, expecting new data.Server holds the request open until it has an update or a timeout is reached.If there's new data, the server immediately responds.If there’s no new data and the timeout is reached, the server responds with an empty or minimal message.Once the client receives a response—new data or a timeout—it immediately sends a new request to the server to keep the connection loop going.Simple to implement (uses standard HTTP).Supported universally since it uses standard HTTP, and it works reliably through firewalls and proxies.Higher latency after each update (client must re-establish connection).Resource-heavy on servers (many open hanging requests).Simple chat or comment systems where real-time but slightly delayed updates (near real-time) are acceptable.Notification systems for less frequent updates (e.g., Gmail’s "new email" alert).Legacy systems where WebSockets aren’t feasible.Code Example (JavaScript) provide a full-duplex, persistent connection between the client and the server.Once established, both parties can send data to each other at any time, without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests. Client sends an HTTP request with .: If supported, the server upgrades the connection to WebSocket (switching from  to ). After the handshake, client and server keep a TCP socket open for communication.Full-Duplex Communication: Once upgraded, data can be exchanged bidirectionally in real time until either side closes the connection.Ultra-low latency (no repeated handshakes).Lower overhead since there’s only one persistent connection rather than repeated HTTP requests.Scalable for real-time applications that need to support large number of concurrent users.More complex setup (requires the client and server to support WebSocket).Some proxies and firewalls may not allow WebSocket traffic.Complexity in implementation and handling reconnections/errors.Server resource usage might grow if you have a large number of concurrent connections.Live chat and collaboration tools (Slack, Google Docs, etc.).Multiplayer online games with real-time state synchronization.Live sports/financial dashboards that need to push frequent updates.Code Example (JavaScript)Both methods achieve real-time updates, but your choice depends on your project’s requirements: is easier to implement using standard libraries. Any environment that supports HTTP can handle it, often without extra packages. require a bit more setup and a capable proxy environment (e.g., support in Nginx or HAProxy). However, many frameworks (e.g., Socket.io) simplify the process significantly.Scalability and Performance can become resource-intensive with a large number of simultaneous clients, due to multiple open connections waiting on the server side. offer a more efficient, persistent connection and scale better for heavy, frequent data streams. fits scenarios where data updates aren’t super frequent. If new data arrives every few seconds or minutes, long polling might be enough. are better for high-frequency updates or two-way communication (e.g., multiple participants editing a document or interacting in a game). typically works even in older networks or those with strict firewalls. might face issues in certain corporate or older mobile environments, though this is less of a problem as the standard becomes more widespread.While both achieve real-time communication, WebSockets are generally more efficient for truly real-time applications, while Long Polling can be simpler to implement for less demanding scenarios.1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)Allows the server to push messages to the client over HTTP.It's simpler than WebSockets for one-way communication, but not full-duplex.Best suited for use cases like news feeds, real-time notifications, and status updates.Commonly used in IoT for lightweight publish-subscribe messaging.Specialized for device-to-device or device-to-server communication with minimal overhead.3. Libraries like Socket.ioProvides an abstraction over WebSockets for easier real-time communication.Automatically falls back to long polling if WebSockets are unsupported.Ensures cross-browser compatibility with robust and reliable performance.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The project, intended to replace a 20-year-old SAP system with a SaaS-based HR and finance system, has faced multiple setbacks, renegotiated contracts, and a new systems integrator, with completion now pushed to December 2025. The Register reports: West Sussex County Council is taking advantage of the so-called "flexible use of capital receipts scheme" introduced in 2016 by the UK government to allow councils to use money from the sale of assets such as land, offices, and housing to fund projects that result in ongoing revenue savings. An example of the asset disposals that might contribute to the project -- set to see the council move off a 20-year-old SAP system -- comes from the sale of a former fire station in Horley, advertised for $3.1 million.
 
Meanwhile, the delays to the project, which began in November 2019, forced the council to renegotiate its terms with Oracle, at a cost of $3 million. The council had expected the new SaaS-based HR and finance system to go live in 2021, and signed a five-year license agreement until June 2025. The plans to go live were put back to 2023, and in the spring of 2024 delayed again until December 2025. According to council documents published this week [PDF], it has "approved the variation of the contract with Oracle Corporation UK Limited" to cover the period from June 2025 to June 2028 and an option to extend again to the period June 2028 to 2030. "The total value of the proposed variation is $2.96 million if the full term of the extension periods are taken," the council said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Flags Linux Topics As &apos;Cybersecurity Threats&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/2120230/facebook-flags-linux-topics-as-cybersecurity-threats?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook has banned posts mentioning Linux-related topics, with the popular Linux news and discussion site, DistroWatch, at the center of the controversy. Tom's Hardware reports: A post on the site claims, "Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with Linux as being 'cybersecurity threats.' We tried to post some blurb about distrowatch.com on Facebook and can confirm that it was barred with a message citing Community Standards. DistroWatch says that the Facebook ban took effect on January 19. Readers have reported difficulty posting links to the site on this social media platform. Moreover, some have told DistroWatch that their Facebook accounts have been locked or limited after sharing posts mentioning Linux topics.
 
If you're wondering if there might be something specific to DistroWatch.com, something on the site that the owners/operators perhaps don't even know about, for example, then it seems pretty safe to rule out such a possibility. Reports show that "multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed." However, we tested a few other Facebook posts with mentions of Linux, and they didn't get blocked immediately. Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has tried to appeal against the Community Standards-triggered ban. However, they say that a Facebook representative said that Linux topics would remain on the cybersecurity filter. The DistroWatch writer subsequently got their Facebook account locked... DistroWatch points out the irony at play here: "Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers." 

UPDATE: Facebook has admited they made a mistake and stopped blocking the posts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Collaborated With The Nazis During WW2?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBZZBN2RIU0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FBZZBN2RIU0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 22:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World War 2 created many impossible decisions for the people who fell victim to this all-consuming war.

Over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on open sourcing the OS! The source code for PebbleOS is now available at github.com/google/pebble. Read more on their blog.Thank you so much, Google! I can't stress how thankful I am to the individuals who did the heavy lifting. This was also made possible by the Rebble team and community, who have supported Pebble since it shut down. Check out the vibrant r/Pebble and Discord.The source code that powers each Pebble smartwatch is now freely available to download, modify and improve on Github. Want a reminder of how awesome Pebble OS is? Dive back into the beautiful, retro, pixelated world of Pebble.Anyone can use PebbleOS in any way they want. You can get it working on existing Pebble watches, emulate it, run it on other embedded devices, or create new hardware specifically for it.

Pebble’s first Kickstarter was the single most funded at the time, and its successor Kickstarter for the Pebble Time repeated that feat – and remains the second most funded today! Over the course of four years, Pebble sold over two million smartwatches, cultivating a thriving community of thousands of developers who created over ten thousand Pebble apps and watchfaces.In 2016, Fitbit acquired Pebble, including Pebble’s intellectual property. Later on, Fitbit itself was acquired by Google, taking the Pebble OS with it.Despite the Pebble hardware and software support being discontinued eight years ago, Pebble still has thousands of dedicated fans.We are releasing most of the source code for the Pebble operating system. This repository contains the entire OS, which provides all the standard smartwatch functionality – notifications, media controls, fitness tracking, and support for custom apps and watchfaces – on tiny ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Built with FreeRTOS, it contains multiple modules for memory management, graphics, and timekeeping, as well as an extensive framework to load and run custom applications written in C, as well as in Javascript via the Jerryscript Javascript engine. The Pebble architecture allowed for a lightweight system delivering a rich user experience as well as a very long battery life.It's important to note that some proprietary code was removed from this codebase, particularly for chipset support and the Bluetooth stack. This means the code being released contains all the build system files (using the waf build system), but it will not compile or link as released.From here, we are hoping this release will assist the dedicated community and volunteers from the Rebble project to carry forward the support for Pebble watches that users still love. For someone to build a new firmware update, there is a non-trivial amount of work to do in finding replacements for the pieces that were stripped out of this code, as well as updating this source code that has not been maintained for a few years.By Matthieu Jeanson, Katharine Berry, and Liam McLoughlin]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bill Gates on the Autism Spectrum: “That Became a Strength”</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgC8-mSIX1Q</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TgC8-mSIX1Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Former Microsoft CEO and philanthropist Bill Gates spoke to WSJ about a recent meeting with Donald Trump, Elon Musk’s DOGE, U.S.-China relations and his upcoming book, “Source Code,” in which he reveals new details about his childhood including his thoughts on the autism spectrum.

It's called Podcatcher and
it's live on the iOS App Store! As with mostthings I've made in the past several years, it's
implemented using a combination of Racket and Swift. This
approach continues to be a very fun and productive way for me to
write apps, and working on these projects has allowed me to refine
it further. For example, I've recently added async support to Noise
and made it compliant with Swift Concurrency while maintaining
backwards-compatibility with the existing implementation based on
s.Why a podcast player? Because I listen to podcasts a lot (like a lot,
a lot, a hundred hours a month a lot) and the podcast player I used
to use recently made some changes I didn't like, so I decided to make
an app suited to my liking and listening style. As you might expect
from a modern podcast player, it's got audio enhancements like an
equalizer that boosts voices, silence trimming, variable speed with
pitch adjustment, and a "shower mode" that boosts voices further,
trading quality for loudness when you need it. It's also free, has no
ads or tracking, and it's local-first except for the podcast directory
and sync. There is a backend component that ingests podcast feeds
periodically and sends push notifications to the app to update its local
database when new episodes get released.Compared to some of the other apps, cross-device sync via iCloud is
maybe the main thing that is currently missing, and the UI is less
fancy/custom, but that's what I prefer anyway. In a future release, I
plan to add a sleep timer, support for favorites & bookmarks and a watch
companion app. I'm also open to suggestions, so let me know what you
think if you give it a try!On the Racket and OSS side of things, the following changes directly
resulted from my work on the app, either because they were needed to
make the project work at all (i.e. some of the build changes, and the
work to support OpenSSL) or because working on the app exposed certain
problems (i.e. the performance issue with the XML library, and the
redirect issue in http-easy).Plus, the changes to Noise I mentioned earlier. I am
still debating whether or not I want to make the app itself source
available, like I've done for Franz and Remember. Maybe if there's
interest.In terms of lines of code per language, the app looks like this:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                     files          blank        comment           code

Swift                           68            621             25           6392
Racket                          73            590             42           4965

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Racket numbers include the API component, which is about 1800 lines
of code on its own, but the Racket code is a lot more dense than the
Swift code, which has only one external library dependency, compared to
the Racket core which has several:The Swift part also includes about 1.5k lines of code representing
structs and ser/de code generated by Noise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work</title><link>https://mertbulan.com/2025/01/26/once-you-are-laid-off-you-will-never-be-the-same-again/</link><author>mertbio</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 08:22:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It happened on the afternoon of May 4th. A message from a colleague—who has since become a good friend—popped up on my screen, urging me to check my emails. When I opened my inbox, there it was: an email from the COO. The email announced an impending company-wide layoff and mentioned that, within a few minutes, I’d receive another email letting me know whether I was impacted. A short while later, the second email arrived. I was among those affected—along with most of my team.The situation felt surreal. One by one, my colleagues posted in our team chat, confirming they’d been impacted too. Before our accounts were locked, we quickly jumped on a call. We had just 30 minutes to have one final conversation as a team, to say our goodbyes. It was a bittersweet moment, sharing those last words with people I’d worked so closely with.It was difficult to process what was happening. Just ten months earlier, the company had gone through another round of layoffs. And at the beginning of the year, during the company’s kick-off event, the president assured us there wouldn’t be any more layoffs. They even said the company was performing well financially. So, why was this happening?Looking back, my colleagues and I were not entirely surprised by the layoff. There were several warning signs that hinted something was coming. I want to share these signs so you can be better prepared if you ever face a similar situation.1. Cancellation of Team EventsOne of the earliest indicators was the sudden cancellation of team events. When I heard from other teams that their off-site events were canceled without any clear explanation, it immediately raised red flags. These cancellations often signal that the company is going to announce something about the team structure and doesn’t want you to be with your team in the same place. This is because one of your teammates—or you—might be impacted, and you’d need to cancel flights, hotels, etc. To avoid dealing with these logistical issues, the company preemptively cancels the event.2. Unexpected Notifications About PackagesSome employees at the company received notifications about packages scheduled to arrive at their homes. This happens because services like DHL notify you through their app when a package is on the way. If your company requires you to return your work equipment, like a laptop, after being laid off, they often arrange for these shipping boxes to be delivered in advance. If you unexpectedly see a notification about a package from your company’s IT provider, it’s a strong sign that a layoff is imminent—and you may be impacted.3. Lack of Vision from LeadershipThe absence of a clear vision from leadership is one of the most common signs of an impending layoff. During off-site or kick-off events, you might notice that leaders seem unsure of the company’s direction. When this lack of clarity is followed by team restructuring, and then another restructuring just a few months later, it becomes evident that the leadership is struggling to find focus. Ultimately, this cycle often ends with a layoff, accompanied by yet another round of restructuring for those who remain.4. Sudden, Vague MeetingsAnother sign is the appearance of unexpected, vague meetings on your calendar. These meetings are marked as “important” with no clear agenda, and attendance is mandatory. If this happens, it’s often a precursor to a layoff announcement. Public companies, in particular, may choose to send layoff notices via email to align the timing with when they notify investors.5. Timing Around Quarterly ResultsIf your company is publicly traded, layoffs are frequently announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports. This can be especially stressful because, leading up to every financial results announcement, employees may anxiously wait to see if layoffs will accompany the news. If no layoffs are announced, you know you’re safe—for at least one more quarter.When I looked back on my time at the company and all the things I had accomplished, I was surprised to be impacted by the layoffs. It wasn’t because I thought I was better than others—it was because I believed I was doing more than what was expected of me. However, during a layoff, it seems that who you are and what you do doesn’t matter. In most cases, the decision is made by people who don’t even know you. This realization made me question the concept of work, which is part of the reason I’m writing this blog post.I was hired as a Backend Developer. When I joined my team, I noticed a project that needed a developer to implement the client-side feature in React Native. Although I had no prior experience with React Native, I had worked with React before, so I volunteered for the task. I shipped the feature without any issues, received positive feedback from my team and lead, and eventually, my title was changed to Developer, making me a full-stack developer.In some instances, I worked on projects independently, always aligning with my team and ensuring my work was reviewed. I would implement the backend first and then move on to the client-side. This was my expected role, and in performance reviews, I was consistently rated as a high performer. Yet, I was always doing more than what was expected of me.Sometimes, I worked on small features I thought would enhance the app. These features might not have been used by many, but they provided significant value to heavy users. Occasionally, I shipped these under the radar. I created dashboards to measure the impact of my team’s work, helping us focus on features that would bring the most value to users. I also built proof-of-concept features based on user requests to show leadership how easily they could be implemented, advocating for their prioritization. Additionally, I participated in hackdays, creating projects to showcase innovative ideas.On several occasions, I was selected for special projects outside my team. These projects often came directly from the CEO, and I was chosen because I constantly wanted to do more for the company and our users. For some of these projects, I worked more than eight hours a day, including weekends. A few of these initiatives were mentioned in financial reports, praised by the CEO during all-hands meetings, or retweeted multiple times by the CEO on Twitter.Over time, I gained the attention of senior management in my business unit, which consisted of about 400 people. I began directly interacting with the VP of Product and the VP of Engineering, both of whom were four or five levels above me. Occasionally, the VP of Product would message me directly to ask if a feature was feasible to implement. Later, the VP of Engineering started scheduling regular one-on-one meetings with me, which was highly uncommon. During these calls, he told me multiple times that if I continued working at this level, I could quickly climb the ladder to become a Staff Developer. He wasn’t the only one saying this to me.Beyond my immediate role, I also sought ways to contribute to the broader company. Whenever a new tool was introduced, I would explore it, write detailed articles about my findings, and share them to help other teams use the tool more effectively.I referred many friends and former colleagues to the company because I believed in its mission. If I recall correctly, I referred over ten people, four of whom received offers, and three were ultimately hired. I also encouraged many others to consider joining the company.I even initiated discussions about translating our website into Turkish to support the many customers we had in Turkey. A few weeks before the layoff announcement, I was helping a team working on this project find a Turkish-speaking content designer because they noticed my willingness to assist.Additionally, I tried to convince friends who were CTOs at major e-commerce companies to migrate their websites to our platform. Whenever I received job offers from e-commerce companies on LinkedIn, I used those opportunities to promote our platform instead. I passed along leads to the sales team and later noticed that one of those companies had indeed moved to our platform.I’m not sharing all of this to brag but to highlight that, in the end, none of it mattered. On the day I announced I had been laid off, I received numerous messages from colleagues, even those I hadn’t worked with directly, telling me that I had inspired and motivated them. While those messages were heartwarming, they didn’t change the reality: to the company, I was just a row in an Excel sheet.Layoffs were uncommon when I started working, and being a developer felt like an incredibly safe job. In most professions, the unspoken rule was simple: if you performed well and the company was financially stable, your job was secure.But today, companies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead—only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn’t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I’m not sure how they could fix it.What’s particularly strange is that the layoffs predominantly affect individual contributors—the people who have little say in deciding the company’s direction. These are the team members closest to the users, the ones who spend hours planning how to improve the product. But after those plans are made, leadership often swoops in and redirects efforts toward entirely different goals. You trust their judgment, work on their priorities, and deliver on time. Then, when the arbitrary goals they set aren’t met, the company decides to cut staff. Those who made the poor decisions remain, and some are even promoted, while the people carrying out the work are let go. It feels surreal—like an episode from Silicon Valley—but this is how big companies operate.I’m not alone in feeling this way. Many friends and ex-colleagues who’ve been laid off in recent years share similar experiences. They’ve lost trust in their employers. They believe their efforts won’t matter in the long run and anticipate being part of the next layoff cycle. As a result, they only do what’s strictly required to avoid a performance improvement plan. No one goes above and beyond anymore; no one takes initiative to improve things. Why? Because it doesn’t matter. They’ve seen firsthand that it changes nothing.For those like me who’ve experienced layoffs, work has become just that—work. You do what’s assigned, and if your company squanders your potential or forces you to waste time on unnecessary projects, you simply stop caring. You collect your paycheck at the end of the month, and that’s it. This is the new modern work: no more striving to be 40% better every year.Since I was working for a German entity of a company, I want to address a common myth about job security in Germany. Many people believe that it’s nearly impossible to be fired in Germany. While this is partially true for individuals who have completed their probation period, it doesn’t hold up in the context of layoffs. If a company decides to lay off, for instance, 40 employees, German law doesn’t prevent this. Instead, the law enforces a social scoring system to determine who is affected, prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable employees, such as those with children. In this sense, when it comes to layoffs, the difference between Germany and the US is minimal.When I talk to friends who were laid off in recent years, we often reflect on what we could have done differently. Here are some of the lessons we’ve learned:Stick to your contract hours. If your contract says 40 hours, work 40 hours—no more, no less. Protect your personal time and well-being.Avoid going above and beyond with initiatives. Many companies encourage impactful work to earn promotions, but instead of chasing internal advancements, focus on switching companies to achieve your next career step.Always keep interviewing. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen is stopping interviews after starting a new job, trusting in the company. Instead, continuously explore opportunities so that if a layoff happens, you already have other options lined up.Leverage external offers for salary growth. Companies often resist giving substantial raises to existing employees but pay top dollar for new hires. Regularly interview elsewhere, and if you get an offer with a 20% or higher salary increase, consider taking it. Many people have seen their compensation triple or quadruple this way in just a few years.Don’t overthink your résumé. Worrying about short experiences on your CV isn’t worth it. You can always tailor your résumé—leave out brief roles, or consolidate short-term jobs as freelance experience. Ultimately, your résumé is just a starting point; your skills will be assessed during the interview process.You’ve probably noticed that I didn’t mention the name of the company I was laid off from. That’s because I believe it’s irrelevant. Everything I’ve shared reflects the current state of the tech industry. It might differ at very small companies, but once you work at a company with more than 100 employees, you’ll likely encounter many of the same patterns I’ve described.I’ve wanted to write about this topic for a long time, but it’s been difficult to find the energy. The subject itself is a deep disappointment for me, and every time I reflect on layoffs, it makes me profoundly sad. It’s a stark reminder of how companies treat workers as disposable. Before you join, they go to great lengths to make you feel valued and excited to accept their offer. You meet multiple people, and some even offer signing bonuses. But when layoffs come, you’re reduced to a name on a list. During the exit interview, a random person from the company reads a prepared script and can’t answer your questions. The HR team that once worked to make you feel valued doesn’t even conduct an actual conversation with you. That random person becomes the last connection you have to a company you spent years at.The layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work now. I don’t think that I’ll be the same person again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Making AR experiences is still painful – had to make my own editor</title><link>https://ordinary.space/</link><author>boriskourt</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 07:32:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[With Ordinary Objects, ideating, designing and testing  experiences is faster and more fun than ever before.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: DeepSeek My User Agent</title><link>https://www.jasonthorsness.com/20</link><author>jasonthorsness</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 22:03:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DeepSeek R1 is a new model and service that exposes

By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

"This bill aligns Michigan with a majority of the country," according to the state's announcement, which says the bill "advances technological literacy" and ensures their students "are well-equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary for success in the workforce." 
Slashdot reader theodp writes:



From the Michigan House Fiscal Agency Analysis: "Supporters of the bill say that increasing access to computer science courses for students in schools should be a priority of the state in order to ensure that students can compete for the types of jobs that have good pay and will be needed in the coming decades." 
That analysis goes on to report that testifying in favor of the bill were tech-giant backed nonprofit Code.org (Microsoft is a $30 million Code.org donor), Amazon and AWS (Amazon is a $30+ million Code.org donor), the tech-supported Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and the lobbying organization TechNet, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and OpenAI). 
It's not clear how many high schools in Michigan are already teaching CS courses, but this still raises a popular question for discussion. Should high schools be required to teach at least one CS course?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From India to Germany - Creating a new world with good food | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4z76ynr98</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fG4z76ynr98?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 17:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Running a restaurant as an Indian woman?

Wikipedia defines ACPI as "an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:

The ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could "spectacularly" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... 

Rafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: 

 "The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values." 
One 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took "a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected." In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Paul Fiddes - Mystery of the Trinity?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihx5JvcEoBg</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ihx5JvcEoBg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:00:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Listen to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.

The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an "efficient market."Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about "Pepsi pricing power," and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine:You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases:But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to "significantly higher selling prices" and "our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures":But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In , Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc):These companies have been hiking prices for years, but  started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else.Big Potato controls  of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs from these companies meet up at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and by job-hopping between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal pricing."This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they . A director at McCain said that "higher ups" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone "behaving themselves," chortling that they'd "never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry." Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to "pricing actions."Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like "Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory":This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same "recommendations" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep:Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: "four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market."The "price fixing is legal if we do it with an app" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents:And private equity companies have rolled up all the  companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment:This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are "efficient" – find in their favor if they do?Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion,  source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.Picks and Shovels: a sequel to "Red Team Blues," about the heroic era of the PC, Tor Books, February 2025Unauthorized Bread: a middle-grades graphic novel adapted from my novella about refugees, toasters and DRM, FirstSecond, 2025Enshittification: a nonfiction book about platform decay for Farrar, Straus, Giroux.

ABSTRACT
In this talk & demo, we have a look at some of the low-hanging problems in general aviation and how functional programming can be applied to provide significant improvements in efficiency and air safety. The current solutions to problems such as navigation, traffic/terrain collision avoidance and weight/balance calculations will be demonstrated to the audience, mostly for amusement. More seriously, we will have a look at the legacy that has led to the way things are, and how to improve by applying our programming skills.

We will look at:
• how aviation safety is regulated.
• how aeronautical services are provided to flight operators.
• how aeronautical navigation is conducted and regulated.
• how the weight and balance for a flight is conducted.
• the methods by which aircraft and ground coordinate between each other.

We will see:
• some real (and basic) data management problems in aviation, that very obviously threaten safety, then solve them, using programming.
• we will see a live demonstration of aeronautical navigation methods, investigate incident reports where lives were lost as a result, and consider how our programming skills can yield improvements, possibly even save lives.
• we will conduct a real weight&balance calculation for a flight, then once hilarity inevitably ensues, we will look at the problems that arise by this method, then solve them using data structures and functional programming. Some of these practical problems are obvious, even to a non-aviator, and the predictable incident reports are the end result.
• finally, we will have a look at a live demonstration of a software defined radio (SDR), receiving ADS-B transmissions from aircraft (live), an #AHRS implementation and #GNSS receiver using off-the-shelf, low-cost parts. We will look at why these instruments are helpful to aircraft pilots and interact with that device using the #Haskell programming language.

"[P]otential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft."

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure... "The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok," said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. "ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership...." Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux... 


Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as "qualified divestiture" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S... A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. "A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control," the Congressional staffer said. "There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access...." 


Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions "should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles." The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.
 

"Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin&apos;s Military Hallucinations with Karina Tseng and Anthony Ratinov</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diDnVUPRaYI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/diDnVUPRaYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch Karina & Anthony's full Polonaise performances:

What’s Going on in the Containerd Neighborhood? - Phil Estes, AWS; Samuel Karp, Google; Akihiro Suda, NTT; Michael Brown, IBM; Kirtana Ashok, Microsoft

Our recent maintainer sessions have covered the soon-to-launch containerd v2.0. During this session led by maintainers we will give a brief update on 2.0, but will spend more time looking at the ecosystem around us. Why does containerd exist? What value does it bring to the overall cloud native world? How are other projects using it to build and extend containerd in useful ways? We’ll spend some time on containerd’s largest subproject, nerdctl, which also has an upcoming 2.0 release, and additionally catch the community up on activity in our Rust subproject ecosystem, the runwasi containerd shim, and lazy loading snapshotters. Since this is KubeCon, we’ll also provide an update on CRI changes and KEP-driven additions around NRI, DRA, and checkpoint/restore. Attendees will leave with a broad view of the larger containerd ecosystem of projects as well as key information on how to get involved if you are interested to help and contribute in any way to the “containerd neighborhood!”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome &amp; Introduction: A Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the CNCF Landscape- Katherine Druckman, Lori Lorusso</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCAOa0-VdU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hTCAOa0-VdU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 23:37:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

It's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux "is the most widely used OS for data center servers," according to the article:

The team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. "All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it," said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. "If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the Internet could be positively affected by this." 

The University of Waterloo is building a green computer server room as part of its new mathematics building, and Karsten believes sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists. "We all have a part to play in building a greener future," he said. The Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the Linux OS, is a founder member of the Green Software Foundation, an organization set up to look at ways of developing "green software" — code that reduces energy consumption. 

Karsten "teamed up with Joe Damato, distinguished engineer at Fastly" to develop the 30 lines of code, according to an announcement from the university. "The Linux kernel code addition developed by Karsten and Damato was based on research published in ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review" (by Karsten and grad student Peter Cai). 

Their paper "reviews the performance characteristics of network stack processing for communication-heavy server applications," devising an "indirect methodology" to "identify and quantify the direct and indirect costs of asynchronous hardware interrupt requests (IRQ) as a major source of overhead... 

"Based on these findings, a small modification of a vanilla Linux system is devised that improves the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking significantly, resulting in up to 45% increased throughput..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steam Brick: No screen, no controller, just a power button and a USB port</title><link>https://crastinator-pro.github.io/steam-brick/</link><author>sbarre</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 22:15:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expec...

Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expectations - Sohan Kunkerkar, Red Hat Inc

As Kubernetes and container technologies evolve, shifting from cgroup v1 to cgroup v2 has become a pivotal development. With cgroup v2 available in Kubernetes since v1.25, we're at a crossroads where many users and organizations must decide when and how to transition fully to this new system. Despite the benefits of cgroup v2, including better resource management and enhanced capabilities, users frequently encounter unexpected challenges signaling a gap in readiness and understanding. This talk will address the practical implications of moving to cgroup v2, discuss the coordinated efforts to deprecate cgroup v1, and propose actionable strategies to bridge the gap between the Kubernetes community, system administrators, and developers. By focusing on real-world experiences and providing clear guidance, this session aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this significant change confidently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lightning Talk: Minimizing Data Loss Within the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector - Alex Kats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxRkfVXdy9E</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xxRkfVXdy9E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:38:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lightning Talk: Minimizing Data Loss Within the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector - Alex Kats, Capital One

The OTel collector is meant to serve as a reliable and highly performant data pipeline. However, as a single component in a wider observability architecture, it is only as reliable as the downstream platforms/services it exports data to. The OTel collector has several built in mechanisms that aim to minimize the impact of unhealthy downstream exporters, including an out of the box sending queue with an additional configuration parameter for persistent queueing. There is a new component in the OTel contrib distribution, the Failover Connector. The Failover Connector allows for dynamic routing or “failover” of telemetry data based on downstream exporter health. This provides significant improvement to the data resiliency of the collector, as telemetry data can be continuously exported to a set of stable secondary locations, while the issues with the primary are resolved.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KubeSlice: Migrate Kubernetes Services With Confidence! | Project Lightning Talk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkl7EnILe-o</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Xkl7EnILe-o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:21:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

KubeSlice: Migrate Kubernetes Services With Confidence! | Project Lightning Talk

SREs have been constantly asked to look for solutions to help them migrate K8S services from one Cloud cluster to another Cloud cluster while continuing to provide secure access to managed Cloud services left behind in the original Cloud.

The K8S services securely access these managed services using private endpoint FQDN. When SREs are asked to move the K8S services to a different Cloud cluster they hit a roadblock - there is no easy solution to provide private endpoint FQDN access to a managed service from a remote Cloud cluster.

CNCF sandbox project KubeSlice solves this use case in an elegant way.

KubeSlice enables SREs to create a Slice across clusters and slice overlay network connects services in the clusters. An external services gateway on the Slice in the original Cloud cluster will provide access to managed services via alias service FQDN import. Services in other clusters can reach the cloud service via the same private endpoint FQDN resolved by the Slice DNS.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Now You See Me: Tame MTTR with Real-Time Anomaly Dete...

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.

Is consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it’s so hard to pin down what makes you “you.” From Descartes’ “beast machines” to Darwin’s revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. 

Will AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness—or even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids—tiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us—and why it matters.

The continent’s total gas reserves are almost as large as those of the US. But will local people actually benefit from the export of gas, as hoped?

Europe is looking for new gas producers. This is because Russia’s war against Ukraine has highlighted Europe's and especially Germany's dependence on Russian gas. One possible solution is to increase gas imports from Africa, which already account for around a fifth of the gas used in Europe.

Mozambique in southern Africa is expected to become the third largest African exporter of liquefied natural gas. Senegal in West Africa is also seen as a major future gas supplier. 

What does this development mean for the people of Mozambique and Senegal? Will they actually benefit from gas exports as hoped? Can the utilization of gas reserves create new jobs and help to reduce migration from Senegal to Europe? 

So far, the gas sector in Mozambique has led to conflict rather than prosperity. Is a turnaround in sight? Or is African gas coming too late to be relevant for European climate neutrality targets?

Will God transform the cosmos? God has promised to give God’s own salvation or eternal life to human beings. In the context of the resurrection of the dead, could God also reconstitute or restructure the entire physical universe? What could this mean? Our universe is immense. Suppose there are multiple universes? How far might God go?

ABSTRACT
What are the characteristics of a good software engineer? It's a topic many people would argue endlessly about. This is not surprising given we are effectively living in the era of software alchemy. Some of the best programmers draw on strong scientific and engineering background and combine this with craft like coding skills in a virtuous feedback cycle.

In this talk we explore the individual practices and techniques that can help bring out the engineer in you.

Nothing but NATS - Going Beyond Cloud Native - Byron Ruth & Kevin Hoffman, Synadia

These days building so-called cloud-native apps involves assembling a custom stack of tools 10x bigger than the app we're building. Additionally, applications increasingly need to expand out to the edge and cloud-native stacks simply don't work in those environments. Fortunately with NATS, we don't need a stack. In this session you'll see how we can leverage compute, storage, and connectivity to build cloud-to-edge native apps more powerful than ever, with less code, effort, and frustration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Simple Diagram That Will Change How You See Space and Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT1QSi8y56k</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BT1QSi8y56k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Third Episode in our series on the Theory of Everything, we're exploring the simultaneity of your past, present and future.

Poet and essayist Rita Dove was awarded the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for her third poetry book, "Thomas and Beulah". She received the 1996 National Humanities Medal from President Clinton and the 2011 National Medal of Arts from President Obama – the only poet honored with both White House recognitions.

She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family’s fate played no role in her life.

But when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. 

Eva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. 

Her mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva’s young life.

During her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.

But a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. 

Later in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible. The Judeo-Christian scriptures tell of a future time when all things shall be made new. What could this mean? Does ‘all’ include the entire cosmos? Multiple universes, if there are such? Could such an ancient vision ever make sense? Believers say, “It’s God’s mystery.” They should say more.

DESCRIPTION
Tod Golding, author of "Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) ", discusses the critical need for collaboration between business and technical roles in organizations adopting a SaaS model with Bill Tarr. He advocates for a top-down vision that encourages non-technical roles, such as finance and operations, to engage deeply with technical teams, fostering a service mindset rather than a sole focus on product features.

Tod highlights the importance of operational insights in multi-tenant environments, where effective monitoring of tenant behaviors is essential to prevent issues before they impact customers. He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.

Looking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.

"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores in different places, but to build a single, cross-platform store in which, within the era of multi-platform games, if you buy a game or digital items in one place, you have the ability to own them everywhere," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters during a press briefing. The Verge reports: Under the program, Epic will offer new free games in the store each month before eventually switching to a weekly schedule. However, the games aren't actually in the store yet -- Epic said on Thursday that it "ran into a few bugs that we're working through now" and "we'll provide an update once the games are live and ready to play!"
 
To sweeten the deal for developers that participate in the free games program on iOS, Epic will help defray the cost of using third-party marketplaces. For one year, it will pay these developers' Core Technology Fee (CTF): a 50 euro cent fee levied on every install of an iOS app that uses third-party stores after it exceeds 1 million annual downloads. (Apple gives developers with less than 10 million euros in global revenue a three-year on-ramp.) [...] Epic writes in its blog post that covering the fee "is not financially viable for every third party app store or for Epic long term, but we'll do it while the European Commission investigates Apple's non-compliance with the law."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Panama Canal</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-panama-canal</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/679116867e5a4982476a84b0/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=awug-Mo6-Ic-lR51OOIDX5aFz_rgMofpwEwQhaVnSlM" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the history of the Panama Canal and why does Trump think he can 'take it back'? Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Adds Support For The Microsoft Copilot Key Found On New Laptops</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2333254/linux-614-adds-support-for-the-microsoft-copilot-key-found-on-new-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.14 kernel now maps out support for Microsoft's "Copilot" key "so that user-space software can determine the behavior for handling that key's action on the Linux desktop," writes Phoronix's Michael Larabel.

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumen Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why So Many Ancient Civilizations Collapsed At The Same Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8YQuyjWks</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1l8YQuyjWks?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bronze Age collapse is perhaps one of the greatest disasters in human history and also one of the least understood.

The universe is expanding and that expansion is accelerating under the power of dark energy and eventually all matter and energy will be dispersed over such unthinkable distances that nothing can stop space from blowing up infinitely. Unless of course cosmologists blundered and dark energy doesn't even exist. Then it's back to the drawing board.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

According to reports, minors are being sexually exploited in many bars in the red -light district. 

A DW documentary on sex tourism in Pattaya unleashed a wave of outrage after it was broadcast at the end of 2023. Thailand's national media picked up the story, focused on the case of a suspected German pedophile who managed to leave the country. Even the prime minister made a statement, following the documentary’s release.  

But what’s happened since then? How has the situation in Thailand changed?

The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.On January 7, PowerSchool revealed that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal.

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).→ A collection (or list) of books → A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. → Fetch all books → Create a new book → Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Love letter from 1940&apos;s that Amy Tan&apos;s dad sent to her mom 🥰 #FindingYourRoots #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ifdDk5LMJs</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-ifdDk5LMJs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Henry Louis Gates, Jr. shares with Amy Tan the love letters from her father to her mother written in the 1940's which researchers found in Shanghai court archives.

Stories about drug use by Hitler and German forces during World War II have been widely told. What’s less well known is the Allied commanders’ embraced pharmacological “force enhancers” as well.  By 1941, rumors about Nazi soldiers using a “super-drug” identified as the methamphetamine Pervitin were confirmed, and Allied commanders launched their own classified program to find the perfect war-fighting drug.

– Nikola TeslaIt’s got a 4K AMOLED display, a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard, plays Minecraft at 4K, runs +7B LLMs, surfs the web, and has ~7h battery life. All open-source.How I Made A Laptop From Scratch (YouTube.com). Demo at 22:14.The writeup below pretty much abridges the video above.Imagine a skill-chart of qualities of technology: screen, audio, performance, build, tactility, touch-interaction, efficiency, size, and so many more. At the balancing point of all these qualities is the laptop. To that end, let’s build a laptop that hits as many qualities of a modern commercial thin & light laptop—while trying to do as much from scratch as possible.Booting and inserting magnetically attached keyboardEpic Hypixel Bedwars gamingFinding an electron in a cloudI first made a mental map and transferred it into Obsidian:Boiling it down, it landed me with a lofty list of goals:RK3588 SoC Motherboard
Powertrain
~60Wh Li-ion battery packPeripherals
Wireless mechanical keyboardGlass-topped multi-touch trackpadAnodized aluminum CNC chassisI looked towards single-board computer SoCs, as board manufacturers commonly release schematics for reference. In many aspects, the Rockchip RK3588 is the fastest consumer-procurable chip on the market. Despite the spotty software support, the hardware documentation has lots of developer resources and reference schematics from SBC manufacturers.Quad core A76 and quad core A55I/O: 8K display, dual USB3.1, PCIe 3.0 x 4, HDMI2.1/eDP 1.4, etc.With only a few months to work on this project, an SoM (system on module) like the Raspberry Pi CM5 presented the best option for its hardware compatibility and a high likelihood of a snug integration. Choosing an SoM also alleviates memory and other high-speed signaling concerns. Looking around for a RK3588 SoM, I came across the CM3588 by FriendlyElec. Cheap, well-documented, and easily procurable. Sounds good!I hopped on panelook.com and filtered by size and resolution. I’ve always been a sucker for high pixel density, so I went with a 4K AMOLED 13.3” display. Cross referencing stock availability on Taobao (Chinese domestic Aliexpress), the ATNA33TP11 seemed to be the one with most  stock since OLED risked burn-in.A highlight: during display evaluation, switching out a connector and shortening the board by 2mm improved signal integrity  for the 1.5GHz x 4 signals go pass through. Getting the display running on Linux meant finding system logs from Asus laptops that have this display, reverse-engineering the values, and tuning the power-on timings amongst other things . TLDR; getting a 4K AMOLED eDP display running on non-mainline Linux was a heck of a journey, so read this if you’re interested (coming soon).ATNA33TP11 working with display evaluation board V2 shortThe cells had to be 6mm thin and four packs lined up should take roughly half of the entire chassis volume. Chinese manufacturers don’t stock batteries readily, and shipping them to the US would be a pain. Thus, I looked on the American side. I stumbled upon with these batteries from AA Portable Power Corp. or batteryspace.com. or Powerizer. Doing the power calculations, we get: 4.250Ah  4S = 62.9 Wh with max 8A (so max 134.4W discharge)! Solid.The total voltage is 4.2V (peak) * 4S = 16.8V. The system’s designed for up to 20V USB-C (AKA 100W) and passed into the BQ25713 charging IC. The batteries are balanced with the BQ77915 to ensure safe charging, and the power is tracked with an LTC2943 to calculate a state-of-charge percentage. I popped in an ESP32-S3 module as the controller for everything, and set it to production.After writing drivers and sitting on the undecipherable datasheets for days, I had the batteries charging. I successfully load tested it to around 5A and powered the full system. There’s still a lot of quiescent current (about ~50mA), but I haven’t had the time to optimize the firmware.The USB of the ESP32 connects to the internal USB on the motherboard to feed the power telemetry over UART. A Python script and kernel module in the OS forwards it to the battery service in the kernel to display it natively.Powertrain V0.2 inside laptopIn settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scrollWith those decisions made up, I aimed for >90mm motherboard width based on a prelim CAD from the batteries and display dimensions.On the physical I/O side, I settled on dual USB3.1 Type-C ports, a USB2.0 Type-A port, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Internally, the M.2 E-key connects to an RTL8852BE WiFi 6 (802.11ax) + BT5.2 wireless card and the M.2 M-key accommodates up to an 2242-sized NVMe SSD. A full size NVMe SSD can fit with some modifications of the chassis too.Tangent over, this leaves me with around ~90mm of board height. Implementing all the features on the final mainboard would stretch this writeup too long, so read this if you’re interested (coming soon).In settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scrollDetailed hardware overviewJoshua Riek’s ubuntu-rockchip kernel/distro combined an out-of-the-box experience with lots of optimizations. Using Armbian’s kernel (I believe it’s still off Rockchip’s kernel) meant that it offered nearly all the features of the RK3588 on a developer-ready kernel configuration.Since nearly all the work I needed to do was abstracted in the DeviceTree (DTS) hardware configuration language implemented with U-boot, the bootloader, I took advantage of their system-agnostic nature to speed up my trial-and-error process having never done any Linux work.Instead of developing and compiling code on the RK3588 itself, I used my daily driver MacBook and Visual Studio Code. Once I made a change in the DTS, I’d use Orbstack (virtualization software) running Ubuntu 24.04 (shared filesystem and kernel with macOS) and compile the DeviceTree there.Pointing U-Boot to a custom compiled DTB (devicetree binary), I ’ed the compiled  to the OS. A  regenerates the bootloader configurations, and a reboot updates the changes.That’s how I did the hardware bringup—display configurations, PCIe, USB, and other low-level system tweaks. The rest is just a standard install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Linux Kernel 6.1.Testing batteries and writing DTSIn-depth software overviewImagine being able to just pull out your laptop’s keyboard and use it as just another wireless keyboard for literally anything! Just me? Maybe.Being a mechanical keyboard addict with quite a few ZMK keyboards designed, I chose the Cherry MX ULP mechanical switches for the best feel. Of course, a battery and fully mechanical switches add  of height. I used a 1mm thin 200mAh battery and a custom battery protection board that sticks up between two rows of keys to cut down on ~1.6mm (PCB height). The nRF52840 SoC running ZMK Firmware is right underneath the spacebar. A sandwich of PLA and 6061 aluminum from Fabworks crammed everything under ~7mm.Since the keycaps aren’t easily procurable, I got a 0.15mm nozzle for my Bambu Lab X1C and printed them with PLA. It got me down a rabbit hole of tungsten nozzles, and I got quoted ~$400 for 20x 0.15mm nozzles. I’ve been thinking of trying that out too. But alas, printing out all the keycaps and assembling for the last time, the keyboard was done.Moving on to the trackpad, it was quite quick. I knew from the start that I wanted a good trackpad, so making my own with zero capacitive tracking experience is a no-go. Searching online, I came across the Azoteq PXM0057-401 evaluation module on Mouser. It had it all—glass surface, multi-touch, and worked over USB. And, it was only 35 bucks or so. However, the trackpad has ceased production without many alternatives.With the keyboard and trackpad working, it was time to put on the finishing touches.In settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scroll*Counterclockwise from top left: keyboard side profile, typing on keyboard, trackpad, 1mm battery on back, nRF52840 SoC areaOnShape wireframe exploded viewRoughly the same time I began the system design, I sent a few CNC aluminum blocks off to JLC for evaluation with different anodization finishes. The dark gray anodization felt “best”, but I preferred the look of the matte black, so I settled on that.
Using PTC OnShape, I (attempted) CAD’ed a robust and minimalistic look and a blend of my two favorite laptop lineup designs, the Razer Blade and the MacBook Pro. Because of the removable keyboard, the bottom has no screws. Instead, the palm rest screws into the bottom chassis. CAD Link here.The hardest part about the chassis was the hinge. I used Framework’s 13.3” hinge because it has a 3D model. I constrained it in OnShape so I can see the exact closing angles.The chassis layout is fairly simple: batteries on the bottom, the power board on the right, motherboard on the left, and the hinge mechanism on top. Oh, and a transparent PETG FDM printed power button that lights up on a custom PCB. To balance out the asymmetric hinge (caused by the mainboard being too wide), a little carbon fiber rod lines up on the left side too.It was a battle to get the screen assembly to not hit anything while also covering
Although I started considering thermals way in advance, hence the gap here for the heatpipe to go through, I still had difficulty fitting everything in. The distance between the bottom of the keyboard and the top of the heatsink is less than a half a millimeter. The cooling system is really constrained because I don’t have the resources to make a custom heatpipe and fin solution. So, I made a full copper CNC heatsink (from JLCCNC) and a heatpipe connected to a fan. It’s all connected with PTM7950.I also added these PUI audio speakers on either side. The audio from the CM3588’s DAC didn’t work and I ran out of debugging time, so I made a USB to audio converter board separately and shot it through an Class-D amplifier. I would’ve also made the amp, but I ran out of time.As I reached final assembly, I used a mix of JLC’s selective laser sintering (SLS) of nylon powder and FDM printed PA6-CF for smaller structural parts. Putting it all together with the matte black CNC aluminum chassis, I finally had my laptop.Inside full laptop assemblyThe hardest class I’ve taken so far was quantum mechanics in my junior spring term. A few months before spending hours solving time-independent and dependent Schrödinger equations, I was on the squash bus (the sport, not the vegetable). My friend suggested I make a laptop for my senior project—and that was all.
I came up with the name anyon_e in June, after I finished the quantum course.Making this laptop was hard. Mentally pressured with a deadline, and a constant inter-disciplinary challenge across electrical, software, and mechanical systems. Summing up everything I’ve ever done. It took up most of my mind from May until now.Inspired by open-source projects like ZMK, KiCAD, Blender, and countless OSHW projects, I want to do my own little part. To put power in people’s hands in creation, innovation, imagination, or whatever else. To attempt the impossible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kyle&apos;s Frat Party (Dear Kelly Scene)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c1OWon1MSo</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0c1OWon1MSo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:07:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To see our new movie 'Dear Kelly,' head over to https://www.dearkellyfilm.com/, where it is available for purchase OR $5.55/rental.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dark web PHP dev Ross Ulbricht released from prison…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-wuoIDdjw</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gi-wuoIDdjw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:04:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ross Ulbricht received a presidential pardon for his crimes related to the Silk Road.

The list of signs of torture is long and can be seen on some 27,000 photos showing dead Syrian civilians. The man who smuggled the photos out of the country calls himself "Caesar”.

During the long decades of the Assad regime, hundreds of thousands of people disappeared inside its torture centers.  For years, "Caesar” worked as a photographer for the Syrian military, taking pictures of civilians tortured to death and documenting their cases. Who are the dead, what was their fate, and why did they disappear? Throughout Europe, the families of the victims, supported by international lawyers, activists and Caesar himself, are searching for truth and justice. They are investigating the Syrian death machine and the actions of its officials. Before the collapse of the regime in December 2024, this was both difficult and dangerous, there was always the risk that investigations based abroad could endanger further the lives of those behind Assad’s bars.

The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals.A DNS lookup on the domain az.mastercard.com on Jan. 14, 2025 shows the mistyped domain name a22-65.akam.ne.From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider [DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in “akam.net” but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain “.”This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by , founder of the security consultancy Seralys. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of Niger.Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn’t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include “akam.ne,” but they were by far the largest.But the researcher said he didn’t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.“We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,” a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. “This typo has now been corrected.”Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through , a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via a post on LinkedIn (after he’d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.MasterCard’s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. “Titon” on infosec.exchange.Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.“I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,” Caturegli wrote in reply. “Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.” Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard’s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like  and .“So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,” Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or “Time To Live” — a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network — an attacker’s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.“With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,” he said.The researcher said he’d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.“We obviously disagree with this assessment,” Caturegli wrote in a follow-up post on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard’s public statement. “But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.”Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain.As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain . It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft’s  cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.“Don’t be like Mastercard,” Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. “Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.”One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously — in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an “Ivan I.” from Moscow. Passive DNS records from DomainTools.com show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.This is interesting given a comment on Caturegli’s LinkedIn post from an ex-Cloudflare employee who linked to a report he co-authored on a similar typo domain apparently registered in 2017 for organizations that may have mistyped their AWS DNS server as “” instead of “.” DomainTools reports that this typo domain also was registered to a Yandex user (playlotto@yandex.ru), and was hosted at the same German ISP — Team Internet (AS61969).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Internet is (once again) awash with IoT botnets delivering record DDoSes</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/the-internet-is-once-again-awash-with-iot-botnets-delivering-record-ddoses/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddos-for-hire.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:10:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re only three weeks into 2025, and it’s already shaping up to be the year of Internet of Things-driven DDoSes.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There’s a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there’s no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn’t run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user’s data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don’t lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don’t like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here’s how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It’s easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it’s possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it’s necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn’t store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it’s stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user’s followers.Yet it’s expensive to push updates to each follower’s repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn’t index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user’s actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn’t contain this information. So the stream’s data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower’s repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here’s the workflow for displaying a post:A user’s request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server’s disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user’s unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‘bsky.social’ subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don’t affect their previous posts.A user’s DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user’s handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here’s how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user’s timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user’s repository doesn’t contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user’s timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed’s content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post’s timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result’s offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter’s window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it’s possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here’s how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay’s Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let’s dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won’t scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don’t use different CPU cores at once. So here’s how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user’s DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let’s take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it’s inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won’t scale for Bluesky’s needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it’s stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won’t scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap’s serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it’s a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it’s included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here’s how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user’s data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn’t store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user’s repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here’s how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server’s request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

He will be succeeded by Nikki Santoro, who has served as the chief operating officer since 2021. TechCrunch reports: Santoro's appointment is significant, as she is the first woman to become the CEO and only the second person to hold the position. Needham founded IMDb in 1990 at the age of 23, steering the company into a powerhouse within the entertainment industry. After 35 years, he'll transition to a new role as executive chair.
 
According to Needham, Santoro's ascension is well deserved. [...] Santoro has been with the company since 2016, leading the company in expanding its database and improving its IMDbPro membership. She previously held leadership positions at Amazon, Microsoft, and The Weather Channel. "Nikki's strategic vision, deep understanding of our customers and products, and commitment to innovation have already delivered impressive business results during her tenure as COO," said Needham in a statement. "Her track record of driving growth and enhancing our products and services makes her the ideal person to guide IMDb into a new era."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How WW1 Inspired The Lord of The Rings</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/tolkien-in-the-trenches-how-ww1-shaped-lord-of-the-rings</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6746005578f05cc6cc55e5d4/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BhhPK2bfU_hyRBJ8-JYzfJGAC_5vwJ7LDRNuGzt_o38" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:30:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After Hitler: The Cleanup That Followed WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTRLhs9tI70</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gTRLhs9tI70?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary tells the story of the clean-up that followed WW2.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JS7UMDHz3Qc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice sit down with science writer Dava Sobel, author of a new book on Skłodowska-Curie, to explore the enduring impact of her work on radioactivity.

Discover how Skłodowska-Curie’s meticulous research led to the isolation of radium and polonium—elements that unlocked the mysteries of radioactivity and laid the foundation for modern physics and chemistry. Learn how her insights paved the way for radioactive dating, which determined the Earth’s age, and her revolutionary contributions to medical science, including the use of radium to treat cancer and the development of mobile X-ray units during World War I.

We dive into the science behind her two Nobel Prizes—one in physics and one in chemistry—and her perseverance in refining tiny quantities of radioactive material from tons of ore. We also discuss the risks she and her collaborators faced as the dangers of radiation exposure became clear, as well as the scientific advances inspired by her work, including the creation of artificial radioelements for medical applications.

From her early experiments to her lab notes—still radioactive today—Skłodowska-Curie’s story is one of unrelenting curiosity and dedication. Join us for a deep dive into the science that defined her career and the discoveries that continue to shape our understanding of the universe.

Elaine is from Brazil, Yassin is from Tunisia. Camera teams accompany the two for nine months in their new working environments.

Germany’s labor market desperately needs skilled workers - particularly in the medical sector. There’s also a high demand for professional drivers. That’s why many companies are recruiting internationally.

Elaine from Brazil worked as head of nursing at the emergency department and intensive care unit of a clinic in São Paulo. She’s married and has an eight-year-old son. She’s long dreamed of living in Europe; São Paulo’s high crime rate is one of the reasons why she’s keen to leave her homeland. "I can’t travel alone to early or late shifts. I’ll either be raped or robbed," she says. In Germany, she’s hoping for security and a better quality of life - something she’d like for her son in particular. Elaine initially goes to Düsseldorf alone; the family plans to join her later. But it won’t be easy for the Brazilian woman. Despite the language barrier, bureaucracy, and the loneliness that comes with being separated from her loved ones, can Elaine start to feel at home in Germany?
Yassin originates from Sousse, a Tunisian coastal city. After leaving fininshing his schooling, he worked there as a truck driver. In Tunisia, the only requirements for this job are a driving license and initial training. Things are different in Germany: Yassin is training as a professional driver for three-and-a-half years at a haulage company in Hesse. Tunisian driver’s licenses aren’t recognized in European countries, so he needs to pass the tests again. Yassin’s trainers describe him as ‘highly motivated and very good’. His final exam is coming up soon. Will the young man, who’s also learning German, make it as a skilled worker on the German labor market? If so, he’d like a small flat where he can invite friends round. His current room, which doesn’t have a kitchen, isn’t suitable - and hospitality is very important in his home country.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people’s diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed—Open APIs and Internal APIs—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python’s built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list  fruits = ["apple", "banana"] fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element  fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[   { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },   { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" } ]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">    <soapenv:Header/>    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalance>          <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>       </bank:GetAccountBalance>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>          <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>       </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{   user(id: 123) {     name     email     posts {       title       likes     }   } }{   "data": {     "user": {       "name": "Alice",       "email": "alice@example.com",       "posts": [         { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },         { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }       ]     }   } }gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here’s a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests  url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C") else:     print("Error:", response.status_code) – Sends an API request. – Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 – Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don’t always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}") elif response.status_code == 401:     print("Error: Invalid API key") elif response.status_code == 404:     print("Error: City not found") else:     print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject’s work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).: We’re currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/128/changelog-news-128.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the “personal” back in “personal computer”, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67892eb0c2824244c27b929f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=3pCPGiAXWzux-J-3YCe1OwbmIbvcy6B9C-AaxFO1HJk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the LA Wildfires Started ️‍🔥</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v328qNRMYcc</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/v328qNRMYcc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 23:56:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

But now it can do it even better, explains Marco Ippolito of the Node.js steering committee:

In August 2024 Node.js introduced a new experimental feature, Type Stripping, aimed at addressing a longstanding challenge in the Node.js ecosystem: running TypeScript with no configuration. Enabled by default in Node.js v23.6.0, this feature is on its way to becoming stable. 


TypeScript has reached incredible levels of popularity and has been the most requested feature in all the latest Node.js surveys. Unlike other alternatives such as CoffeeScript or Flow, which never gained similar traction, TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern development. While it has been supported in Node.js for some time through loaders, they relied heavily on configuration and user libraries. This reliance led to inconsistencies between different loaders, making them difficult to use interchangeably. The developer experience suffered due to these inconsistencies and the extra setup required... The goal is to make development faster and simpler, eliminating the overhead of configuration while maintaining the flexibility that developers expect... 

TypeScript is not just a language, it also relies on a toolchain to implement its features. The primary tool for this purpose is tsc, the TypeScript compiler CLI... Type checking is tightly coupled to the implementation of tsc, as there is no formal specification for how the language's type system should behave. This lack of a specification means that the behavior of tsc is effectively the definition of TypeScript's type system. tsc does not follow semantic versioning, so even minor updates can introduce changes to type checking that may break existing code. Transpilation, on the other hand, is a more stable process. It involves converting TypeScript code into JavaScript by removing types, transforming certain syntax constructs, and optionally "downleveling" the JavaScript to allow modern syntax to execute on older JavaScript engines. Unlike type checking, transpilation is less likely to change in breaking ways across versions of tsc. The likelihood of breaking changes is further reduced when we only consider the minimum transpilation needed to make the TypeScript code executable — and exclude downleveling of new JavaScript features not yet available in the JavaScript engine but available in TypeScript... 

Node.js, before enabling it by default, introduced --experimental-strip-types. This mode allows running TypeScript files by simply stripping inline types without performing type checking or any other code transformation. This minimal technique is known as Type Stripping. By excluding type checking and traditional transpilation, the more unstable aspects of TypeScript, Node.js reduces the risk of instability and mostly sidesteps the need to track minor TypeScript updates. Moreover, this solution does not require any configuration in order to execute code... Node.js eliminates the need for source maps by replacing the removed syntax with blank spaces, ensuring that the original locations of the code and structure remain intact. It is transparent — the code that runs is the code the author wrote, minus the types... 

"As this experimental feature evolves, the Node.js team will continue collaborating with the TypeScript team and the community to refine its behavior and reduce friction. You can check the roadmap for practical next steps..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Horrifying Things We Used To Use As Medicine</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qwdBt9ZBr8</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6qwdBt9ZBr8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s hard to imagine a world where illnesses were treated with things like rushing currents or leeches, but not so long ago, that was the case.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

The findings appear in a pre-print paper titled "How is Google using AI for internal code migrations?" The Register reports: Their focus is on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas, such as Ads, Search, Workspace and YouTube, instead of generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services like code completion, code review, and question answering. Google's code migrations involved: changing 32-bit IDs in the 500-plus-million-line codebase for Google Ads to 64-bit IDs; converting its old JUnit3 testing library to JUnit4; and replacing the Joda time library with Java's standard java.time package. The int32 to int64 migration, the Googlers explain, was not trivial as the IDs were often generically defined (int32_t in C++ or Integer in Java) and were not easily searchable. They existed in tens of thousands of code locations across thousands of files. Changes had to be tracked across multiple teams and changes to class interfaces had to be considered across multiple files. "The full effort, if done manually, was expected to require hundreds of software engineering years and complex crossteam coordination," the authors explain.
 
For their LLM-based workflow, Google's software engineers implemented the following process. An engineer from Ads would identify an ID in need of migration using a combination of code search, Kythe, and custom scripts. Then an LLM-based migration toolkit, triggered by someone knowledgeable in the art, was run to generate verified changes containing code that passed unit tests. Those changes would be manually checked by the same engineer and potentially corrected. Thereafter, the code changes would be sent to multiple reviewers who are responsible for the portion of the codebase affected by the changes. The result was that 80 percent of the code modifications in the change lists (CLs) were purely the product of AI; the remainder were either human-authored or human-edited AI suggestions.
 
"We discovered that in most cases, the human needed to revert at least some changes the model made that were either incorrect or not necessary," the authors observe. "Given the complexity and sensitive nature of the modified code, effort has to be spent in carefully rolling out each change to users." Based on this, Google undertook further work on LLM-driven verification to reduce the need for detailed review. Even with the need to double-check the LLM's work, the authors estimate that the time required to complete the migration was reduced by 50 percent. With LLM assistance, it took just three months to migrate 5,359 files and modify 149,000 lines of code to complete the JUnit3-JUnit4 transition. Approximately 87 percent of the code generated by AI ended up being committed with no changes. As for the Joda-Java time framework switch, the authors estimate a time saving of 89 percent compared to the projected manual change time, though no specifics were provided to support that assertion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Other people&apos;s robots (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/76</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/76/changelog--friends-76.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod & Adam discuss Nvidia’s recently announced personal AI supercomputer, Waymo’s latest infinite loop, what’s involved in getting a “modern” terminal setup, and whether or not AI has gone mainstream… warts & all!Changelog++ members get a bonus 8 minutes at the end of this episode and zero ads.

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

Now, as Donald Trump prepares for a second term, this nexus of "MAGA" and money could make Florida the policy blueprint for the rest of the nation.

Dark matter has eluded us for many decades. Even our most advanced particle colliders and sophisticated underground detectors have come up short. But it may be that we can finally solve this mystery with a much simpler experiment, involving a ray of light, a good clock, and the planet Mars.

First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.This raises the price of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription from $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "Classic" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "services & subscriptions" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Slashes Google&apos;s Code Migration Time By Half</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/16/1810253/ai-slashes-googles-code-migration-time-by-half?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:51:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has cut code migration time in half by deploying AI tools to assist with large-scale software updates, according to a new research paper from the company's engineers.

These baths were more than places for hygiene — they were essential to Roman social life. Citizens would visit the baths after their morning business, using the time not only to clean but to socialize, network, and even conduct business. The grandeur of the baths is exemplified by their mosaics, shrines, and gyms, which catered to all aspects of Roman daily life.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

"We don't care about professional coders anymore," CEO Amjad Masad told Semafor, as the company refocuses on helping non-developers build software using AI. 

The strategic shift follows the September launch of Replit's "Agent" tool, which can create working applications from simple text commands. The tool, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, has driven a five-fold revenue increase in six months. The move marks a significant departure for Replit, which built its business providing online coding tools for software developers. The company is now betting that AI will make traditional programming skills less crucial, allowing non-technical users to create software through natural language instructions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft patches Windows to eliminate Secure Boot bypass threat</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-patches-windows-to-eliminate-secure-boot-bypass-threat/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/exploit-vulnerability-security-1.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:24:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past seven months—and likely longer—an industry-wide standard that protects Windows devices from firmware infections could be bypassed using a simple technique. On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Forensics with Emre Tinaztepe</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/16/digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2585624665.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data for investigative purposes.

It wasn’t a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don’t need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I’ll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier—and hopefully, they’ll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here’s what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.This post is for paid subscribers.

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

It minimizes data copied by transferring only the changed parts of files, making it faster and more bandwidth-efficient than traditional copying methods provided by tools like sftp or ftp-ssl. Rsync versions 3.3.0 and below has been found with SIX serious vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these to leak your data, corrupt your files, or even take over your system. There is a heap-based buffer overflow with a CVSS score of 9.8 that needs to be addressed on both the client and server sides of rsync package. Apart from that info leak via uninitialized stack contents defeats ASLR protection and rsync server can make client write files outside of destination directory using symbolic links.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are we in the Matrix?😎 Neil deGrasse Tyson &amp; Laurence Fishburne reveal the Science Behind the Matrix</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IT9zoa-b0Y</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9IT9zoa-b0Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 18:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections. Hence, knowing SSH client control commands can save you time and boost your productivity when such gotchas occur. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parallels Can Now Run x86 Windows and Linux On Apple Silicon Mac</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/15/0216248/parallels-can-now-run-x86-windows-and-linux-on-apple-silicon-mac?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop now supports running 64-bit x86 operating systems on Apple Silicon Macs through its proprietary emulation engine, enabling users to run traditional Windows and Linux distributions. However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Owns Greenland?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/who-owns-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/678573f83f68018e6a0c098d/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=aK2ez0HAnyG6saKrZTvRIj4SynUteRmJb9DZo3TAn-U" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NuPhy Air60HE keyboard review (Gateron Low-profile Magnetic Jade Pro)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGI03Vdsj5s</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tGI03Vdsj5s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:31:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 7:40 for a typing demonstration.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WqljXZGTfug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

This film asks the question, How do Native Hawaiians in the diaspora keep the feeling of Aloha in their hearts, even when they live thousands of miles away? Dear Aloha follows two Native Hawaiians living in the Pacific Northwest as they reflect on how “Aloha” sustains them amidst distance, loss, and longing. Meanwhile, back in Hawai’i, local residents grapple with the legacy of colonization that has resulted in many Hawaiians being displaced from their homeland.

'HOMEGROWN: A Part Of/Apart From' is a collection of short films from the U.S. territories and Hawaiʻi exploring issues of cultural identity, sovereignty, and agency, as residents and members of the diaspora grapple with what it means to be “a part of and apart from” the mainland U.S.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness— leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

Donald Trump has promised to conduct “the largest deportation effort in American history,” no matter what it costs—but the price tag may be bigger than expected.

In today's video we look at a history of US border control and the economic costs of deporting more than six percent of the US workforce while the US workforce ages.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED5934449149.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Heroku is a cloud platform-as-a-service that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding. Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.💡  Record yourself solving a problem.Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.Interviewers don’t expect perfection—they expect clarity and problem-solving skills.6. And Finally, You Need to Build ResilienceLet’s talk about failure.It’s not if—it’s when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.But every “wrong answer” was a chance to learn something new.💡  Keep a failure journal.Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you’ll tackle similar issues in the future.Failure isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of better solutions.Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:Section for training as a team.Educational section to learn new topics.Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.Slightly advanced topics.The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.If you’ve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life—more on that in this post:Competitive Programming Changed My Life ForeverI’m writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden—a place where I’ve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life…a month ago · 31 likes · 7 comments · Alberto GonzalezYour dream job isn’t just about a bigger paycheck.

To qualify, developers must have a 2024 commit in Torvalds' kernel git tree and email him with the subject "I WANT A GUITAR PEDAL". He'll pick a winner at random, use his own money to buy a pedal kit from a company called Aion FX, and then 'build it with my own shaky little fingers, and send it to the victim by US postal services.'" The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US splits world into three tiers for AI chip access</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/us_digital_flag_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the US government announced a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those manufactured by Nvidia, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mark Zuckerberg Wants to Control Meta AI&apos;s Destiny</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtlAepGdUn8</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EtlAepGdUn8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg says he wants to control his own tech “destiny” by releasing the largest open-source AI model ever, and avoiding the “soul-crushing” tactics of Apple.

Legal Skirmish Continues</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0323229/oracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Oracle has informed us they won't voluntarily withdraw their trademark on 'JavaScript'." That's the word coming from the company behind Deno, the alternative JavaScript/TypeScript/WebAssembly runtime, which is pursuing a formal cancellation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

So what happens next? Oracle "will file their Answer, and we'll start discovery to show how 'JavaScript' is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle." Deno's social media posts show a schedule of various court dates that extend through July of 2026, so "The dispute between Oracle and Deno Land could go on for quite a while," reports InfoWorld:
Deno Land co-founder Ryan Dahl, creator of both the Deno and Node.js runtimes, said a formal answer from Oracle is expected before February 3, unless Oracle extends the deadline again. "After that, we will begin the process of discovery, which is where the real legal work begins. It will be interesting to see how Oracle argues against our claims — genericide, fraud on the USPTO, and non-use of the mark." 

The legal process begins with a discovery conference by March 5, with discovery closing by September 1, followed by pretrial disclosure from October 16 to December 15. An optional request for an oral hearing is due by July 8, 2026. 

Oracle took ownership of JavaScript's trademark in 2009 when it purchased Sun Microsystems, InfoWorld notes. 

But "Oracle does not control (and has never controlled) any aspect of the specification or how the phrase 'JavaScript' can be used by others," argues an official petition filed by Deno Land Inc. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
Today, millions of companies, universities, academics, and programmers, including Petitioner, use "JavaScript" daily without any involvement with Oracle. The phrase "JavaScript" does not belong to one corporation. It belongs to the public. JavaScript is the generic name for one of the bedrock languages of modern programming, and, therefore, the Registered Mark must be canceled. 

An open letter to Oracle discussing the genericness of the phrase "JavaScript," published at https://javascript.tm/, was signed by 14,000+ individuals at the time of this Petition to Cancel, including notable figures such as Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and the current editors of the JavaScript specification, Michael Ficarra and Shu-yu Guo. There is broad industry and public consensus that the term "JavaScript" is generic. 

The seven-page petition goes into great detail, reports InfoWorld. "Deno Land also accused Oracle of committing fraud in its trademark renewal efforts in 2019 by submitting screen captures of the website of JavaScript runtime Node.js, even though Node.js was not affiliated with Oracle."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will Nvidia Spark a New Generation of Linux PCs?</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/006249/will-nvidia-spark-a-new-generation-of-linux-pcs?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 01:07:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["I know, I know: 'Year of the Linux desktop ... yadda, yadda'," writes Steven Vaughan-Nichols, a ZDNet senior contributing editor. "You've heard it all before. But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want..." 

He's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as "a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro."

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players — including Intel and AMD — in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roald Amundsen</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roald-amundsen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6765bf1e575cbdaa9d89bede/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=9jVYK1UV2_PMoWc2X_u4mlskXFK1CvhoaIrf4qRmQGI" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:05:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Lives Matter Rally (Dear Kelly Scene)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc5-B5AFpk</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zmc5-B5AFpk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 20:10:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DEAR KELLY will premiere in three days at 5:55 P.M.

Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.On June 13, 1863, a letter published in The Press newspaper of Christchurch warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently popped up again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the . The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s involved in getting a &quot;modern&quot; terminal setup?</title><link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2025/01/11/getting-a-modern-terminal-setup/</link><author>Julia Evans</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:46:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://jvns.ca/atom.xml">Dev - Julia Evans</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello! Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.My immediate reaction was “oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn’t that
hard, you just need to….”, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
“you just need to…” list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a “modern” terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.what is a “modern terminal experience”?Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:multiline support for copy and paste: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediatly run them all! That’s scary! (, ): if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (): I can’t live without having my  and  in my prompt (): this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours () between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press  in vim to paste (, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too): for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete () (): I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor’s theme. (, )automatic terminal fixing: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn’t get messed up (): I want  to work ( or )being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like : ( and )There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.how I achieve a “modern experience”use the  shell. Mostly don’t configure it, except to:
set the  environment variable to my favourite terminal editoruse any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I’ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I’m not picky about this. I don’t really
configure it other than to choose a font.use , with a configuration that I’ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)A few things that affect my approach:I don’t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machinesI’d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everythingI work on a lot of small projects, not one big projectsome “out of the box” options for a “modern” experienceWhat if you want a nice experience, but don’t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminalmac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn’t have 256-colour support)cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghosttyshell config:
set the  environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editormaybe alias  to text editor: this is a tough one, maybe micro or helix? I haven’t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it’s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
( to copy,  to paste,  to select all) in micro and
they do what you’d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn’t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.Personally I  use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I’ve found in the past that they’re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app’s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.I don’t want to pretend that getting a “modern” terminal experience is easier
than it is though – I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let’s talk
about them!issue 1 with getting to a “modern” experience: the shellbash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:you need to customize your promptthey don’t come with git completions by default, you have to set them upby default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lotI find bash’s tab completion very frustrating, if there’s more than
one match then you can’t tab through themAnd even though I love fish, the fact
that it isn’t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.Of course it’s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn’t even need to be that complicated (in bash I’d
probably start with something like export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ', or maybe use starship).
But each of these “not complicated” things really does add up and it’s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.An extremely popular solution to getting a “modern” shell experience is
oh-my-zsh. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I’ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past – it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what’s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it’s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.issue 2 with getting to a “modern” experience: the text editorIn the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were , , and .I think the main options for terminal text editors are:use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the workuse nano and accept that you’re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don’t think you can select text with the mouse and then “cut”
it in nano)use  or  which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editorjust avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode’s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use  as their  in the terminal.issue 3: individual applicationsThe last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine,  doesn’t support
the  keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:realize why this is happening (Mac OS won’t ship GNU tools, and “Ctrl-Left arrow” support comes from GNU readline)find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)adjust my environment (put Homebrew’s sqlite3 in my PATH)I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn’t feel “worth it” – often I’ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don’t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I’ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.A big part of having a “modern” experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can’t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in , but in   I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more “modern” command line tools isn’t easy (though
I made a list here),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you’re
SSHed into another machine, they won’t always be there.everything affects everything elseSomething I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything “nice”
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don’t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I’d need to think about a few things, like:if I wanted tmux’s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I’d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has OSC 52 supportif I wanted to use iTerm’s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I’d need to change how I configure colours – right now I set them
with a shell script that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.and probably more things I haven’t thought of. “Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours” sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided “well, I don’t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I’m not using that feature!”.It’s also hard to remember which features I’m relying on – for example maybe
my current terminal  have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don’t even realize that that’s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.Personally even though I think my setup is not  complicated, it’s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I’ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there’s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using  to eza a year or two ago and
while I like it (because  prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I’m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it’s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I’m
very happy I did.getting a “modern” terminal is not that easyTrying to explain how “easy” it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it’s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.I’ve found that there’s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Keychron Q0 Max macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPk09Ars-JE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xPk09Ars-JE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-max-qmk-custom-number-pad

RFK, Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. 

The US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. 

Fluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains — and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.

Though there are more fixed and mobile telephone connections, even they use Internet technology in their core. For all the many uses the Internet allows for today, its origins lie in the cold war and the need for a defense communications network that could survive a nuclear strike. But that defense communications network quickly became used for general communications and within only a few years of the first transmission, traffic on the predecessor to today’s Internet was already 75 percent email.Arpanet was the vital precursor of today’s Internet, commissioned by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1969. In his interesting account of why Arpanet came about, Stephen Lukasic, director of DARPA from 1970–75, wrote that if its true nature and impact had been realized it would never have been permitted under the US government structure of the time. The concept for a decentralized communications technology that would survive a nuclear attack would have placed it outside DARPA’s remit (as defense communications specifically were assigned to a different agency), so the focus changed to how to connect computers together so that major applications could be run on the most appropriate system available.This was in the era of time-sharing computers. Today’s familiar world of the ubiquitous “personal computer” on each desk was decades away. Computers of this time were generally very large, filling entire rooms, and comparatively rare. Users working at connected terminals would submit jobs to the computer that would allocate processing time for the job when available. The idea went that if these computers were networked together, an available remote computer could process a job even when the computers closer to the users were full. The resulting network was called Arpanet, and the first packets of data traversed the network in September 1969.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The dark history of arsenic - Neil Bradbury</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH0tUg4Enn0</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qH0tUg4Enn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2025 16:01:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the history of arsenic dating back to ancient civilizations, and find out why this element is known as the king of poisons.

--

No substance has been as constant an ally to insidious scheming as arsenic, the so-called “king of poisons.” In its chemically pure form, it isn’t much of a threat because our bodies don’t absorb it well; it’s when arsenic combines with other elements that things get dangerous. So, how did this substance become such a popular poison? Neil Bradbury digs into the element's sordid and lethal history.

Overall, I was satisfied with it, despite some strange recent updates like adding AI features, KeyChain integration, and security vulnerabilities.In recent years, new terminal emulators have appeared. I tried using them mainly for testing macmon. A couple of years ago, I tried switching to kitty, which was faster due to GPU acceleration. However, it required too much customization and still looked very non-native for macOS. GPU acceleration was added to iTerm as well, so I stayed with it.I also tried Alacritty, but it is very basic and lacks the features I need. Recently, I tested Ghostty, which has gained huge attention – it has nice defaults, but its RAM usage is concerning (around 250MB per empty tab). Currently, it also lacks buffer search, which makes the terminal useless for me.I heard a lot of positive feedback about WezTerm from bobuk. So I decided to try it out and use it for some time – and I am very satisfied with it.The next part of the article will be about how to make WezTerm understandable for iTerm users to try it or switch completely.WezTerm can be installed from Homebrew:When you first open WezTerm, it looks plain, non-native, and not very functional. But actually, it has everything you need. This is because WezTerm is cross-platform, unlike iTerm2, so the author left minimal default settings, leaving the rest of the configuration to the user. My goal is to achieve a similar experience in WezTerm as I had in iTerm.WezTerm does not have a graphical interface for configuration, and the setup is done through a Lua file (this is unusual for me, but Vim users are familiar with it). The configuration file can be located at  or ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua. I prefer the second path because it is where Fish and starship store configs too.Create a configuration file:And then add the boilerplate code for configuration:First, I want to change the default font, its size, and disable ligatures (because it's important to see the actual characters in case of some logs).Save the file, and the changes should be applied immediately (yes, no reload required!).Next, I want to change the theme and set it to follow the current system theme automatically. For the past year, I have been using Catppuccin themes, and I am very happy with them. They rarely have issues where some text colors blend with the background. To make the theme switch automatically based on the current system theme, we need to write a small Lua function (I copied it from the documentation):I forgot to mention that the Catppuccin theme, like many other popular themes, is pre-installed in WezTerm, so you don't need to install it separately like in iTerm, which is very cool. Of course, you can also set up your own colors.The default padding also seems a bit large, so let's make it smaller. I also had a Blinking Line Cursor (I don't remember if this is the default or not in iTerm). Let's set both configurations:In iTerm, I used the Minimal theme to save vertical space for tabs. We can do the same in WezTerm (the default tabs don't look very good). Also possible to add some transparency and blur to the window. I didn't use this in iTerm, but let's try it now:In iTerm, I usually set large values for Cols/Rows to make the start window bigger. This approach is a bit outdated, so let's make the window open in full screen when the terminal starts.Finally, the most important part is setting up hotkeys – it's hard to give up what you've been used to for years. An important thing for me is Split Panels with  / .  should close the current active panel, not the whole tab.  – clear the current screen.  /  for start/end of the line. I think these are all defaults from iTerm, so let's make them the same in WezTerm:WezTerm also has a Command Execution menu. I haven't used it much yet, but just in case, I bind it to the same keys as in VSCode / Zed – .Note: In the configuration, the  value is case-sensitive, so  and  are different things (basically  is the same as ). I initially got confused with this.Overall, I am very satisfied with WezTerm and have fully switched to using it daily. One cool feature I want to mention is the quick connect to servers in Known hosts via SSH (Command Palette → type server name → Enter OR Nav Bar → Shell → Click on server name). WezTerm also has Workspaces – an alternative to tmux, but I haven't used it actively yet.Here a gist with the final config from this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here’s how hucksters are manipulating Google to promote shady Chrome extensions</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/googles-chrome-web-store-has-a-serious-spam-problem-promoting-shady-extensions/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chrome-web-store-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 23:46:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The people overseeing the security of Google’s Chrome browser explicitly forbid third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the Chrome Web Store.

As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.Not looking?

For years, the auto industry has been hyping the transition to electric vehicles with optimistic sales forecasts for electric models and huge growth projections. Investors pumped up valuations for automakers, based on their visions for an electric future.

Now the hype is dwindling, and companies are again cheering consumer choice. Automakers from Ford Motor and General Motors to Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo are scaling back or delaying their electric vehicle plans.

Tesla’s annual vehicle deliveries declined for the first time in more than a decade during a period when overall car sales are up. Have automakers overinvested in EVs and are EVs killing the car industry?

She was every bit a woman of her time, engaging in the overblown sentimentality and culture of death so pervasive during the age that bears her name. When she died at 81, the queen left secret, detailed instructions on how to handle her body and what items to place in her coffin. There are, indeed, a number of strange Queen Victoria death facts worth exploring.

But this did not apply to the armed services until January 2000 – prior to that being queer in the British military was not only illegal but would have resulted in a possible jail term and instant dismissal. Lee Arnott has studied the gay experience within the military between 1969 and the present day. In this video, we look at why it took so long for the British military to lift the ban.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, there was a sports journalist named Maria.She had to travel often by flight for work.But one day she lost her luggage during a flight, and couldn’t track it. So she was sad and upset.She hears about a tracking device, called Apple AirTag, from a coworker.And bought it immediately, she was dazzled by its simplicity in tracking luggage.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re also on Bluesky:An AirTag contains a low-power CPU and a tiny amount of memory.A tracking device must send its accurate location data at regular intervals.Yet finding location data using GPS, WiFI, or cellular networks consumes power. Besides it’s expensive to maintain a tracking device with GPS functionality.So smart engineers at Apple used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.An AirTag doesn’t use GPS, WiFi, or a cellular network for communication; instead, it uses Bluetooth Low Energy ().Imagine BLE as a low-power wireless technology for communication.The key pair is shared between AirTag and the user account. The AirTag sends location data after encrypting it using the public key. While the user account decrypts the received location data using the private key.Think of the  as an email address; anyone can send messages to it. While the  is similar to the password of an inbox; only the user with the password can read emails.And authenticity of an email can be verified by checking the sender’s email address: .2. Broadcasting AirTag’s LocationThey send the AirTag’s location, which is near its owner’s iPhone, using Bluetooth, or Ultra Wideband for precision and efficiency.Think of  as a wireless technology for high-speed, and short-range communication.Yet Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband communication won’t work if the owner’s iPhone is far from the AirTag. So they rely on someone else's iPhone which is nearby.The AirTag broadcasts its public key every 2 seconds over BLE.Someone else’s iPhone, which is nearby, receives the broadcast signal. The iPhone encrypts its location data and timestamp using the received public key.The iPhone uploads the encrypted data to the Apple server over HTTP.Put simply, AirTag doesn’t send location data; instead, only the public key. The iPhone then includes its location data and encrypts it.3. Finding AirTag’s LocationThe owner can find AirTag’s location using their iPhone app.The owner authenticates on the Apple server.The owner requests location data for a specific public key.The owner decrypts the received location data using their private key.The iPhone then displays AirTag’s recent location on a map.An iPhone is necessary to relay location data, so an AirTag won’t work if there aren’t any iPhones nearby.Put simply, the precision and effectiveness of an AirTag depends on the number of iPhones in its proximity.While there are around 1.46 billion iPhone users in the world.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in February 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

Our family made eight $1 million donations to nonprofit groups working to support those most currently in need:Team Rubicon – Mobilizing veterans to continue their service, leveraging their skills and experience to help Americans prepare, respond, and recover from natural disasters.Children's Hunger Fund – Provides resources to local churches in the United States and around the world to meet the needs of impoverished community members.PEN America – Defends writers against censorship and abuse, supports writers in need of emergency assistance, and amplifies the writing of incarcerated prisoners. (One of my personal favorites; I've seen the power of writing transform our world many times.)The Trevor Project – Working to change hearts, minds, and laws to support the lives of young adults seeking acceptance as fellow Americans.First Generation Investors –Introduces high school students in low-income areas to the fundamentals of investing, providing them real money to invest, encouraging long-term wealth accumulation and financial literacy among underserved youth.Global Refuge – Supporting migrants and refugees from around the globe, in partnership with community-based legal and social service providers nationwide, helping rebuild lives in America.Planned Parenthood – Provides essential healthcare services and resources that help individuals and families lead healthier lives.I encourage every American to contribute soon, however you can, to organizations you feel are those most currently in need here in America.We must alsowork toward deeper changes that will take decades to achieve. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth towards long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to the American Dream. I never thought my family would be able to do this. My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson.During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the federal minimum wage, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with lower in-state tuition, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. College tuition at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These huge cost increases for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen in 2008 when we built Stack Overflow, a Q&A website for programmers creating a shared Creative Commons knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that's the American way. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using ranked choice voting. We built a  – of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. It worked. With the guidance of my co-founder Joel Spolsky, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for Discourse, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to set boundaries the community agrees on, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. Digital democracy , for everyone.In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.I've always felt Stack Overflow and Discourse are projects for the public good that happen to be corporations. I probably couldn't have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck. That's what the American Dream promises us. I recently attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son's public high school. All I really knew was the famous "stay gold" line from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant:  the American Dream. In the printed program, the director wrote:This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity. Whether you've read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.Stay gold.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix captured this distortion so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, enough of us voted for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don't understand.I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively keeping America fair for everyone. Our status as the world's leading democracy is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as  so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because . We don't have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.Even with the wealth I have, I can't imagine what it would feel like to be a billionaireIt is, for lack of a better word, In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country's wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined.I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things that :Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile booksMore than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete. When would this wealth be transferred? November 5th raised the stakes. It is now time to allocate  I was so fortunate to be dealt within the next five years not just for my own family, but for all my fellow Americans. Our government seems to be slower and slower at delivering change due to the increased polarization of our two party system. The last meaningful constitutional amendment we've managed to pass in the last 60 years was the 26th amendment in 1971, lowering the voting age to 18 and giving more people a voice in our democracy. I've always loved the ideals behind the American Dream, though we continually struggle to live up to them. They are worth fighting for, even if it means making "good trouble". We must come together and believe in our shared American Dream so deeply that we can improve our democracy... but which dream?The American Dream contains the path of hate, and the path of love. Throughout our history, one hand is always fighting the other. Which path are we choosing?Our family pledges half our remaining wealth toward an American Dream founded on love.Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.We could found a new organization loosely based on the original RAND Corporation, but modernized like Lever for Change. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for  working within the current system or outside it.We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.We've already completed the eight $1 million donations listed above to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together. I will gladly advise and working towards the same goal.Please join us in Sharing the American Dream:Support organizations you feel are effectively helping those most in need across America right now.Within the next five years, also contribute public dedications of time or funds towards longer term efforts to keep the American Dream fair and attainable for all our children.(I could not have done this without the support of my partner Betsy Burton and the rest of my family. I'd also like to thank Steve McConnell, whose writing inspired me to start this blog in 2004. So many people from all walks of life generously shared their feedback to improve this post. We wrote it together. Thank you all.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 big predictions for 2025 (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/126</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/126/changelog-news-126.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[M.G.

He added, "We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies."Both statements are notable coming from Altman, who has served as the leader of OpenAI during the rise of mainstream generative AI products such as ChatGPT. AI agents are the latest marketing trend in AI, allowing AI models to take action on a user's behalf.

 In November the Steam Survey reflected a 2.03% marketshare for Linux... Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. 

 In fact, December "saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey," according to TechSpot — "up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%..."
Elsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.
Rounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... 

Phoronix adds that the Windows percent "pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>All Of The Ways The Ocean Can Kill You</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcycbWnNlU</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PCcycbWnNlU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 5 Jan 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ocean.

With over 3,000 problems, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lost.Which problems should you solve? How many problems are enough for coding interviews?How much time should you spend on each problem?I will answer these questions and more in this article to make your journey smoother, and lot less less painful.For context - I’ve solved more than 1,500 LeetCode problems and cleared interviews at multiple big tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and in this article I’ll share everything I’ve learned to help you start and navigate LeetCode more effectively.I’ll share practical tips and resources to help you save time, stay focused and build your problem-solving skills without feeling overwhelmed.Why do you even need LeetCode?You might be wondering: why is everyone doing LeetCode questions. Is it really necessary to land a Software Engineering job?The short answer is: .There are plenty of startups and smaller companies that focus more on your experience with specific tech stacks and the projects you’ve built. They might not even include LeetCode style questions in their interview process.But if your goal is to work at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, you would need to practice LeetCode style questions since that’s what they ask in their interviews.Which programming language to choose?This is a question I get asked all the time.Many people get stuck at deciding which programming language to use.But here’s the truth: It doesn’t really matter. A programming language is just a tool. Once you understand the approach to solving a problem, you can implement it in any language.In my experience giving interviews, unless the job specifically requires expertise in a certain language, you’ll be fine using any language you’re comfortable with.The point is, LeetCode isn’t about syntax. It’s about using the right data structures, algorithms, and your ability to think critically and solve problems.That said, if you’re new to coding, I recommend starting with  It’s beginner-friendly and has a simpler syntax.If you already know a language—stick with it. Whether it’s C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go, there’s no need to switch.You don’t need to be an expert in your chosen language, but you should know the basics like:and input/output operationsBeyond the basics, spend some time learning the  for common data structures and algorithms.These libraries save time and let you focus on solving the problem rather than reimplementing data structures from scratch.Python has lists, dictionaries, and sets.Java has ArrayList, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.C++ offers the STL library with vector, map, and set.Before diving into LeetCode problems, it’s good to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.Basic Data Structures like Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.and Fundamental Algorithms like Sorting techniques, binary search, and recursion.Recursion is particularly important, since many problems specially tree and graph related ones rely heavily on it.When you’re familiar with these topics, it becomes much easier to recognize which concept applies to a specific problem.You don’t need to dive too deeply into every topic upfront. Most of your understanding will develop naturally as you solve problems.There are plenty of resources available online to help you get started. Don’t waste time searching for the “perfect” resource—pick one and start learning.The focus should always be on progress, not perfection.Here are some resources I personally found quite useful: It’s my second channel where I upload animated tutorials on DSA and LeetCode patterns.Here’s a comprehensive list of DSA topics you should know for coding interviews:Learn one topic at a timeIf you’re a beginner, focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.For example: Start with , the move to , then progress to more complex topics like , , and .This approach helps you develop a deeper understanding of each topic and teaches you how to recognize when to use a particular data structure or algorithm.Once you’ve learned the basics of a topic and understand how to implement it from scratch, it’s time to put your knowledge to the test.Solve 4-5 easy problems related to that topic on LeetCode.and Build confidence in applying the concepts.If you want to learn more about how to master a DSA topic, you can check out this article where I discuss it in more detail:Which problems should you solve?If you open LeetCode, there are over That number alone can feel overwhelming. So, how do you decide which ones to solve?Start with  for each topic. These are perfect for building confidence and understanding the basics of problem-solving.Once you’re comfortable with the easy ones, gradually challenge yourself with slightly harder problems that push you beyond your comfort zone.Remember, real growth happens when you constantly Don’t worry about hard problems in the beginning.Most coding interviews focus on , so that’s where you should spend the majority of your time.These lists are excellent, and I highly recommend solving every problem on them.How many problems should you solve?There’s no magic number, but from my experience,  is the sweet spot.However, it’s not about solving just any 300 problems. Focus on  that cover the most topics and patterns.To make it easier for you, I’ve created a : a curated list of the Top 300 LeetCode Problems organized into that are most commonly asked in coding interviews.You can find it on  Just head to the practice page. You will see a structured list  that you can follow from top to bottom.Resources to help you learn the topics.Ability to track your progress and mark problems for future revision.Links to GitHub and YouTube solutions.and ability to filter problems based on pattern, difficulty level and status.Don’t rush through problems just to increase your count. Instead of focusing on the quantity of problems you solve, focus on what you learn from each problem.It’s far better to deeply understand and solve 50 problems than to superficially solve 500 problems.After solving a problem, ask yourself:Why does this solution work?What’s the one key insight that made everything else easier?Also, try to make it fun. There is a fun in learning to solve coding challenges. It’s not just about getting a job.Focus on learning PatternsThe key to getting better at LeetCode is learningas manypatterns as possible.Instead of focusing on individual questions, focus on identifying  that connect similar problems.On LeetCode, you’ll come across multiple problems that follow a similar patterns. Once you solve one of them, you can apply the same approach to solve others.For example: After learning the monotonic stack , I was able to solve over 10 similar problems.I made a  covering the 15 most important LeetCode patterns I learned after solving over 1,500 problems. You can check it out later.On , I’ve categorized problems by pattern. This makes it easy to focus on one pattern at a time. By going through the list, you will get to know all the important patterns for coding interviews.How to approach a new problem?1. Read the Problem Statement TwiceThe first time, focus on getting the big picture. What is the problem asking you to do?On the second read, pay attention to specific constraints and conditions. These small details often provide clues for optimizing your solution.2. Analyze the Input and Output ExamplesCarefully go through the examples provided in the problem.Walk through the input and output step by step to understand how the problem works. I have found that, many times simply walking through a few examples helped me figure out the solution.3. Visualize with pen and paperMany problems specially the ones related to trees and graphs are much easier to understand when you draw them out.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios and input sizes. Think about any  that might come up.4. Start with a Brute Force ApproachDon’t expect to come up with the most optimal solution right away.First see, if you can solve the problems using a brute force approach. While it might not be efficient, it gives you a baseline to improve upon.5. Optimize Your SolutionOnce you have a brute force solution, focus on optimizing it.Here are few things to consider:Leverage Unused Information: Look for details you might have missed. For instance, if the problem states that the array is sorted, consider leveraging this to use binary search or a two-pointer approach.: If certain calculations are repeated multiple times, consider precomputing them. Use techniques like  or  to avoid redundant calculations. Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.Make Time vs. Space Tradeoffs: Sometimes, using additional memory (e.g., hash tables) can speed up your solution.Data Structure Brainstorm: Run through the popular data structures and try to apply each one to the problem at hand.Avoid overcomplicating your solution. At every stage ask yourself, "Is there a simpler way to do this?". This will not only make your solution easier to understand but it will also reduce the chances of errors during coding.7. Analyze Time and Space ComplexityDevelop the habit of analyzing the time and space complexity of every problem you submit.How much time should you spend on each problem?When you’re just starting out, even  can take a while to solve. That’s completely normal—don’t get discouraged if you can’t come up with a solution right away.Your main goal in the beginning should be to  and understanding the problem deeply. Real progress happens when you take the time to think, make mistakes and refine your approach.But, some problems involve specific tricks or patterns that are hard to figure out unless you’ve seen them before.Spending hours on such problems without progress can be counterproductive.Here’s a good rule of thumb:Give yourself  of focused effort for each problem.If you’re still stuck, it’s okay to look at hints or solutions.Read the official solution and and try to understand the top voted solutions on LeetCode discussion forum.Don’t just move on after viewing the solution. Try to grasp why the solution works.Rewrite the solution from scratch without looking at the code. Writing it yourself helps you internalize the approach and ensures you truly understand it.If you couldn’t solve the problem on your first attempt, mark it for  and revisit it after a few weeks. Revisiting problems helps reinforce your understanding and ensures long-term retention.One of the most common mistakes—one that I made myself—is  to difficult problems and moving on.At first, it might seem like a shortcut, but in reality, it’s a  for three main reasons:You’ll quickly forget memorized solutions. Without understanding the logic behind them, they won’t stick in your memory.Your problem-solving skills won’t improve. Memorization skips the critical thinking process, which is the real value of practicing coding problems.You’ll struggle in interviews. Most interviewers ask variants of problems or follow-up questions, and without a deep understanding, you won’t be able to adapt.Instead of memorizing, focus on understanding the solution, even if it takes hours.Break it down step by step and ask yourself:Why does this approach work?What’s the key insight that simplifies the problem?How can I apply this approach to similar problems?This effort pays off in the long term. The deeper your understanding, the more confident you’ll feel explaining your thought process during interviews.Practice in a timed environmentSolving a problem during an interview is very different from solving it from the comfort of your home.That’s why it’s a good idea to time-box yourself and practice in a timed environment after you have learned the basics and solved 100-150 problems.Simply turn on a timer while practicing and try to complete the problem within that time.For , aim to complete them in For , set a timer for For , allow yourself To take your practice a step further:Try  by simulating past LeetCode contests.It’s okay if you struggle to solve even one problem initially—this is normal. The goal is to gain experience solving problems within a time limit.When I started participating in contests, I could only solve 1-2 problems. But with consistent practice, I improved to solving 3 problems, and eventually, I was able to solve all of them in some contests.Getting good at LeetCode isn’t just about learning new concepts or solving problems—it’s also about retaining that knowledge over time.That’s why you should regularly revisit concepts and problems you’ve already solved, especially the ones you found challenging.Try to solve those problems again without looking at the solution.By practicing consistently and revisiting old problems, you’ll make it much easier to retain what you’ve learned over time.I discuss more about how to effectively revise LeetCode problems in this article, so make sure to check it out: Getting good at LeetCode takes time.Some topics might take weeks or even months to master, and that’s okay. Be patient with yourself and remember: It’s completely normal to feel stuck or frustrated when working on a tough problem or grasping a complex topic.If a problem feels too hard, take a break, then come back to it with a fresh perspective.The more you practice, the better you will get at solving LeetCode problems.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>3 Hours Of Facts About The World Wars</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qU7wOvwJvU</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3qU7wOvwJvU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 4 Jan 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[00:00:00 - Switzerland and WWII: An Exemplary Neutrality?
