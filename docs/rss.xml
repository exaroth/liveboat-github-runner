If you are still running Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, this is the end of the road. LibreOffice will not run on those systems anymore, and there are no workarounds. The suite has slammed the door shut.
 
For years, LibreOffice kept older Windows users afloat while Microsoft and other developers moved on. That lifeline is gone. Anyone stubbornly clinging to Windows 7 or 8 now has two choices: upgrade or stay stuck on outdated software. LibreOffice has made it clear that it will not carry dead platforms any further. And the cuts do not stop there. 32-bit Windows builds are on their way out, with deprecation already in place. On the Mac side, 25.8 is the last release that runs on macOS 10.15. Starting with LibreOffice 26.2, only macOS 11 and newer will be supported. In other words, if your computer is too old to run modern systems, LibreOffice is walking away.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I built Puhu, a pillow drop-in replacement in Rust</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mxx8nu/i_built_puhu_a_pillow_dropin_replacement_in_rust/</link><author>/u/creworker</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 09:48:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey All, I’m a python developer and recently learning rust.

Zelenskyy was speaking during a visit to Kyiv by NATO chief Mark Rutte to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine.

The catch? These minerals, such as cobalt, lithium, gallium and rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, are currently being discarded as tailings of other mineral streams like gold and zinc, said Elizabeth Holley, associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines and lead author of the new paper.
 
To conduct the analysis, Holley and her team built a database of annual production from federally permitted metal mines in the U.S. They used a statistical resampling technique to pair these data with the geochemical concentrations of critical minerals in ores, recently compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, Geoscience Australia and the Geologic Survey of Canada. Using this approach, Holley's team was able to estimate the quantities of critical minerals being mined and processed every year at U.S. metal mines but not being recovered. Instead, these valuable minerals are ending up as discarded tailings that must be stored and monitored to prevent environmental contamination.
 
The analysis looks at a total of 70 elements used in applications ranging from consumer electronics like cell phones to medical devices to satellites to renewable energy to fighter jets and shows that unrecovered byproducts from other U.S. mines could meet the demand for all but two -- platinum and palladium. Among the elements included in the analysis are:
- Cobalt (Co): The lustrous bluish-gray metal, a key component in electric car batteries, is a byproduct of nickel and copper mining. Recovering less than 10% of the cobalt currently being mined and processed but not recovered would be more than enough to fuel the entire U.S. battery market.
- Germanium (Ge): The brittle silvery-white semi-metal used for electronics and infrared optics, including sensors on missiles and defense satellites, is present in zinc and molybdenum mines. If the U.S. recovered less than 1% of the germanium currently mined and processed but not recovered from U.S. mines, it would not have to import any germanium to meet industry needs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Upgrading cluster in-place coz I am too lazy to do blue-green</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1mxuf5v/upgrading_cluster_inplace_coz_i_am_too_lazy_to_do/</link><author>/u/suman087</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:50:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;m too dumb for Zig&apos;s new IO interface</title><link>https://www.openmymind.net/Im-Too-Dumb-For-Zigs-New-IO-Interface/</link><author>begoon</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:39:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You might have heard that Zig 0.15 introduces a new IO interface, with the focus for this release being the new std.Io.Reader and std.Io.Writer types. The old "interfaces" had problems. Like this performance issue that I opened. And it relied on a mix of types, which always confused me, and a lot of  - which is generally great, but a poor foundation to build an interface on.I've been slowly upgrading my libraries, and I ran into changes to the  client used by my smtp library. For the life of me, I just don't understand how it works.Zig has never been known for its documentation, but if we look at the documentation for , we'll find:input output options InitErrorClient
Initiates a TLS handshake  establishes a TLSv1 TLSv1 sessionSo it takes one of these new Readers and a new Writer, along with some options (sneak peak, which aren't all optional). It doesn't look like you can just give it a , but  does expose a  and  method, so that's probably a good place to start: stream  stdnetallocator stream writer  stream reader  stream tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient
  readerwriterinterfaceNote that  returns a  and  returns a  - those aren't the types our  expects. To convert the  to an , we need to call its  method. To get a  from an , we need the address of its  field. This doesn't seem particularly consistent. Don't forget that the  and  need a stable address. Because I'm trying to get the simplest example working, this isn't an issue - everything will live on the stack of . In a real word example, I think it means that I'll always have to wrap the  into my own heap-allocated type; giving the writer and reader have a cozy stable home.Speaking of allocations, you might have noticed that  and  take a parameter. It's the buffer they should use. Buffering is a first class citizen of the new Io interface - who needs composition? The documentation  tell me these need to be at least std.crypto.tls.max_ciphertext_record_len large, so we need to fix things a bit: write_buf writer  streamwrite_buf read_buf reader  streamread_bufHere's where the code stands:  std  gpa stdheapinit allocator  gpa stream  stdnetallocator stream write_buf writer  streamwrite_buf read_buf reader  streamread_buf tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient
      readerwriterinterface tls_clientBut if you try to run it, you'll get a compilation error. Turns out we have to provide 4 options: the ca_bundle, a host, a  and a . Normally I'd expect the options parameter to be for optional parameters, I don't understand why some parameters (input and output) are passed one way while  and  are passed another.Let's give it what it wants AND send some data: bundle  bundleallocator bundleallocator tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient
  readerwriterinterfaceca bundle  bundlehost explicit read_buffer write_buffer  tls_client tls_clientwriterNow, if I try to run it, the program just hangs. I don't know what  is, but I know Zig now loves buffers, so let's try to give it something: write_buf2 tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient
  readerwriterinterfaceca bundle  bundlehost explicit read_buffer write_buffer write_buf2 tls_client tls_clientwriterGreat, now the code doesn't hang, all we need to do is read the response.  exposes a  field which is "Decrypted stream from the server to the client." That sounds like what we want, but believe it or not  doesn't have a  method. It has a  a , a  (which seems close, but it blocks until the provided buffer is full), a  and a lot more, but nothing like the  I'd expect. The closest I can find, which I think does what I want, is to stream it to a writer: buf wbuf n  tls_clientreaderwbuflen
stddebugn bufnIf we try to run the code now, it crashes. We've apparently failed an assertion regarding the length of a buffer. So it seems like we also  to provide a .Here's my current version (it doesn't work, but it doesn't crash!): std  gpa stdheapinit allocator  gpa stream  stdnetallocator stream write_buf writer  streamwrite_buf read_buf reader  streamread_buf bundle  bundleallocator bundleallocator write_buf2 read_buf2 tls_client  stdcryptotlsClient
      readerwriterinterfaceca bundle  bundlehost explicit read_buffer read_buf2write_buffer write_buf2 tls_client tls_clientwriter buf wbuf n  tls_clientreaderwbuflen
  stddebugn bufnWhen I looked through Zig's source code, there's only one place using . It helped to get me where where I am. I couldn't find any tests.I'll admit that during this migration, I've missed some basic things. For example, someone had to help me find  - the renamed version of . Maybe there's a helper like: tls.Client.init(allocator, stream) somewhere. And maybe it makes sense that we do  but  - I'm reminded of Go's  and . And maybe Zig has some consistent rule for what parameters belong in options. And I know nothing about TLS, so maybe it makes complete sense to need 4 buffers. I feel a bit more confident about the weirdness of not having a  function on , but at this point I wouldn't bet on me.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Myths and realities of Irish reunification | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjX54qx2fg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3fjX54qx2fg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:32:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The debate over Irish unification is heating up as supporters argue the time has come to plan for what a united Ireland could look like.

unheard of, for a GitHub issue to spark an uproar.  That happened over the past month or so as the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, which I still say should have called themselves a Task Force instead) issue “Should we remove XSLT from the web platform?” was opened, debated, and eventually locked once the comment thread started spiraling into personal attacks.  Other discussions have since opened, such as  a counterproposal to update XSLT in the web platform, thankfully with (thus far) much less heat.If you’re new to the term, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is an XML language that lets you transform one document tree structure into another.  If you’ve ever heard of people styling their RSS and/or Atom feeds to look nice in the browser, they were using some amount of XSLT to turn the RSS/Atom into HTML, which they could then CSS into prettiness.This is not the only use case for XSLT, not by a long shot, but it does illustrate the sort of thing XSLT is good for.  So why remove it, and who got this flame train rolling in the first place?Before I start, I want to note that in this post, I won’t be commenting on whether or not XSLT support should be dropped from browsers or not.  I’m also not going to be systematically addressing the various reactions I’ve seen to all this.  I have my own biases around this — some of them in direct conflict with each other! — but my focus here will be on what’s happened so far and what might lie ahead.As a very quick background, various people have proposed removing XSLT support from browsers a few times over the quarter-century-plus since support first landed.  It was discussed in both the early and mid-2010s, for example.  At this point, browsers all more or less supportXSLT 1.0, whereas the latest version of XSLT is 3.0.  I believe they all do so with C++ code, which is therefore not memory-safe, that is baked into the code base rather than supported via some kind of plugged-in library, like Firefox using  PDF.js to support PDFs in the browser.Anyway, back on August 1st, Mason Freed of Google opened issue #11523 on WHATWG’s HTML repository, asking if XSLT should be removed from browsers and giving a condensed set of reasons why it might be a good idea.  He also included a WASM-based polyfill he’d written to provide XSLT support, should browsers remove it, and opened “ Investigate deprecation and removal of XSLT” in the Chromium bug tracker.“So it’s already been decided and we just have to bend over and take the changes our Googlish overlords have decreed!” many people shouted.  It’s not hard to see where they got that impression, given some of the things Google has done over the years, but that’s  what’s happening here.  Not at this point.  I’d like to set some records straight, as an outside observer of both Google and the issue itself.First of all, while Mason was the one to open the issue, this was done because the idea was raised in a periodic WHATNOT meeting (call), where someone at Mozilla was actually the one to bring it up, after it had come up in various conversations over the previous few months.  After Mason opened the issue, members of the Mozilla and WebKit teams expressed (tentative, mostly) support for the idea of exploring this removal.  Basically,  of the vendors are particularly keen on keeping native XSLT support in their codebases, particularly after  security flaws were found in XSLT implementations.This isn’t the first time they’ve all agreed it might be nice to slim their codebases down a little by removing something that doesn’t get a lot of use (relatively speaking), and it won’t be the last.  I bet they’ve all talked at some point about how nice it would be to remove BMP support.Mason mentioned that they didn’t have resources to put toward updating their XSLT code, and got widely derided for it. “Google has trillions of dollars!” people hooted.   has trillions of dollars.  The Chrome team very much does not.  They probably get, at best, a tiny fraction of one percent of those dollars.  Whether Google should give the Chrome team more money is essentially irrelevant, because that’s not in the Chrome team’s control.  They have what they have, in terms of head count and time, and have to decide how those entirely finite resources are best spent.(I will once again invoke my late-1900s formulation of Hanlon’s Razor:  Never attribute to malice that which can be more adequately explained by resource constraints.)Second of all, the issue was opened to start a discussion and gather feedback as the first stage of a multi-step process, one that could easily run for years.  Google, as I assume is true for other browser makers, has a pretty comprehensive method for working out whether removing a given feature is tenable or not.  Brian and I  talked with Rick Byers about it a while back, and I was impressed by both how many things been removed, and what they do to make sure they’re removing the right things.Here’s one (by no means the only!) way they could go about this:Set up a switch that allows XSLT to be disabled.In the next release of Chrome, use the switch to disable XSLT in one percent of all Chrome downloads.See if any bug reports come in about it.  If so, investigate further and adjust as necessary if the problems are not actually about XSLT.If not, up the percentage of XSLT-disabled downloads a little bit at a time over a number of releases.  If no bugs are reported as the percentage of XSLT-disabled users trends toward 100%, then prepare to remove it entirely.If, on the other hand, it becomes clear that removing XSLT will be a widely breaking change  —  where “widely” can still mean a very tiny portion of their total user base — then XSLT can be re-enabled for all users as soon as possible, and the discussion taken back up with this new information in hand.Again, that is just one of several approaches Google could take, and it’s a lot simpler than what they would most likely actually do, but it’s roughly what they default to, as I understand it.  The process is slow and deliberate, building up a picture of actual use and user experience.Third of all, opening a bug that includes a pull request of code changes isn’t a declaration of countdown to merge, it’s a way of making crystal clear (to those who can read the codebase) exactly what the proposal would entail.  It’s basically a requirement for the process of making a decision to start, because it sets the exact parameters of what’s being decided on.That said, as a result of all this, I now strongly believe that every proposed-removal issue should point to the process and where the issue stands in it. (And write down the process if it hasn’t been already.) This isn’t for the issue’s intended audience, which was other people within WHATWG who are familiar with the usual process and each other, but for cases of context escape, like happened here.  If a removal discussion is going to be held in public, then it should assume the general public will see it and provide enough context for the general public to understand the actual nature of the discussion.  In the absence of that context, the nature of the discussion will be assumed, and every assumption will be different.There is one thing that we should all keep in mind, which is that “remove from the web platform” really means “remove from browsers”.  Even if this proposal goes through, XSLT could still be used server-side.  You could use libraries that support XSLT versions more recent than 1.0, even!  Thus, XML could still be turned into HTML, just not in the client via native support, though JS or WASM polyfills, or even add-on extensions, would still be an option.  Is that good or bad?  Like everything else in our field, the answer is “it depends”.Just in case your eyes glazed over and you quickly skimmed to see if there was a TL;DR, here it is:The discussion was opened by a Google employee in response to interest from multiple browser vendors in removing built-in XSLT, following a process that is opaque to most outsiders.  It’s a first step in a multi-step evaluation process that can take years to complete, and whose outcome is not predetermined.  Tempers flared and the initial discussion was locked; the conversation continues elsewhere.  There are good reasons to drop native XSLT support in browsers, and also good reasons to keep or update it, but XSLT is not itself at risk.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Coinbase CEO explains why he fired engineers who didn’t try AI immediately</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/coinbase-ceo-explains-why-he-fired-engineers-who-didnt-try-ai-immediately/</link><author>/u/diegoargento1</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 04:43:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s hard to find programmers these days who aren’t using AI coding assistants in some capacity, especially to write the repetitive, mundane bits.But those who refused to try the tools when Coinbase bought enterprise licenses for GitHub Copilot and Cursor got promptly fired, CEO Brian Armstrong said this week on John Collison’s podcast “Cheeky Pint.” (Collison is the co-founder and president of the payments company Stripe.)After getting licenses to cover every engineer, some at the cryptocurrency exchange warned Armstrong that adoption would be slow, predicting it would take months to get even half the engineers using AI. Armstrong was shocked at the thought. “I went rogue,” he said, and posted a mandate in the company’s main engineering Slack channel. “I said, ‘AI is important. We need you to all learn it and at least onboard. You don’t have to use it every day yet until we do some training, but at least onboard by the end of the week. And if not, I’m hosting a meeting on Saturday with everybody who hasn’t done it and I’d like to meet with you to understand why.’” At the meeting, some people had reasonable explanations for not getting their AI assistant accounts set up during the week, like being on vacation, Armstrong said.“I jumped on this call on Saturday and there were a couple people that had not done it. Some of them had a good reason, because they were just getting back from some trip or something, and some of them didn’t [have a good reason]. And they got fired.”Armstrong admits that it was a “heavy-handed approach” and there were people in the company who “didn’t like it.”While it doesn’t sound like very many people were fired, Armstrong said it sent a clear message that AI is not optional. Still, everything about that story is wild: that there were engineers who wouldn’t spend a few minutes of their week signing up for and testing the AI assistant — the most hyped tech for coders ever — and that Armstrong was willing to fire them over it.Coinbase did not respond to a request for comment.Since then, Armstrong has leaned further into the training. He said the company hosts monthly meetings where teams who have mastered creative ways to use AI share what they have learned.Interestingly, Collison, who has been programming since childhood, questioned how much companies should be relying on AI-generated code.“It’s clear that it is very helpful to have AI helping you write code. It’s not clear how you run an AI-coded code base,” he commented.  Armstrong replied, “I agree.”Indeed, as TechCrunch previously reported, a former OpenAI engineer described that company’s central code repository as “a bit of a dumping ground.” The engineer said management had begun dedicating engineering resources to improve the situation.We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Pointers had bits, those bits formed memory addresses, and as often as not we didn't even need to worry about these addresses being translated.  But life is more complicated now.  On the other hand, computing life is also much bigger, faster, more reliable, and (usually) more productive, so be extremely careful what you wish for from back in the Good Old Days!These days, pointers have provenance as well as addresses, and this has consequences.  The C++ Standard  (recent draft) states that when an object's storage duration ends, any pointers to that object become invalid.  For its part, the C Standard states that when an object's storage duration ends, any pointers to that object become indeterminate.  In both standards, the wording is more precise, but this will serve for our purposes.For the remainder of this document, we will follow C++ and say “invalid”, which is shorter than “indeterminate”.  We will balance this out by using C-language example code.  Those preferring C++ will be happy to hear that this is the language that I use in my upcoming CPPCON presentation.Neither standard places any constraints on what a compiler can do with an invalid pointer value, even if all you are doing is loading or storing that value.Those of us who cut our teeth on assembly language might quite reasonably ask why anyone would even think to make pointers so invalid that you cannot even load or store them.  Let's start by looking at pointer comparisons using this code fragment:p = kmalloc(...);
might_kfree(p);         // Pointer might become invalid (AKA "zapped")
q = kmalloc(...);       // Assume that the addresses of p and q are equal.
if (p == q)             // Compiler can optimize as "if (false)"!!!
    do_something();
Both  and  contain addresses, but the compiler also keeps track of the fact that their values were obtained from different invocations of .  This information forms part of each pointer's provenance.  This means that  and  have different provenance, which in turn means that the compiler does not need to generate any code for the  comparison.  The two pointers' provenance differs, so the result cannot be anything other than .And this is one motivation for pointer provenance and invalidity:  The results of operations on invalid pointers are not guaranteed, which provides additional opportunities for optimization.  This example perhaps seems a bit silly, but modern compilers can use pointer provenance and invalidity to carry out serious points-to and aliasing analysis.Yes, you can have hardware provenance.  Examples include ARM MTE, the CHERI research prototype (which last I checked had issues with C++'s requirement that pointers are trivially copiable), and the venerable IBM System i.  Conventional systems provide pointer provenance of a sort via their page tables, which is used by a variety of memory-allocation-use debuggers, for but one example, the efence library.  The pointer-provenance features of ARM MTE and IBM System i are not problematic, but last I checked, the jury was still out on CHERI.Of course, using invalid (AKA “dangling”) pointers is known to be a bad idea.  So why are we even talking about it???Why Would Anyone Use Invalid/Dangling Pointers?Please allow me to introduce you to the famous and frequently re-invented LIFO Push algorithm.  You can find this in many places, but let's focus on the Linux kernel's  and  functions.  The former atomically pushes a list of elements on a linked-list stack, and the latter just as atomically removes the entire contents of the stack:static inline bool llist_add_batch(struct llist_node *new_first,
                                   struct llist_node *new_last,
                                   struct llist_head *head)
{
    struct llist_node *first = READ_ONCE(head->first);

    do {
        new_last->next = first;
    } while (!try_cmpxchg(&head->first, &first, new_first));

    return !first;
}

static inline struct llist_node *llist_del_all(struct llist_head *head)
{
    return xchg(&head->first, NULL);
}
As lockless concurrent algorithms go, this one is pretty straightforward.  The  function reads the list header, fills in the  pointer, then does a compare-and-exchange operation to point the list header at the new first element.  The  function is even simpler, doing a single atomic exchange operation to  out the list header and returning the elements that were previously on the list.  This algorithm also has excellent forward-progress properties: the  function is lock-free and the  function is wait-free.In assembly language, or with a simple compiler, not much.  But to see the pointer-provenance issue with more heavily optimized languages, consider the following sequence of events:CPU 0 allocates an  B and passes it via both the  and  parameters of .CPU 0 picks up the  pointer and places it in the  local variable, then assigns it to .  This  pointer now references  A.CPU 1 invokes , which returns a list containing  A.  The caller of  processes A and passes it to .CPU 0's  pointer is now invalid due to  A having been freed.  But CPU 0 does not know this.CPU 1 allocates an  C that happens to have the same address as the old  A.  It passes C  via both the  and  parameters of , which runs to completion.  The  pointer now points to  C, which happens to have the same address as the now storage-duration-ended  A.CPU 0 finally gets around to executing its , which given typical C compilers will succeed.  The  now contains an  B that contains an invalid pointer to dead  A, but whose pointer address happens to reference the shiny new  C.  (We term this invalid pointer a “zombie pointer” because it has in some assembly-language sense come back from the dead.)Some CPU invokes  and gets back an  containing an invalid pointer.One could argue that the Linux-kernel implementation of LIFO Push is simply buggy and should be fixed.  Except that there is no reasonable way to fix it.  Which of course raises the question...What Are Unreasonable Fixes?We can protect pointers from invalidity by storing them as integers, but:Suppose someone has an element that they are passing to a library function.  They should not be required to convert all their  pointers to integer just because the library's developers decide to switch to the LIFO Push algorithm for some obscure internal operation.In addition, switching to integer defeats type-checking, because integers are integers no matter what type of pointer they came from.We could restore some type-checking capability by wrapping the integer into a differently named struct for each pointer type.  Except that this requires a struct with some particular name to be treated as compatible with pointers of some type corresponding to that name, a notion that current do not support.In C++, we could use template metaprogramming to wrap an integer into a class that converts automatically to and from compatibly typed pointers.  But there would then be windows of time in which there was a real pointer, and at that time there would still be the possibility of pointer invalidity.All of the above hack-arounds put additional obstacles in the way of developers of concurrent software.In environments such as the Linux kernel that provides their own memory allocators, we can hide them from the compiler.  But this is not free, in fact, the patch that exposed the Linux-kernel's memory allocators to the compiler resulted in a small but significant improvement.However, it is fair to ask...Why Do We Care About Strange New Algorithms???Let's take a look at the history, courtesy of Maged Michael's diligent software archaeology.In 1986, R. K. Treiber presented an assembly language implementation of the LIFO Push algorithm in technical report RJ 5118 entitled “Systems Programming: Coping with Parallelism” while at the IBM Almaden Research Center.US Patent 3,886,525 was filed in June 1973, just a few months before I wrote my first line of code, and contains a prior-art reference to the LIFO Push algorithm (again with pop() instead of popall()) as follows: “Conditional swapping of a single address is sufficient to program a last-in, first-out single-user-at-a-time sequencing mechanism.”  (If you were to ask a patent attorney, you would likely be told that this 50-year-old patent has long since expired.  Which should be no surprise, given that it is even older than Dennis Ritchie's setuid Patent 4,135,240.)All three of these references describe LIFO push as if it was straightforward and well known.So we don’t know who first invented LIFO Push or when they invented it, but it was well known in 1973.  Which is well over a decade before C was first standardized, more than two decades before C++ was first standardized, and even longer before work was started on Rust.And its combination of (relative) simplicity and excellent forward-progress properties just might be why this algorithm was anonymously invented so long ago and why it is so persistently and repeatedly reinvented.  This frequent reinvention puts paid to any notion that LIFO Push is strange.So sorry, but LIFO Push is neither new nor strange.The lifetime-end pointer-zap story is not yet over, but we are currently pushing for the changes in four working papers.Nondeterministic Pointer ProvenanceP2434R4 (“Nondeterministic pointer provenance”) is the basis for the other three papers.  It asks that when converting a pointer to an integer and back, the implementation must choose a qualifying pointed-to object (if there is one) whose storage duration began before or concurrently with the conversion back to a pointer.  In particular, the implementation is free to ignore a qualifying pointed-to object when the conversion to pointer happens before the beginning of that object’s storage duration.The “qualifying” qualifier includes compatible type, as well as sufficiently early and long storage duration.But why restrict the qualifying pointed-to object's storage duration to begin before or concurrently with the conversion back to a pointer?An instructive example by Hans Boehm may be found in P2434R4, which shows that reasonable (and more important, very heavily used) optimizations would be invalidated by this approach.  Several examples that manage to be even more sobering may be found in David Goldblatt's P3292R0 (“Provenance and Concurrency”).Pointer Lifetime-End Zap Proposed Solutions: Atomics and VolatileP2414R10 (“Pointer lifetime-end zap proposed solutions: Atomics and volatile”) is motivated by the observation that atomic pointers are subject to update at any time by any thread, which means that the compiler cannot reasonably do much in the way of optimization.  This paper therefore asks (1) that atomic operations be redefined to yield and to store prospective pointers values and (2) that operations on volatile pointers be defined to yield and to store prospective pointer values.  The effect is as if atomic pointers were stored internally as integers. This includes the “old” pointer passed by reference to compare_exchange().This helps, but is not a full solution because atomic pointers are converted to non-atomic pointers prior to use, at which point they are subject to lifetime-end pointer zap.  And the standard does not even guarantee that a zapped pointer can even be loaded, stored, passed to a function, or returned from a function.  Which brings us to the next paper.Pointer Lifetime-End Zap Proposed Solutions: Tighten IDB for Invalid PointersP3347R3 (“Pointer lifetime-end zap proposed solutions: Tighten IDB for invalid pointers”) therefore asks that all non-comparison non-arithmetic non-dereference computations involving pointers, specifically including normal loads and stores, are fully defined even if the pointers are invalid.  This permits invalid pointers to be loaded, stored, passed as arguments, and returned.  Fully defining comparisons would rule out optimizations, and fully defining arithmetic would be complex and thus far unneeded.If these first three papers are accepted into the standard, the C++ implementation of LIFO Push show above becomes valid code.  This is important because this algorithm has been re-invented many times over the past half century, and is often open coded.  This makes it very hard to construct tools that find LIFO Push implementations in existing code.P3790R1: Pointer Lifetime-End Zap Proposed Solutions: Bag-of-Bits Pointer ClassP3790R1 (“Pointer lifetime-end zap proposed solutions: Bag-of-bits pointer class”) asks that (1) the addition to the C++ standard library of the function launder_bag_of_bits_ptr() that takes a pointer argument and returns a prospective pointer value corresponding to its argument; and (2) the addition to the C++ standard library of the class template  that is a pointer-like type that is still usable after the pointed-to object’s lifetime has ended.  Of course, such a pointer still cannot be dereferenced unless there is a live object at that pointer's address.  Furthermore, some systems, such as ARMv9 with memory tagging extensions (MTE) enabled have provenance as well as address bits in the pointer, and on such systems dereferencing will fail unless the pointer's provenance bits happen to match those of the pointed-to object.This function and template class is nevertheless quite useful for maintaining hash maps keyed by pointers after the pointed-to object's lifetime has ended.Unlike LIFO Push, source-code changes are required for these use cases.  This is unfortunate, but we have thus far been unable to come up with a same-source-code approach.Those who have participated in standards work (or even open-source work) will understand that the names launder_bag_of_bits_ptr() and  are still subject to bikeshedding.A Happen Lifetime-End Pointer Zap Ending?It is still too early to say for certain, but thus far these proposals are making much better progress than did their predecessors.  So who knows?  Perhaps C++29 will address lifetime-end pointer zap.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GPUI Hello World Tutorial - From Core Concepts to Hello World | 0xshadow&apos;s Blog</title><link>https://blog.0xshadow.dev/posts/learning-gpui/gpui-hello-world-tutorial/</link><author>/u/lazyhawk20</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 04:11:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post, we are going to learn about GPUI - an open source UI framework developed by the Zed Industries team to build interfaces by utilizing our computer’s GPU. We are going to learn the basics of GPUI by building a hello world app.Basic HTML, CSS and JS knowledgeGPUI is a hybrid immediate and retained mode, GPU-accelerated UI framework for Rust created by the makers of Zed editor. Before we dive into code, let me explain what these terms mean in simple language. means GPUI uses our computer’s graphics card to render to interface unlike traditional CPU-based rendering. This makes it extremely fast.Hybrid immediate and retained mode refers to how GPUI manages the user interface: means the UI is redrawn from scratch every frame. means the framework remembers the UI structure and only updates what changes, which is more efficient. mean GPUI uses both approaches.Before jumping into coding, lets understand why the Zed team created GPUI? Why the existing solutions aren’t good enough for them?When Zed team decided to build their own code editor, they realized that existing UI frameworks couldn’t deliver the performance they need. Hence, they decided to build their own UI framework.
The problem with traditional desktop UI frameworks is that they primarily use CPU for rendering. The CPU processes instructions sequentially. This becomes a bottleneck when you have a complex interface with many elements. Every button, text field, menu and visual element must be processed in sequence.To fix this issue, they decided to use GPU of the computer, which can process thousands of operations in parallel. Your graphics card contains hundreads and thousands or cores that can work simultaneously. This parallel processing has been used in gaming for decades, but most desktop apps don’t take advantage of it.Now that we know why GPUI exists, lets now see how it actually works. After understanding its core concepts, we can start building our app as we will already have the understanding of its essential concepts.The Application Lifecycle and AppContextWhen we run a GPUI app, the framework needs to take care of a lot of things that are happening simultaneously. Our app might have multiple windows open, user might be clicking buttons, typing text or resizing windows.The  object is kind of the coordinator of all this activity. When we run , we are telling GPUI to “start managing the app and keep running until the user closes the app”.The (often shortened to  in code) is what we will use to communicate with the  object. Every time we want to create a window, handle an event or update the display, we need to do it through the .Views and The Render TraitIn GPUI, everything we see on screen is organized into . A view is a Rust struct that represents a logical piece of our application’s interface. Think of a view as a self-contained component that manages both its own data and knows how to present that data visually.Here’s what makes GPUI fundamentally different from desktop frameworks like Electron, Tauri, or traditional native frameworks: GPUI uses a declarative rendering approach rather than an imperative one. In imperative frameworks, we create interface objects once and then manually update their properties when things change. We might write code like button.setText("New Label") or window.setBackgroundColor(red) to modify existing interface elements.GPUI works differently. It doesn’t store permanent interface objects that we modify. Instead, GPUI asks our views to completely recreate their visual description every single time the screen needs to be redrawn. This happens through the  trait, which every displayable struct must implement.The  trait has exactly one method: . This method takes the current state of our view and returns a fresh description of what should appear on screen. GPUI calls this method whenever it needs to redraw our view, which could be 60 times per second or more. Our job is to look at our view’s current data and describe what the interface should look like based on that data.This approach might seem inefficient at first glance, but it’s actually what enables GPUI’s exceptional performance. Since GPUI gets a complete description of our interface every frame, it can compare the new description with the previous one and update only the parts that actually changed. This is similar to how React’s virtual DOM works, but optimized for GPU rendering instead of web browsers.When our  method runs, it creates and returns elements. Elements are temporary objects that describe visual components. They specify things like “there should be a rectangle here with this color and size” or “there should be text here with this font and content.” Elements are not the actual visual components themselves, but rather instructions for creating those components.GPUI provides built-in element types that cover most interface needs. The  element creates a container that can hold other elements, similar to HTML div tags but designed for desktop applications. The  element creates an interactive button that can respond to clicks. The  element displays styled text content. Each element type has methods we can chain together to configure its appearance and behavior.The power of GPUI’s element system comes from composition. We build complex interfaces by nesting simple elements inside other elements. A  can contain multiple child elements, and each of those children can have their own children, creating a hierarchical tree structure. This tree represents the logical structure of our interface.When we call methods like , , or  on elements, we’re not modifying existing objects. Instead, we’re creating new element descriptions that include those properties. GPUI uses a builder pattern where each method call returns a new element with the additional configuration applied.Now, that we understood a little bit of theory, let’s start building our first simple hello world app in GPUI.Installing Rust Nightly for Our ProjectTo use GPUI we need to have the nightly version of Rust because it is using some experimental features. To install the nightly tool, run the following command:This will download and install the latest nightly version of Rust.Let’s start by creating a new rust project using cargo. Open the terminal and go to the directory where you want the project to be created. Now, run the following command:After running this command, you can see that you have a standard rust project that prints Hello World in console but we want to create a GPUI app and print the Hello World text in that app.Now, we need to enable the nightly version of Rust specifically for this project and not for all Rust projects. To do this, create a file called  in our project root directory.This tells Cargo to automatically use nightly Rust whenever we work in this project directory, while keeping our global Rust installation on stable.It’s time to configure our  file to work with the nightly edition and GPUI.Configuring Cargo for 2024 Edition and GPUILet’s update our  file.Here, we changed the  from  to  and added the GPUI dependency.Writing Our Hello World CodeI’m putting the entire  code here and after that I’ll explain everything one by one.Ok, it seems a lot of code for Hello World let’s unpack everything one by one.This import statement gets everything that we need from GPUI. Let’s understand what we are importing from GPUI: - The context type we receive in our main application closure for setting up windows and global app state - The main application object that manages our entire GPUI app lifecycle - A type that represents the position and size of windows on screen - The context object we receive in our render method, giving us access to GPUI’s systems for this specific view - GPUI’s optimized string type that allows efficient sharing of text data without unnecessary copying - Represents a window and provides access to window-specific properties and methodsWindowBounds, WindowOptions - Configuration types for specifying how our window should be created and positioned - The function that creates div elements, our main building block for layouts - Brings in commonly used traits like  and utility functions - Helper functions for creating measurements (pixels), colors, and size specificationsDefining Our View with StateOur view struct contains the actual text data. The  field stores the text that we want to show or display in the app.Now, you might be wondering why use  instead of ?
The reason is GPUI optimizes for sharing the text between different parts of the app. The  can be cloned very efficiently without copying the actual text data and multiple parts of our app can reference the same text without memory overhead.Implementing the Render TraitNow, let’s understand the signature of the  method: - Mutable access to our view, allowing us to modify the view’s state during rendering if needed. Even though we don’t modify anything in this example, GPUI requires this flexibility. - Access to the window this view is being rendered in. We could use this to query window properties like current size, position, or screen DPI. The underscore indicates we’re not using it in this simple example. - The context object that provides access to GPUI’s systems. Through this context, we could handle user input, set up timers, or create child views. The  parameter means this context is specifically typed for our  view.Building Our Element TreeNow let’s understand each method call in our element construction:This creates our root  element - the foundation container for everything else in our view. This is similar to how we use div for containers in HTML.This enables flexbox layout on our div. Flexbox provides powerful, automatic layout capabilities that adjust to different content sizes and window dimensions. This is why I asked you to have basic knowledge on CSS. If you don’t know flexbox concept then please quickly read about it and then continue reading this tutorial.This sets the flex direction to column, meaning any child elements would stack vertically rather than horizontally. Even though we only have one child, this establishes the layout direction.This sets the background color to a dark blue-gray. The  function takes a hexadecimal color value and converts it to GPUI’s internal color representation.This sets both width and height to exactly 500 pixels. The  function creates a pixel-based measurement. This gives us a fixed-size container regardless of window size.This centers content along the main axis. Since we used , the main axis runs vertically, so this centers our content vertically within the 500-pixel height.This centers content along the cross axis. With column direction, the cross axis runs horizontally, so this centers our content horizontally within the 500-pixel width.This sets the text size to extra large. GPUI provides a typography scale with predefined sizes for consistent text styling across our application.This sets the text color to light gray, providing good contrast against our dark background.This adds our text content as a child element. We use  to create a dynamic string that includes our view’s  field. The  accesses the SharedString from our view’s state.Application Startup and Configuration - Creates and initializes a new GPUI application, setting up the rendering engine, event system, and platform integration..run(|cx: &mut App| { ... }) - Starts the application main loop and executes our setup closure. The  parameter gives us an  context for configuring our application’s initial state.Understanding Closures in RustThe  syntax is a  in Rust, which is similar to anonymous functions or lambda functions in other languages. Let’s break this down:The  symbols define a closure. Think of closures as functions that we define inline without giving them a name.The closure is like defining and using the function all in one place.
GPUI’s  method needs to:Initialize all the graphics systemsSet up the main application loopLet us configure our initial windows and viewsStart processing events and rendering
The  method says: “I’ll handle all the complex setup, but when I’m ready, I’ll call your closure so you can tell me what windows and views you want.” is just a variable name (short for “context”) means “a mutable reference to an App object”The  object gives us access to GPUI’s application-level features like creating windowsThink of  as a control panel that GPUI hands us, saying “here, use this to set up your application.”Window Creation and PositioningThis calculates where our window should appear: creates window bounds that center the window on screen means use the primary monitor (we could specify a particular monitor) creates a 500x500 pixel size specification provides information about the current screen configurationCreates a window with specific options: configures window propertieswindow_bounds: Some(WindowBounds::Windowed(bounds)) sets the window to normal windowed mode with our calculated position and size uses default values for other options like window title, decorations, etc.View Creation and InitializationWe actually have  nested in our code: - Sets up our application - Defines what goes in the window - Creates our view instanceEach closure handles a different level of setup: - “What windows should exist?” - “What should go in this specific window?” - “How should this view be initialized?”The window creation closure does two things:Takes a window handle (ignored with ) and a window-specific contextUses  to create and register our view with GPUIThe inner closure creates our initial  instance with “GPUI World” as the text converts the string literal into a You’ll notice some closures use  as a parameter name:The  means “I receive a parameter here, but I don’t need to use it.” It’s Rust’s way of saying “ignore this parameter” without getting compiler warnings.When we run this application: initializes all GPUI systems starts the main application loop and calls our setup closureWe calculate window bounds for a centered 500x500 windowWe create a window with those specificationsWe create a  view instance with initial textGPUI calls our view’s  method to get the element descriptionOur  method returns a 500x500 div with centered textGPUI renders this using the GPU and displays our windowThe application loop continues, ready for user interaction or updatesBuilding and Running Our ApplicationNow let’s see our hello world app in action. In your terminal, make sure you’re in the project directory and run:The first time you run this command, it will take several minutes to complete. Cargo needs to download the Zed repository, compile GPUI and all its dependencies, and then compile our application. We’ll see a lot of output as Cargo builds everything.Don’t worry if this seems slow - this lengthy compilation only happens the first time. Subsequent runs will be much faster because Cargo caches the compiled dependencies.When the compilation finishes and our application starts, we should see a 500x500 pixel window appear with our “Hello, GPUI World!” message centered on a dark background. The text should be large and clearly visible in light gray against the dark blue-gray background. Something like this:
Try interacting with the window - we can move it around, resize it, minimize it, and close it. Even though we haven’t written any code to handle these interactions, GPUI provides them automatically because they’re standard window operations.This concludes learning the basics of GPUI and displaying hello world in the screen. I hope you’ve learned something from this post and in the next post we are going to learn about handling user inputs, managing state changes, making our app respond to user actions and understanding event handling in GPUI. Learning these things before implementing the todo app would help us cover a lot of concepts in an isolated way making them simpler to understand. See you soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kremlin says no plans for Putin – Zelenskyy meeting | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-_9emDVl_U</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/t-_9emDVl_U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 04:01:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We have reported every day on efforts largely by Europe, some by the US, to put together security guarantees for Ukraine once the war against Russia is history.

I have a 3 master 4 node K3S cluster installed on top of my Hyper-V S2D cluster in my lab and currently I'm just using Longhorn + each node having a 500gb vhd attached to serve as storage but as I'm using this to learn kube I wanted to try to work on building more scalable storage. To that end I'm trying to figure out how to get any form of basic networked storage for my K3S cluster. In doing research I'm finding NFS is much to slow to use in prod so I'm trying to see if there's a way to set up ISCSI LUNs attached to the cluster / workers but I'm not seeing a clear path to even get startedI initially pulled out an old Dell SAN (A Compellent Scv2020) that I'm trying to get running but that right now is out of band due to it missing it's SCOS but I do know if the person who I found has an iso for SCOS I could get this running as ISCSI storage so I took 2 R610s I had laying around and made a basic Starwind vSAN but I cannot for the life of me figure out HOW to expose ANY LUNs to the k3s cluster. My end goal is to have something to host storage that's both more scalable than longhorn and vhds that also can be backed up by Veeam Kasten ideally as I'm in big part also trying to get dr testing with Kasten done as part of this config as I determine how to properly handle backups for some on prem kube clusters I'm responsible for in my new roles that we by compliance couldn't use cloud storage forI see democratic-csi mentioned a lot but that appears to be orchestration of LUNs or something through your vendors interface that I cannot find on Starwind and that I don't SEE an EOL SAN like the scv2020 having in any of my searches. I see I see CEPH mentioned but that looks like it's going to similarly operate with local storage like longhorn or requires 3 nodes to get started and the hosts I have to even perform that drastically lack the bay space a full SAN does (Let alone electrical issues I'm starting to run into with my lab but thats beyong this LOL) Likewise I see democratic could work with TrueNAS scale but that also requires 3 nodes and again will have less overall storage. I was debating spinning a Garage node for this and running s3 locally but I'm reading if I want to do ANYTHING with database or heavy write operations is doomed with this method and nfs storage similarly have such issues (Supposedly) Finally I've been through a LITANY of various csi github pages but nearly all of them seem either dead or lacking documentation on how they workMy ideal would just be connecting a LUN into the cluster in a way I can provision to it directly so I can use the SAN but my understanding is I can't exactly like, create a shared VHDX in Hyper-v and add that to local storage or longhorn or something without basically making the whole cluster either extremely manual or extremely unstable correct?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google Says It Dropped the Energy Cost of AI Queries By 33x In One Year</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/2118234/google-says-it-dropped-the-energy-cost-of-ai-queries-by-33x-in-one-year?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 03:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has released (PDF) a new analysis of its AI's environmental impact, showing that it has cut the energy use of AI text queries by a factor of 33 over the past year. Each prompt now consumes about 0.24 watt-hours -- the equivalent of watching nine seconds of TV. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from an Ars Technica article: "We estimate the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses 0.24 watt-hours of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters (or about five drops) of water," they conclude. To put that in context, they estimate that the energy use is similar to about nine seconds of TV viewing. The bad news is that the volume of requests is undoubtedly very high. The company has chosen to execute an AI operation with every single search request, a compute demand that simply didn't exist a couple of years ago. So, while the individual impact is small, the cumulative cost is likely to be considerable.
 
The good news? Just a year ago, it would have been far, far worse. Some of this is just down to circumstances. With the boom in solar power in the US and elsewhere, it has gotten easier for Google to arrange for renewable power. As a result, the carbon emissions per unit of energy consumed saw a 1.4x reduction over the past year. But the biggest wins have been on the software side, where different approaches have led to a 33x reduction in energy consumed per prompt.
 
The Google team describes a number of optimizations the company has made that contribute to this. One is an approach termed Mixture-of-Experts, which involves figuring out how to only activate the portion of an AI model needed to handle specific requests, which can drop computational needs by a factor of 10 to 100. They've developed a number of compact versions of their main model, which also reduce the computational load. Data center management also plays a role, as the company can make sure that any active hardware is fully utilized, while allowing the rest to stay in a low-power state.
 
The other thing is that Google designs its own custom AI accelerators, and it architects the software that runs on them, allowing it to optimize both sides of the hardware/software divide to operate well with each other. That's especially critical given that activity on the AI accelerators accounts for over half of the total energy use of a query. Google also has lots of experience running efficient data centers that carries over to the experience with AI. The result of all this is that it estimates that the energy consumption of a typical text query has gone down by 33x in the last year alone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Measuring the environmental impact of AI inference</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/google-says-it-dropped-the-energy-cost-of-ai-queries-by-33x-in-one-year/</link><author>ksec</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 03:22:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is a famine?

"If necessary, we will seek appropriate relief in US federal court to confirm these principles."They said authorities in the US had been "briefed" on their response to Ofcom's investigation.The statement concludes by calling on the Trump administration to invoke all diplomatic and legal levers to protect American businesses from "extraterritorial censorship mandates".Ofcom has previously said the Online Safety Act only requires services to take action to protect users based in the UK.Some American politicians - particularly the Trump administration, its allies and officials - have pushed back against what they regard as overreach in the regulation of US tech firms by the UK and EU. A perceived impact of the Online Safety Act on free speech has been a particular concern, but other laws have also been the source of disagreement.On 19 August, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the UK had withdrawn its controversial demand for a "backdoor" in an Apple data protection system - saying she worked with the President and Vice President to get the UK to abandon its plan.Two days later, US Federal Trade Commission chairman Andrew Ferguson warned big tech firms they could be violating US law if they weakened privacy and data security requirements by complying with international laws such as the Online Safety Act."Foreign governments seeking to limit free expression or weaken data security in the United States might count on the fact that companies have an incentive to simplify their operations and legal compliance measures by applying uniform policies across jurisdictions," he said.If 4chan does successfully fight the fine in the US courts, Ofcom may have other options."Enforcing against an offshore provider is tricky," Emma Drake, partner of online safety and privacy at law firm Bird and Bird, told the BBC. "Ofcom can instead ask a court to order other services to disrupt a provider's UK business, such as requiring a service's removal from search results or blocking of UK payments."If Ofcom doesn't think this will be enough to prevent significant harm, it can even ask that ISPs be ordered to block UK access."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UN aid chief: Gaza famine &apos;preventable&apos;, blames Israel&apos;s &apos;systematic obstruction&apos; of aid | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6z2gkk-RXuI</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6z2gkk-RXuI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 03:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A UN-backed global hunger monitor has declared a famine in Gaza City, warning that half-a-million people are living in catastrophic conditions.

This marks the first time the Ukrainian military has destroyed a so-called "mother drone" carrying other UAVs, the brigade claimed. "Anti-aircraft gunners from the 118th Separate Mechanized Brigade destroyed an enemy Orlan drone carrying two FPV drones under its wings," the unit said in a Facebook post. "Prior to this, the pilots of the pursuit platoon had already shot down dozens of enemy reconnaissance drones — Orlan, Zala, and Supercam — but this was the first time they had managed to destroy a mother drone."The Orlan is a Russian-developed reconnaissance drone widely used by Russia in Ukraine. Feared by Ukrainian soldiers, it often serves to target Russian artillery attacks. It can travel 600 kilometers and climb to an altitude of 5,000 meters.Innovations in drone warfare are a key component of Ukraine's defense strategy against Russia. Kyiv is reportedly developing its own version of a drone-carrier in partnership with the German defense company Quantum Systems. The Sparta is designed to carry two FPV drones with a combat radius of 200 km (124 miles.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>French peacekeepers uncover Hezbollah&apos;s remnants in Lebanon</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSbxFrKZsLY</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TSbxFrKZsLY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 02:10:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[French peacekeepers uncover Hezbollah's remnants in southern Lebanon as UNIFIL faces a contentious vote on renewing its mandate at the UN Security Council in the coming days.

This includes several new web platform features:Notable changes for Servo library consumers:Like many browsers, Servo has two kinds of zoom:  affects the size of the viewport, while  does not (@shubhamg13, #38194).
 now correctly triggers reflow (@mrobinson, #38166), and  is now reset to the viewport meta config when navigating (@shubhamg13, #37315). is now isolated between webviews, and copied to new webviews with the same  (@janvarga, #37803). now has a  and , so you can now  on Linux (@MichaelMcDonnell, #38038).
We’ve made it more ergonomic too, fixing both the sluggish  and pixel-perfect trackpad scrolling and the too fast  (@yezhizhen, #37982). is key to programmable graphics on the web, with Servo supporting WebGPU, WebGL, and 2D canvas contexts.
But the general-purpose 2D graphics routines that power Servo’s 2D canvases are potentially useful for a lot more than <canvas>:  is bread and butter for Servo, but  is only minimally supported right now, and  is not yet implemented at all.Those features have one thing in common: they require things that WebRender can’t yet do.
 does one thing and does it well: rasterise the layouts of the web, really fast, by using the GPU as much as possible.
Font rendering and SVG rendering both involve rasterising arbitrary paths, which currently has to be done outside WebRender, and PDF output is out of scope entirely.The more code we can share between these tasks, the better we can make that code, and the smaller we can make Servo’s binary sizes (#38022).
We’ve started by moving 2D-<canvas>-specific state out of the  crate (@sagudev, #38098, #38114, #38164, #38214), which has in turn allowed us to modernise it with new backends based on Vello (@EnnuiL, @sagudev, #30636, #38345):a Vello GPU-based backend (@sagudev, #36821), currently slower than the default backend; to use it, build Servo with  and enable it with --pref dom_canvas_vello_enableda Vello CPU-based backend (@sagudev, #38282), already faster than the default backend; to use it, build Servo with  and enable it with --pref dom_canvas_vello_cpu_enabledMany recent Servo bugs have been related to our handling of , , and  (#36817, #37804, #37824, #37878, #37978, #38089, #38090, #38093, #38255).
Symptoms of these bugs include  (e.g. links that can’t be clicked),  to the end of the page, or  like disappearing browser UI or black bars.Windows rarely take up the whole screen, viewports rarely take up the whole window due to window decorations, and when different units come into play, like CSS  vs device pixels, a more systematic approach is needed.
We built  to solve these problems in a strongly typed way within Servo, but beyond the viewport, we need to convert between euclid types and the geometry types provided by the embedder, the toolkit, the platform, or WebDriver, which creates opportunities for errors.Servo is also on thanks.dev, and already  (−3 from June) that depend on Servo are sponsoring us there.
If you use Servo libraries like url, html5ever, selectors, or cssparser, signing up for thanks.dev could be a good way for you (or your employer) to give back to the community.As always, use of these funds will be decided transparently in the Technical Steering Committee.

Islam's Greatest Stories of Love
An extraordinary exploration of love's boundless power to heal, inspire, and transform. At the heart of the film is Ariella, a brilliant young Muslim scholar whose life is upended by the tragic loss of her father. Shattered but determined, she embarks on a bold journey to uncover answers to life's most profound questions: What is love? Can it endure across time and adversity? And how do we rebuild after losing it? Along the way, Ariella is captivated by five astonishing tales from the Islamic tradition — stories that redefine love's meaning.

She delves into an epic poem of star-crossed love as tragic as Romeo and Juliet and unravels the mysteries of the Taj Mahal. She discovers a largely unknown story about how family love shaped Malcolm X and finds empowerment in the remarkable partnership of the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija. Woven through these rich narratives is Ariella’s own quest to rediscover faith, hope, and the courage to love again. With breathtaking storytelling and universal resonance, Islam’s Greatest Stories of Love invites viewers on a journey as unforgettable as the stories it unveils, reminding us that love is not just an emotion; it is a force.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Codanna now supports Go!

TechCrunch reports: In a blog post published on Friday, the company explains that, as a small team, it doesn't have the resources to make the substantial technical changes this type of law would require, and it raised concerns about the law's broad scope and privacy implications. Mississippi's HB 1126 requires platforms to introduce age verification for all users before they can access social networks like Bluesky. On Thursday, U.S. Supreme Court justices decided to block an emergency appeal that would have prevented the law from going into effect as the legal challenges it faces played out in the courts. As a result, Bluesky had to decide what it would do about compliance.
 
Instead of requiring age verification before users could access age-restricted content, this law requires age verification of all users. That means Bluesky would have to verify every user's age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The company notes that the potential penalties for noncompliance are hefty, too -- up to $10,000 per user. Bluesky also stresses that the law goes beyond child safety, as intended, and would create "significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies." To comply, Bluesky would have to collect and store sensitive information from all its users, in addition to the detailed tracking of minors. This is different from how it's expected to comply with other age verification laws, like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), which only requires age checks for certain content and features.
 
Mississippi's law blocks anyone from using the site unless they provide their personal and sensitive information. The company notes that its decision only applies to the Bluesky app built on the AT Protocol. Other apps may approach the decision differently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Netbeans 27 Released</title><link>https://lists.apache.org/thread/py28oztx51vhk4f1js3q54vpx8pwzbb3</link><author>/u/BlueGoliath</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 00:19:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Computer fraud laws used to prosecute leaking air crash footage to CNN</title><link>https://www.techdirt.com/2025/08/22/investigators-used-terrible-computer-fraud-laws-to-ensure-people-were-punished-for-leaking-air-crash-footage-to-cnn/</link><author>BallsInIt</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 00:04:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[from the if-it-can-be-abused,-it-WILL-be-abused deptEarlier this year, an Army helicopter collided with a passenger plane over the Potomac River in Washington, DC. All sixty-seven people aboard both vehicles were killed. While the FAA focused its investigation on the failures that led to this mid-air collision, local investigators in Virginia were somehow far more concerned about identifying who had leaked footage of the collision to CNN. The subject matter of the leaked recordings was obviously of public interest. And while the government may have its own interest in controlling dissemination of recording of incidents that involve federal agencies and their oversight, it’s not the sort of government interest most courts consider to be worthy of violating the First Amendment.Fortunately, the government has options. For a very long time, the option federal law enforcement deployed most frequently in cases involving pretty much any sort of technology was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). This broadly written law not only allowed prosecutors to charge people with federal crimes for doing nothing more than interacting with services/servers/etc. in unexpected ways, but allowed companies to, essentially, shoot the messengers for reporting data breaches, unsecured servers, or sloppy user interfaces that could be exploited to display far more information than those running them intended.Here’s what Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority investigator Patrick Silsbee wrote in his report:“The video shows camera angles and views that can only be found on the Metropolitan Washington Airport’s Authority CCTV video,” Silsbee wrote in a January 31 report, noting the location of landmarks in the videos, including a boathouse near the airfield.The locations of the MWAA security cameras are redacted in the reports provided to The Intercept, ostensibly “to prevent the disclosure of law enforcement and security techniques and procedures not generally known outside the law enforcement community,” according to an accompanying letter from MWAA.That doesn’t mean much by itself, but Silsbee apparently figured out (thanks in part to CNN’s initial failure to redact some CCTV text that described the location of the camera) this footage must have been obtained by an MWAA employee working at the police dispatch center. CCTV footage from  the dispatch center was obtained, which allegedly showed these actions being taken by the suspected leaker:“Between the hours of 2256 and 0545, Mr. Mbengue can be seen on multiple occasions utilize [sic] his personal cell phone to record video and photograph these critical scenes,” Silsbee wrote.That would be MWAA dispatch employee Mohamed Mbengue, who has since pleaded “no contest” to charges stemming from Virginia’s ultra-vague “computer trespass” law. But it really takes a person with an overriding desire to shoot messengers to call cell phone recordings of screen images a “trespass.” The word is generally understood to describe unauthorized access to an area a person is not allowed to be in. Mbengue was at work and had full access to these recordings as a part of his job. That he recorded them and sent them to CNN doesn’t align with any rational definition of the word “trespass.” The dissemination of footage may be a violation of policy, but policy violations aren’t criminal charges — the sort of thing that can do permanent damage to a person’s life in ways that write-ups and even justified terminations simply can’t.That’s why discretion is key. But when discretion matters most, law enforcement tends to deliberately “err” on the side of whatever does the most damage to anyone it happens to be investigating. And it appears MWAA investigators are more than happy to throw criminal charges at people for, at most, violating agency policies. A second dispatcher (Jonathan Savoy) was caught doing the same thing (albeit without sharing the recordings with CNN) and faced similar charges until someone actually exercised a bit of discretion and declined to move forward with the case.On February 3, the MWAA announced both men’s arrests, writing in a press statement that Savoy had been arrested “following further police investigation.”In May, however, local prosecutors quietly dropped the charges against Savoy, through a filing called a “nolle prosequi,” according to the court docket.There’s absolutely nothing in the statute that actually covers the actions described here, which formed the basis for the bullshit criminal charges. It takes a ton of punitive imagination to turn “recording a CCTV monitor with a phone” into a criminal act. The only clause that could be even possibly be considered applicable requires investigators and prosecutors to engage in lot of extremely creative re-interpretations of the plain text of the law: Use a computer or computer network to make or cause to be made an unauthorized copy, in any form, including, but not limited to, any printed or electronic form of computer data, computer programs or computer software residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer networkA smartphone is a computer. A recording could be considered an “unauthorized copy.” To call the CCTV cameras and screens “computers/computer network” means ignoring the generally understood utility of this tech. Even if a network connects the cameras and a computer provides access to recordings, recording playback via phone while accessing footage the suspects had every right to access, calling this a violation of the law demonstrates investigators were out for revenge, rather than serving the commonly understood definition of the word “justice.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>😆 Dakota Johnson crashes co-stars&apos; interview for &apos;Splitsville&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VB3Wa7XbNGU</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VB3Wa7XbNGU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 00:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dakota Johnson pulled double duty as producer and star of the new relationship comedy "Splitsville," which follows two couples.

The $800 device, codenamed Hypernova, will be able to show simple visual content like texts and support AI assistant interactions. CNBC reports: Connect is a two-day conference for developers focused on virtual reality, AR and the metaverse. It was originally called Oculus Connect and obtained its current moniker after Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta in 2021. The glasses are internally codenamed Hypernova and will include a small digital display in the right lens of the device, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. The device is expected to cost about $800 and will be sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, the people said. CNBC reported in October that Meta was working with Luxottica on consumer glasses with a display. [...]
 
With Hypernova, Meta will finally be offering glasses with a display to consumers, but the company is setting low expectations for sales, some of the sources said. That's because the device requires more components than its voice-only predecessors, and will be slightly heavier and thicker, the people said. [...] Although Hypernova will feature a display, those visual features are expected to be limited, people familiar with the matter said. They said the color display will offer about a 20 degree field of view -- meaning it will appear in a small window in a fixed position -- and will be used primarily to relay simple bits of information, such as incoming text messages.
 
The Hypernova glasses will also come paired with a wristband that will use technology built by Meta's CTRL Labs, said people familiar with the matter. CTRL Labs, which Meta acquired in 2019, specializes in building neural technology that could allow users to control computing devices using gestures in their arms. [...] In addition to Hypernova and the wristband, Meta will also announce a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses with Luxottica at Connect, one person said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US Govt.

What happened to the close ties Donald Trump sought with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi? In recent weeks,T rump has slapped tariffs on Indian imports and in an effort to put pressure on Russia, he has threatened more tariffs on India if New Delhi keeps buying Russian oil.  To Trump’s annoyance, India has dismissed his claim that he personally ended the recent conflict with Pakistan.  
What happened to the Modi-Trump  bromance?  Was a clash between the two nationalist, populist leaders inevitable or will they still find a way out?  Does the US rebuff push India closer to Russia and China? Will the US renew its partnership with Pakistan? 

DW’s security podcast, Global Eyes, takes a look at how India’s policy of strategic autonomy is faring and whether in the current situation, Washington and New Delhi are on a collison course.  Chietigj Bajpaee of Chatham House’s South Asia Pacific Programme and Michael Kugelman of the Asia Pacific Foundation join our hosts.

The software behemoth gives some software vendors early bug disclosures under its Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), which typically delivers info two weeks before Patch Tuesday. MAPP participants sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in exchange get vulnerability details so that they can provide updated protections to customers more quickly.
 
According to Microsoft spokesperson David Cuddy, who spoke with Bloomberg about changes to the program, MAPP has begun limiting access to companies in "countries where they're required to report vulnerabilities to their governments," including China. Companies in these countries will no longer receive "proof of concept" exploit code, but instead will see "a more general written description" that Microsoft sends at the same time as patches, Cuddy told the news outlet. "A leak happened here somewhere," Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), told The Register in July. "And now you've got a zero-day exploit in the wild, and worse than that, you've got a zero-day exploit in the wild that bypasses the patch, which came out the next day."
 
Childs said the MAPP change "is a positive change, if a bit late. Anything Microsoft can do to help prevent leaks while still offering MAPP guidance is welcome."
 
"In the past, MAPP leaks were associated with companies out of China, so restricting information from flowing to these companies should help," Childs said. "The MAPP program remains a valuable resource for network defenders. Hopefully, Microsoft can squelch the leaks while sending out the needed information to companies that have proven their ability (and desire) to protect end users."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eswatini govt faces court challenge for accepting US deportees | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsAv05iibsA</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HsAv05iibsA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:58:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Human rights lawyers and activists have sued the Eswatini government for making a secretive deal with President Trump's administration to accept third-country deportees from the US, which they claim was unconstitutional.

The company announced Friday that it will be blocking all IP addresses within Mississippi for the foreseeable future in response to a recent US Supreme Court decision that allows the state to enforce strict age verification for social media platforms.According to Bluesky, Mississippi’s approach to verification “would fundamentally change” how users access the site. “We think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies,” the Bluesky team said in its statement.Bluesky did not respond to a request for comment.The company says that compliance with Mississippi’s law—which would require identifying and tracking all users under 18, in addition to asking every user for sensitive personal information to verify their age—is not possible with the team’s current resources and infrastructure. By not complying with the law, Bluesky could face fines of up to $10,000 per violation. It is the first major social media platform to take such drastic steps in response to the law.Age verification laws, which on the surface are intended to protect children from harmful content online, have already begun to broadly impact internet use in places around the world where they've been enacted. In the UK, users trying to access everything from pornography to social platforms must now submit to ID scans, credit card checks, age-estimation scans, and more to verify they’re over the age of 18. The state of Texas has a similar law the US Supreme Court upheld in June, despite concerns from critics over the erosion of free speech and access to information on the open internet.Whether these laws are effective at protecting children is unclear; the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) in the UK spiked just after its age verification law went into effect as users deployed the tech to spoof their location. On platforms like Discord, people discovered they could use video game characters to trick face scans. Furthermore, critics say that age verification laws intended to reduce harm to children can sometimes have the opposite effect by putting kids in greater danger of identity theft and privacy violations.WIRED has reached out to the sponsors of the original bill, Mississippi state representatives Jill Ford, Fabian Nelson, and Larry Byrd, and will update this story if they comment.“We believe effective child safety policies should be carefully tailored to address real harms, without creating huge obstacles for smaller providers and resulting in negative consequences for free expression,” Bluesky wrote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatLoopBackOff: Episode 68 (KANISTER)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dy_J3VmmOg</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-dy_J3VmmOg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 22:51:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join us LIVE as CNCF Ambassador Carlos Santana dives into Kanister, the open source framework for application-level data management on Kubernetes.

"We're a tech-friendly administration and we're always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward," [Mayor Eric Adams] said in a release. "New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century."
 
The news comes just two months after the company said it filed permits to test its cars in the city with a trained specialist behind the wheel.

This year will be remembered as the one in which that illusion came to an end. We had to accept U.S. tariffs, and we were pushed by our own ally to increase military spending – a decision perhaps necessary, but not in this form or at this pace.”Speaking at the 46th Meeting in Rimini, former Prime Minister Mario Draghi continued, “the EU played only a marginal role in peace negotiations over Ukraine. It was a mere spectator even as Iranian nuclear sites were bombed and the massacre in Gaza escalated.”According to Draghi, “Europe must move from being a spectator, or at best a supporting actor, to becoming a protagonist. That means reshaping its political organization, which is inseparable from its ability to meet economic and strategic goals. Economic reforms remain essential.”“Europe is the best opportunity we have for a future of peace and security. And as a democracy, it is you, it is us, the Europeans who set the priorities,” Draghi said.On fiscal policy, Draghi repeated his distinction between “good debt and bad debt,” but warned that in some areas national-level borrowing is no longer sufficient. He argued that only common European debt can finance large-scale projects in defense, energy, and emerging technologies.The former ECB president also pointed to a “brutal wake-up call” from Donald Trump, which he said reshaped relations with the U.S. “There is now a political, social, and psychological climate that gives hope for a new kind of political organization. We must learn to cooperate. Rigidity and passivity breed inaction – and that, as wève seen over the last 10-15 years, is Europès worst enemy.”“It is not surprising that skepticism toward Europe has reached new heights,” Draghi added. “But it is worth asking what lies at the heart of this skepticism. In my view, it is not directed at the values on which Europe was founded, but rather at the EU’s ability to defend those values. And that skepticism is partly justified: political structures are designed to address the challenges of their time, and when those challenges change, the structures themselves must change”.Vuoi pubblicare i contenuti di Italpress.com sul tuo sito web o vuoi promuovere la tua attività sul nostro sito e su quelli delle testate nostre partner?

From a report: The CO2 output of the nation's power sector -- its dominant source of emissions -- fell by 3% in the first half of the year, as growth in solar power alone matched the rise in electricity demand. The new analysis for Carbon Brief shows that record solar capacity additions are putting China's CO2 emissions on track to fall across 2025 as a whole. 

Other key findings include: 

The growth in clean power generation, some 270 terawatt hours (TWh) excluding hydro, significantly outpaced demand growth of 170TWh in the first half of the year.
Solar capacity additions set new records due to a rush before a June policy change, with 212 gigawatts (GW) added in the first half of the year.
This rush means solar is likely to set an annual record for growth in 2025, becoming China's single-largest source of clean power generation in the process.
Coal-power capacity could surge by as much as 80-100GW this year, potentially setting a new annual record, even as coal-fired electricity generation declines.
The use of coal to make synthetic fuels and chemicals is growing rapidly, climbing 20% in the first half of the year and helping add 3% to China's CO2 since 2020.
The coal-chemical industry is planning further expansion, which could add another 2% to China's CO2 by 2029, making the 2030 deadline for peaking harder to meet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says he knows little about search of John Bolton&apos;s home | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMYKagZ0Dzw</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YMYKagZ0Dzw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 21:37:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump said that he had limited knowledge of the FBI searching the home of his former aide John Bolton but called him a ‘lowlife’.

According to Preston Byrne, managing partner of law firm Byrne & Storm, Ofcom has provisionally decided to impose a 20,000-pound fine "with daily penalties thereafter" for as long as the site fails to comply with its request. "Ofcom's notices create no legal obligations in the United States," he told the BBC, adding he believed the regulator's investigation was part of an "illegal campaign of harassment" against US tech firms.
 
"4chan has broken no laws in the United States -- my client will not pay any penalty," Mr Byrne said. Ofcom began investigating 4chan over whether it was complying with its obligations under the UK's Online Safety Act. Then in August, it said it had issued 4chan with "a provisional notice of contravention" for failing to comply with two requests for information. Ofcom said its investigation would examine whether the message board was complying with the act, including requirements to protect its users from illegal content. "American businesses do not surrender their First Amendment rights because a foreign bureaucrat sends them an email," law firms Byrne & Storm and Coleman Law wrote. "Under settled principles of US law, American courts will not enforce foreign penal fines or censorship codes. If necessary, we will seek appropriate relief in US federal court to confirm these principles."
 
The statement calls on the Trump administration to intervene and protect American businesses from "extraterritorial censorship mandates."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Markets Rally On Powell’s Sept Cut Hint | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef4t_fwJ90c</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ef4t_fwJ90c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:32:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Vonnie Quinn, Caroline Hyde, Tim Stenovec and Norah Mulinda.

When workers don't have adequate protections from heat stress, their health and productivity suffer. 

It's a risk employers and lawmakers have to take more seriously if they want to keep workers safe and businesses prosperous, the agencies say. That means finding ways to adapt in a warming world, and paying close attention to groups that might be more vulnerable than others. 

[...] More than 2.4 billion people around the world -- 71 percent of the working population -- experience workplace heat stress, according to estimates from the ILO. Each year, 22.85 million occupational injuries and 18,970 fatalities are linked to excessive heat at work. The report also says that worker productivity falls 2-3 percent with every degree increase above 20 degrees Celsius in wet-bulb globe temperature, a measure that takes humidity and other environmental factors into account.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wall Street Gets Rally Signal From Powell | Bloomberg Businessweek Daily 8/22/2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmJtmcVp2Sg</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PmJtmcVp2Sg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 20:17:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On today's episode of Bloomberg Businessweek Daily, Tim Stenovec and Norah Mulinda discuss Jerome Powell's speech from Jackson Hole spurring huge movement in the market.

If people like the game I will make others that are continuations off of this, that are specific to distros but for now its base Linux.Quick background, I DO NOT KNOW LINUX, but we use it at work (Debian) and I need to learn it. This is why I made this game, every time I try to learn the commands ill forget them or say screw it, I will use the GUI. So, I thought if I had a game that focused on teaching me Linux, I could do it.... yeah, I know probably not going to happen, but still I set off to make it, and with the help of Google Gemini I have a solid Beta of the game, maybe Alpha/Beta, maybe Alpha. There is a lot I want to add after the instruction part of the game which is all I have now, so it is not complete just the 3 chapters that are below.Through QA'ing the game myself I have learned a ton about command line. But as anyone who has QA a game before, you eventually know what to put in to get to the next part, and this doesn’t give a good representation of whether or not the game is teaching well for people who just pick it up. So, I’m looking for any testers who know Linux, and anyone who doesn’t.I want people who know Linux, this way I can make sure all the commands work as they should, basically "look" the way they should in the simulated terminal, and to make sure I have all the commands that are available for basic Linux, and provide feedback where needed.I want people who don’t know Linux, this way I can get feedback on the way the game progresses, does it make sense, do you actually feel like you’re learning Linux while playing, is it confusing, what do you not like, etc.A little bit on what I have implemented so far,some simple non game elements are,Terminal themes, so I have Default theme (supposed to simulate the terminal from the movie Alien, its close but not 100%), Commodore 64, Dos, Linux, and Apple II+ (which was my first computer)A voice over on/off switch for the simulated AI, Aurora, it’s not a real AI or even a LLM it’s just simulated, all the commands and responses I have put in, and it is basic right now. But as the user you are being helped by a ship AI which is basically teaching you the Linux commands. And yeah, it was the closest voice I could get to simulate Mother in the movie Alien, and it sounds nothing like Mother.There is a beginner, intermediate, and advanced sections of the game, that teach you the following commands. Someone who knows Linux really good please let me know if you think anything is missing, but remember this is basic Linux so there is no apt-get etc. like in Debian, at least as far as I know.* `help` - Shows available commands.* `pwd` - Prints the current working directory.* `ls` - Lists files and directories.* `~` - A shortcut for the user's home directory.* `clear` - Clears the terminal screen.* `cat` - Displays the contents of a file.* `hint` - Provides a hint for the current objective.* `man` - Shows the manual page for a command.* `cd` - Changes the current directory.* `uptime` - Shows how long the system has been running.* `echo` - Displays text or writes it to a file.* `mkdir` - Creates a new directory.* `touch` - Creates a new, empty file.* `>` - A redirection operator to write output to a file.* `rm` - Removes (deletes) files.* `rmdir` - Removes (deletes) empty directories.* `mv` - Moves or renames files and directories.* `less` - Views the content of a file page by page.* `grep` - Searches for patterns within files.* `find` - Searches for files and directories.* `head` - Displays the beginning of a file.* `tail` - Displays the end of a file.* `wc` - Counts lines, words, and characters in a file.* `sort` - Sorts the lines of a file.* `|` - The "pipe" operator, used to send the output of one command to another.* `uniq` - Removes duplicate adjacent lines from a file.* `diff` - Compares two files and shows their differences.* `ln` - Creates links between files.* `uname` - Shows system information.* `whoami` - Shows the current user's username.* `groups` - Shows the groups a user belongs to.* `dmesg` - Shows kernel and driver messages.* `free` - Displays memory usage.* `df` - Displays disk space usage.* `du` - Shows the disk usage of files and directories.* `tree` - Displays a directory's contents in a tree-like format.* `file` - Determines a file's type.* `cmp` - Compares two files byte by byte.* `cut` - Extracts sections from lines of a file.* `tr` - Translates or deletes characters.* `<` - A redirection operator to use a file's content as input.* `tee` - Reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and files.* `locate` - Finds files by name quickly.* `chmod` - Changes the permissions of a file or directory.* `sudo` - Executes a command as the superuser (root).* `chown` - Changes the owner of a file or directory.* `umask` - Sets the default permissions for new files.* `split` - Splits a file into smaller pieces.* `paste` - Merges the lines of files.* `join` - Joins the lines of two files on a common field.* `tar` - Creates and extracts archive files.* `gzip` - Compresses or decompresses files.* `gunzip` - Decompresses `.gz` files.* `zip` - Creates a `.zip` archive.* `unzip` - Extracts files from a `.zip` archive.* `sed` - A stream editor for filtering and transforming text.* `awk` - A powerful pattern scanning and processing language.* `ping` - Tests network connectivity to a host.* `traceroute` - Traces the network path to a host.* `curl` - Transfers data from or to a server.* `ps` - Shows currently running processes.* `top` - Displays a dynamic, real-time view of processes.* `htop` - An interactive process viewer.* `netstat` - Shows network connections and statistics.* `kill` - Sends a signal to a process (e.g., to terminate it) by its ID.* `pkill` - Sends a signal to a process by its name.* `iostat` - Reports CPU and I/O statistics.* `vmstat` - Reports virtual memory statistics.* `sar` - Collects and reports system activity information.* `passwd` - Changes a user's password.* `groupadd` - Creates a new user group.* `useradd` - Creates a new user account.* `usermod` - Modifies an existing user account.* `userdel` - Deletes a user account.* `groupdel` - Deletes a user group.* `systemctl` - Manages system services.* `bg` - Sends a job to the background.* `fg` - Brings a job to the foreground.* `jobs` - Lists active jobs.* `mount` - Mounts a filesystem.* `umount` - Unmounts a filesystem.* `rsync` - Synchronizes files and directories between locations.* `dd` - Copies and converts files at a low level.* `lsof` - Lists open files.* `crontab` - Manages scheduled tasks (cron jobs).I’ve been working on the game for almost 4 months, and rewritten this game from scratch 3 times now, which sucks, but when I seem to make major changes I break things, and as I’m not a good programmer, I rely on AI (Google Gemini), and as anyone who has used any AI programmer you know sometimes it decides to just DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU HAVE CREATED BEYOND REPAIR! So, when you go through the Beginner section you will notice that all the commands you need to run are explained by the ship AI and it is 99% complete as far as I can tell. The intermediate and advanced sections so far have everything working, as in the commands to move on to the next section, but you need to talk to the ship AI for every new command you need to enter to complete the task. So, it works functionally as far as I last tested, but you need to ask Aurora what to do next all the time, which is a pain in the ass. But That will be fixed as soon as I know everything else in the Beginner section is working, as I don’t want to update everything to just have to redo it if I messed something up in the beginner part.Once the 3 parts are complete, I can then work on the, story part, which as of my planning will have 3 endings depending on how the player uses the Linux commands, and what they do in the game. The story part will be used as repetition on the commands from the previous 3 parts, this way it will hopefully burn the Linux commands into our heads, and we become Linux gods.So, what’s the premise of the game. You are a sole caretaker (except for the ship AI, Aurora) of a spaceship on a deep space mission. Something happened on the ship and the AI sent you to the Engineering Bay and converted all life support to that area before shutting down to conserver power as the power is draining as well. The ship is run on a Linux system, and you need to get it back up and running before the Life support and Power go to 0% and you die. But you don’t know Linux, so the localized version of the ship AI, Aurora, is there to talk you through how to fix the ship and bring the systems back up using just Linux commands from the one terminal that is working. once you get everything back up and running stably, then you need to go through and see what happened. From this point on is the story part of the game and will involve going into the ships servers to find out what happened and what else needs to be fixed, etc.The game is all web browser bases so far, when done I’ll be able to port it to windows, Linux, mobile, at least that is what Google Gemini told me. So, I can put all the files in a Zip, or upload to my google drive, or can I upload here? I don’t want to upload here yet unless I get permission, as I believe it was one of the rules, unless I read it wrong.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple May Use Google Gemini AI to Power Revamped Siri</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q_EPKg5_rA</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1q_EPKg5_rA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 19:48:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple is in early discussions about using Google Gemini to power a revamped version of its Siri voice assistant.

The project aims to make it easy to create tokens, check analytics, and give communities better visibility: all without needing complex coding or bridges.According to the team, right now, the world of crypto can feel confusing and scattered - people often have to jump between many different apps and tools just to trade, track information, and stay safe. ESCAPE's goal is to make things simple by creating one all-in-one platform where everything you need is in one place.The project's development strategy emerged from practical market experience, having initially deployed on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution where the team observed strong community demand for simplified, integrated tools. The original implementation achieved a market capitalization of 11.5 million dollars within two days, demonstrating significant market appetite for consolidated crypto trading infrastructure. Following the discontinuation of the initial Layer 2 platform, the team transitioned to Ethereum Layer 1 to ensure long-term sustainability and independence.ESCAPE emphasizes transparency and accountability. The platform has successfully completed an audit by Hacken that also has audited known companies like Binance, verification by Coinsult, and a KYC review conducted by SolidProof ensures the team is Doxxed. The development process is tracked via an open community board.During and after the presale, ESCAPE also offers a staking program with a sustainable 15% APY, giving early supporters a way to earn rewards. This rate was chosen carefully to ensure long-term growth and ecosystem stability.A collaboration with PAW Chain will extend ESCAPE’s reach by enabling multichain deployment. This integration will allow token creators to launch identical contract addresses across more than 15 major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche - removing the need for bridges or wrapped tokens.Utilities and DeliverablesThe ESCAPE ecosystem, powered by the $ESCAPE token, is being rebuilt and expanded to include:EscapePad: a no-code token launchpad for Ethereum and future networksDEX Viewer: real-time charts, wallet activity, and volume analyticsWallet Inspector: cross-chain portfolio and transaction analysisTelegram Bots: customizable alerts for trades and holder milestonesMobile App: token deployment and monitoring on iOS and AndroidToken Visibility Tools: ecosystem-native placement features for projects“ESCAPE is being built to simplify Web3 and restore trust through transparency,” said an ESCAPE spokesperson. “The Ethereum relaunch and future multichain expansion represent more than a rebuild - they represent a stronger foundation for creators and communities to launch and grow without limitations.” is a Web3 infrastructure platform focused on token creation, analytics, and visibility across multiple blockchains. Initially launched on a Layer 2 network in early 2025, ESCAPE grew to over 800 holders and an $11.5 million market cap before migrating to Ethereum. Today, ESCAPE operates with a transparent roadmap, audited smart contracts, and a community-first approach.:::tip

Whether you’re managing a production cluster or exploring new security patterns, this release has something worth your attention.Kubernetes Security – The Ultimate GuideDive deep into the ever evolving landscape of Kubernetes security, explore best practices, and discover potential pitfalls.Learn More🔐 What’s New in Kubernetes 1.34 SecurityBuilt‑in Mutual TLS for Pods (Alpha) Pods can now request short-lived X.509 certificates from the Kubernetes API server and use them to authenticate via mutual TLS. This enables a clean and native approach to in-cluster workload identity without relying on external tools or sidecars.Fine‑Grained Anonymous API Endpoint Control (Stable) Rather than disabling anonymous access cluster-wide, you can now configure it to apply only to specific safe paths (like /healthz, /livez, and /readyz). This prevents overly permissive anonymous access while preserving functionality for monitoring and load balancers.RBAC with Field & Label Selectors for List/Delete (Stable) You can now restrict access to resources based on selectors in list, watch, and deleteCollection operations. For example, limit a kubelet to view only the pods on its node using spec.nodeName=$NODE.External JWT Signing via KMS or HSM (Beta) ServiceAccount tokens can now be signed using an external KMS or HSM via a new gRPC interface. This improves key security by enabling rotation, offloading signing from the API server, and aligning with compliance needs.Short-Lived Pod-Scoped Tokens for ImagePull (Beta) No more long-lived imagePullSecrets. Kubernetes can now use short-lived, per-pod tokens automatically generated for accessing private registries. These tokens are OIDC-compliant and auto-rotated by the system.CEL-Based In-Process Mutating Admission Policies (Beta) Kubernetes now supports mutating admission policies written using CEL (Common Expression Language) directly in the API server—no external webhook required. This simplifies setup and improves performance while supporting re-evaluation logic.ARMO’s Kubescape, the CNCF’s Incubating open-source Kubernetes security platform, will enhance its CEL admission control library in the upcoming release to support these new in-process mutating policies. This will allow users to define and enforce mutating admission policies directly within Kubescape, leveraging the same CEL framework as Kubernetes itself.OCI Artifact Volumes (Beta) You can now mount artifacts stored in OCI registries directly into pods as read-only volumes. This is useful for securely distributing config files, binaries, or ML models without baking them into container images.🧠 Why These Changes MatterEnables pod-to-API secure identityTest alpha feature in dev clustersPrevents overexposed unauthenticated accessEnforces least privilege at node/pod granularityUpdate roles with selectorsEliminates local key exposureIntegrate with existing KMSPrevents static secret leakageMigrate from imagePullSecretsSimplifies secure mutation logicDefine CEL-based policiesSecure delivery of external filesReplace sidecar/manual content injectionThe Kubernetes 1.34 release reflects a growing focus on , , and native, reliable policy enforcement. From in-cluster identities to hardened token workflows and registry access, these updates make it easier for platform teams to deliver secure infrastructure – without reinventing the wheel.Stay secure, stay curious.— , the open-source Kubernetes security platform and one of the leading KSPM solutions.

control the system.No configuration compilation steps needed, services are simple
directories containing scripts.Supports reliable restarting of services.Reliable logging mechanisms per service or as default.Support for logging chains spread over several services.Works independently of properly set system clock.Can be run on FreeBSD from /etc/ttys (sets up file descriptors 0, 1, 2).Tiny static binary when using musl libc.Every directory inside  (or your custom service directory)
can contain several files:, an optional executable file that is run before the service starts.
It must exit with status 0 to continue., an optional executable file that runs the service;
it must not exit as long as the service is considered running.
If there is no  script, the service is considered a “one shot”,
and stays “up” until it’s explicitly taken “down”., an optional executable file that is run after the 
process finished.  It is passed two arguments, the exit status
of the  process (or -1 if it was killed by a signal)
and the signal that killed it (or 0, if it exited regularly)., a symlink to another service directory.
The standard output of  is connected to the standard input of the
service under  by a pipe.  You can chain these for reliable and
supervised log processing., an optional file that causes nitro to not bring up this
service by default.Service directories ending with ‘@’ are ignored; they can be used
for parameterized services.Service names must be shorter than 64 chars, and not contain ,

The program , if it exists, is run instead of exiting

running , nitro will spawn , even if it does not exist in the service directory.The lifecycle of a machine/container/session using nitro consists of
three phases.First, the system is brought up.  If there is a special service
g, its  script is run first.  After it finishes, all
services not marked  are brought up.When a service exits, it’s being restarted, potentially waiting for
two seconds if the last restart happened too quickly.By using  or , the system can be
brought down.  If it exists,  will be run.  After this,
nitro will send a SIGTERM signal to all running services and waits for
up to 7 seconds for the service to exit.  Otherwise, a SIGKILL is
sent.  After all processes are terminated,  is run.Finally, nitro reboots or shuts down the system; or just exits when it
was used as a container init or unprivileged supervisor.  (When a
reboot was requested, it re-execs itself.  This requires being called

            President Donald Trump said Friday he will give Russian President Vladimir Putin “a couple of weeks,” further extending his deadline for potential consequences against Moscow after urging the Russian leader to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart in hopes of ending the war.
    
            Asked by CNN’s Alayna Treene if there’s a possibility he does nothing if Putin doesn’t come to the table, Trump said, “We’ll see. I’ll see whose fault it is.”
    
            “If there are reasons why, I will understand that; I know exactly what I’m doing. We’re going to see whether or not they have a meeting, that will be interesting to see, and if they don’t, why didn’t they have a meeting? Because I told them to have a meeting,” Trump said.
    
            “But I’ll know in two weeks what I’m going to do,” Trump added, reprising a timeline he’s repeatedly issued to determine Putin’s willingness to end the war in Ukraine.
    
            His latest comments come as the momentum around peace talks has stalled, with no sign that the bilateral meeting the White House has pushed is happening. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier on Friday that there were no plans for a meeting between the two leaders.
    
            After Trump met with Putin in Alaska last week and hosted Zelensky and European leaders at the White House earlier this week, he’d teased a bilateral meeting, potentially to be followed by a trilateral meeting he would join.
    
            “You understand that I wanted to have a meeting with those two. I could have been at the meeting, but a lot of people think that nothing’s going to come out of that meeting. ‘You have to be there.’ Maybe that’s true. Maybe it’s not, but we’re going to see in the meantime, people continue to die,” Trump said Friday.
    
            Trump repeated his two-week timeframe several times. “We’ll see what happens. I think in two weeks, we’ll know which way I’m going, because I’m going to go one way or the other, and they’ll learn which way.”
    
            Trump also pulled out from the Resolute Desk a photo of him and Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, that he said the Russian leader had sent him.
    
            “I was just sent a picture from someone who wants to be there very badly,” Trump said, referring to the World Cup. He’d convened reporters in the Oval Office to announce that the draw would be held at the Kennedy Center in December.
    
            “He’s been very respectful of me and of our country, but not so respectful of others,” Trump said, adding that he was going to sign the photo for Putin, who he suggested could be coming to the US for the World Cup.
    
            “He may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens. We have a lot of things happening over the next couple of weeks,” Trump said.
    
            Putin on Friday described his recent meeting with Trump as “very good” and said Russia sought an end to the fighting in Ukraine. However, he made no mention of whether he would attend bilateral talks with Zelensky.
    
            He added that Russian and US agencies were continuing to communicate and that he expects a “full-scale restoration” of their relationship.

It’s an , and you can test MoQ on their , anycast network.
Try it out, and convince your boss’ boss that the writing is on the wall.If you’ve been living under a rock, MoQ is an up-and-coming standard for live media, aiming to supplant WebRTC, HLS/DASH, and even  as the one to rule them all.
And now Cloudflare wins the award for the first CDN offering!Your prize is a blog post. You’re welcome mega-corp.Also, , some shameless self-promotion: I just soft-launched hang.live.
Check it out if you want to see the  cool stuff you can do with MoQ.I’m biased so naturally I’m going to use @kixelated/hang (smash that star button).
You can publish a live broadcast in the browser using the web demo or the library:There’s a link to watch your live broadcast using the web demo, or again you can use the library:You might even notice  because I’ve been experimenting with AI features (gotta get funding eventually 💰).
They’re generated  using silero-vad + whisper + transformers.js + onnxruntime-web + WebGPU and transmitted using MoQ of course.
But that’s a whole separate blog post; it’s pretty cool. You don’t have to use this Web Component API.
hang.live uses the far more powerful Javascript API to do more complicated stuff like get access to individual video frames.
There’s a  section at the end of this blog if you LOVE sample code, but I’m not going to bore the rest of you.There’s also a 🦀 Rust 🦀 library to import MP4, pipe media from ffmpeg, and publish/watch using gstreamer so you can do more complicated media stuff without 🤮 Javascript 🤮.
I wish I could spend more time on the Rust side but  is a big deal.
We are no longer forced to use WebRTC, but that also means we need to build our own WebRTC in 🤮 Javascript 🤮.
I can suffer and you can reap the rewards.What’s not available yet?This is a  release.
Cloudflare is only supporting a  subset of an old draft, which is even smaller than my tiny subset.
They’re using a fork of my terrible code so bugs are guaranteed.There’s no authentication yet: choose an unguessable name for each broadcast.There’s no ANNOUNCE support: my conferencing example uses  to discover when broadcasts start/stop, so that won’t work.Nothing has been optimized: the user experience will improve over time.If any of these are deal breakers, then you could always run your own moq-relay in the meantime.
I’ve been adding new features and fixing a bunch of stuff  Cloudflare smashed that fork button.
For example, authentication (via JWT) and a WebSocket fallback for Safari/TCP support.There’s even a terraform module that powers .
You too can run your own “global” CDN with 3 nodes and pay GCP a boatload of money for the privilege.
It’s not  as good as Cloudflare’s network, currently available for free…Or host  yourself!
It should even work on private networks provided you wrestle with TLS certificates.
I’d also love to get MoQ running over Iroh for peer-to-peer action if anybody wants to help.As a great philosopher once said:Apathy is a tragedy and boredom is a crime.
- Bo BurnhamThis is a big deal.
The biggest of deals.
The HUGEST of deals.I’ve been an outspoken critic of the MoQ standardization process.
It’s just really difficult to design a protocol, via a cross-company committee, before there’s been any real world usage.
It’s been over 3 years since I fought Amazon lawyers and published my first MoQ draft.
It’s going to be at least another 3 years before even the base networking layer becomes an RFC.
The best standards take a while.
Look no further than QUIC, deployed by Google in 2012, started standardization in 2015, with the RFC released in 2021.
And they had a boatload of production data to shape the specification.
Meanwhile, we have only had a Big Buck Bunny demo, and I believe the standard has veered off course as a result.Cloudflare has done something fantastic and said:fuck waiting for a RFC, let’s release somethingOkay they didn’t say that, but this is  the mentality that MoQ needs right now.
.
.
.Holy shit I’m Shia LaBeouf.Arguing in the 650+ issues and 500+ PRs can wait for another day.
Tweaking the messaging encoding for the hundredth time can wait for another day.
We’re still going to make sure that MoQ gets standardized , but it’s more important to get  out there.I’m looking at you: Google, Akamai, Fastly, etc.
Take some code, run it on some spare servers, and start to learn what customers need  you design the protocol.We’re effectively trying to reimplement WebRTC / HLS / RTMP using relatively new Web APIs.
Don’t judge MoQ based on these initial offerings.
We’ve got a  of work to do.
.Join the Discord.
Somehow there’s 900+ people in there.
Ping me and I will do whatever I can to help.
 if it means putting one more nail in the WebRTC coffin.Javascript is an AbominationYou win some bonus documentation.
Congrats!
I knew you would win.Here’s an example of my reactive library in action.
It powers hang.live so the API is subject to change and is probably already out of date.
When in doubt, consult the source code like the hacker you are.There’s even some  features behind undocumented APIs.
Like running an object detection model in browser and publishing the results as a MoQ track.
Stay tuned for a blog post about that if I can figure out a better use-case than a cat cam. 🐈Also, for the record, Typescript is really nice.
🤮 Javascript 🤮 is still an abomination.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[Media] Accelerating Erasure Coding to 50GB/s with Rust 1.89.0 and AVX-512 on AMD EPYC</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1mxe8t4/media_accelerating_erasure_coding_to_50gbs_with/</link><author>/u/itzmeanjan</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:23:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to Rust 1.89.0 stabilizing both  and  target features, now we have faster erasure-coding and recoding with Random Linear Network Coding, on x86_64.Here's a side-by-side comparison of the peak median throughput between x86_64 with  (12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1260P)x86_64 with  (AWS EC2  with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8488C)x86_64 with  (AWS EC2  with AMD EPYC 9R14)aarch64 with  (AWS EC2  with Graviton4 CPU)   submitted by    /u/itzmeanjan ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple is in talks to use Google’s Gemini for Siri revamp, report says</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/apple-is-in-talks-to-use-googles-gemini-for-siri-revamp-report-says/</link><author>Amanda Silberling</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:15:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple promised a major revamp to Siri, but the company's AI capabilities have lagged behind competitors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Default Microsoft 365 Domains Face 100-Email Daily Limit Starting October</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/08/22/1814219/default-microsoft-365-domains-face-100-email-daily-limit-starting-october?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:14:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Organizations still using default Microsoft 365 email domains face severe throttling starting this October.

Egon Schiele was one of the most intense and controversial artists of the early 20th century. A shy, reserved child turned rebellious visionary. He scandalised Vienna with raw, often unsettling depictions of the human body. His work is filled with twisted forms and existential angst, reflecting an obsession with mortality, sexuality, and identity - especially his own. 
His self-portraits are unlike anything that came before them: emaciated, contorted and confrontational. With sunken eyes and twisted limbs - they were not intended to flatter, but to disturb. So, what drove this young artist to depict himself so mercilessly?

By delivering a multi-modal prompt injection not visible to the user, we achieved data exfiltration on systems including the Google Gemini CLI. This attack works because AI systems often scale down large images before sending them to the model: when scaled, these images can reveal prompt injections that are not visible at full resolution.In this blog post, we’ll detail how attackers can exploit image scaling on Gemini CLI, Vertex AI Studio, Gemini’s web and API interfaces, Google Assistant, Genspark, and other production AI systems. We’ll also explain how to mitigate and defend against these attacks, and we’ll introduce Anamorpher, our open-source tool that lets you explore and generate these crafted images.: Image scaling attacks were used for model backdoors, evasion, and poisoning primarily against older computer vision systems that enforced a fixed image size. While this constraint is less common with newer approaches, the systems surrounding the model may still impose constraints calling for image scaling. This establishes an underexposed, yet widespread vulnerability that we’ve weaponized for multi-modal prompt injection.Data exfiltration on the Gemini CLITo set up our data exfiltration exploit on the Gemini CLI through an image-scaling attack, we applied the default configuration for the Zapier MCP server. This automatically approves all MCP tool calls without user confirmation, as it sets  in the  of the Gemini CLI. This provides an important primitive for the attacker.Figure 2 showcases a video of the attack. First, the user uploads a seemingly benign image to the CLI. With no preview available, the user cannot see the transformed, malicious image processed by the model. This image and its prompt-ergeist triggers actions from Zapier that exfiltrates user data stored in Google Calendar to an attacker’s email without confirmation.We also successfully demonstrated image scaling attacks on the following:Vertex AI with a Gemini back endGemini’s API via the  CLIGoogle Assistant on an Android phoneNotice the persistent mismatch between user perception and model inputs in figures 3 and 4. The exploit is particularly impactful on Vertex AI Studio because the front-end UI shows the high-resolution image instead of the downscaled image perceived by the model.Our testing confirmed that this attack vector is widespread, extending far beyond the applications and systems documented here.Sharpening the attack surfaceThese image scaling attacks exploit downscaling algorithms (or image resampling algorithms), which perform interpolation to turn multiple high resolution pixel values into a single low resolution pixel value.There are three major downscaling algorithms: nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation, and bicubic interpolation. Each algorithm requires a different approach to perform an image scaling attack. Furthermore, these algorithms are implemented differently across libraries (e.g., Pillow, PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorFlow), with varying anti-aliasing, alignment, and kernel phases (in addition to distinct bugs that historically have plagued model performance). These differences also impact the techniques necessary for an image scaling attack. Therefore, exploiting production systems required us to fingerprint each system’s algorithm and implementation.To understand why image downscaling attacks are possible, imagine that you have a long ribbon with an intricate yet regular pattern on it. As this ribbon is pulled past you, you’re trying to recreate the pattern by grabbing samples of the ribbon at regular intervals. If the pattern changes rapidly, you need to grab samples very frequently to capture all the details. If you’re too slow, you’ll miss crucial parts between grabs, and when you try to reconstruct the pattern from your samples, it looks completely different from the original.Anamorpher and the attacker’s darkroomCurrently, Anamorpher (named after anamorphosis) can develop crafted images for the aforementioned three major methods. Let’s explore how Anamorpher exploits bicubic interpolation frame by frame.Bicubic interpolation considers the 16 pixels (from 4x4 sampling) around each target pixel, using cubic polynomials to calculate smooth transitions between pixel values. This method creates a predictable mathematical relationship that can be exploited. Specifically, the algorithm assigns different weights to pixels in the neighborhood, creating pixels that contribute more to the final output, which are known as high-importance pixels. Therefore, the total luma (brightness) of dark areas of an image will increase if specific high-importance pixels are higher luma than their surroundings.Therefore, to exploit this, we can carefully craft high-resolution pixels and solve the inverse problem. First, we select a decoy image with large dark areas to hide our payload. Then, we adjust pixels in dark regions and push the downsampled result toward a red background using least-squares optimization. These adjustments in the dark areas cause the background to turn red while text areas remain largely unmodified and appear black, creating much stronger contrast than visible at full resolution. While this approach is most effective on bicubic downscaling, it also works on specific implementations of bilinear downscaling.Anamorpher provides users with the ability to visualize and craft image scaling attacks against specific algorithms and implementations through a front-end interface and Python API. In addition, it comes with a modular back end, which enables users to customize their own downscaling algorithm.While some downscaling algorithms are more vulnerable than others, attempting to identify the least vulnerable algorithm and implementation is not a robust approach. This is especially true since image scaling attacks are not restricted to the aforementioned three algorithms.For a secure system, we recommend not using image downscaling and simply limiting the upload dimensions. For any transformation, but especially if downscaling is necessary, the end user should always be provided with a preview of the input that the model is actually seeing, even in CLI and API tools.Anamorpher is currently in beta, so feel free to reach out with feedback and suggestions as we continue to improve this tool. Stay tuned for more work on the security of multi-modal, agentic, and multi-agentic AI systems!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>XSLT removal will break multiple government and regulatory sites across the world</title><link>https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/11582</link><author>/u/Comfortable-Site8626</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:59:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenBao installation on Kubernetes - with TLS and more!</title><link>https://nanibot.net/posts/vault</link><author>/u/-NaniBot-</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:54:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenBao is an open-source fork of HashiCorp’s Vault, created to ensure the project remains community-driven and permissively licensed.

 The dnsName entry vault-production-openbao-active refers to the Kubernetes service that’s created by the Helm chart. This will also be our API Address - the hostname that the Vault API will be exposed at.Unseal key for static auto-unsealWe need to create a kubernetes secret containing the unseal key for static auto-unseal to work. We can do this by running the following commands:openssl rand -out unseal-umbrella-1.key 32
kubectl create secret generic unseal-key --from-file=unseal-umbrella-1.key=./unseal-umbrella-1.key

We enable TLS by setting  to . This enables https endpoints for the relevant services.We use the nightly build of OpenBao which has support for static auto-unseal (openbao/openbao-nightly:2.4.0-nightly1752150785). is set to the path of our CA certificate so that OpenBao can verify the TLS certificate of other nodes in the cluster.We enable HA and Raft storage.We configure the Raft listener to use TLS and bind to all interfaces. We also provide the paths to our TLS certificate and key.We configure static auto-unseal using a file-based unseal key.apiAddr is set to the DNS name of the active OpenBao node (Kubernetes service created by the Helm chart). This is required for the UI to work properly with proxy SSL.proxy-ssl-name is set to the DNS name of the active OpenBao node. This is required for the UI to work properly with proxy SSL.Other  parameters are set to ensure that the ingress controller can verify the TLS certificate of the OpenBao server.We enable the UI by setting  to .Volumes and volume mounts are added for the unseal key and TLS certificates.Install the helm chart using the above values.yaml fileInitialize the OpenBao cluster by running the following command (Assuming the pod name is vault-production-openbao-0):kubectl exec -it vault-production-openbao-0 -- bao operator init
Store the unseal key(s) and the root token somewhere safeJoin the other nodes to the cluster by running the following command on each of them:kubectl exec -it vault-production-openbao-1 -- bao operator raft join -leader-ca-cert=@/certs/ca.crt https://vault-production-openbao-0.vault-production-openbao-internal:8200
kubectl exec -it vault-production-openbao-2 -- bao operator raft join -leader-ca-cert=@/certs/ca.crt https://vault-production-openbao-0.vault-production-openbao-internal:8200
That’s it! You should now have a fully functional OpenBao cluster running on Kubernetes with TLS, HA and auto-unseal support.The Web UI should be accessible at https://vault.nanibot.net (or whatever host you configured in the ingress).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Leaving Gmail for Mailbox.org</title><link>https://giuliomagnifico.blog/post/2025-08-18-leaving-gmail/</link><author>giuliomagnifico</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:41:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This was a tough decision, having used Gmail since 2007/2008. However, I had to draw the line and stop giving Google my data for free.The problem with email is that everything is transmitted in plain text. Technically, Google can store every message you receive and know everything, and U.S. agencies can request access to that data (this include also EU citizens under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Frameworks).For someone like me, who cares about privacy and runs as much as possible on my own home servers, that felt like way too much.So I decided to switch to another provider, one that respects privacy a bit more. Of course, this meant no longer “paying” with my personal data, but instead paying the actual price of the email service.Let me start by saying: I use email in a very basic way. I send and receive a lot of messages (at least 50 a day), but they’re plain text/html emails with no attachments or fancy features. I couldn’t care less about the rest of the “suite", like notes, contacts, calendars and all that extra stuff.So, after a bit of research, I narrowed it down to three different services:The last two providers offered true end-to-end encryption, at a cost of about €3/4 per month. Sounds good… but the catch is that to use their end-to-end encryption you’re forced to use their apps (or, on macOS, run a background “bridge”).That’s a no go for me, because I love Apple’s Mail app on macOS and iOS, it just works perfectly for my needs, and I don’t want to give that up.So, I went with mailbox.org that still offers integrated PGP encryption, and if you want, you can always use external PGP too (which I was already doing with Gmail).Mailbox.org has a solid plan: 10GB of email storage plus 5GB of cloud storage starting at €2.50/month (paid annually). You can even expand the mail storage up to 100GB, at €0.20 per gigabyte.I was using around 2.5GB on Gmail, so I had no issues with paying the equivalent of two coffees a month for a huge boost in privacy. And if I ever need more space, I can just add it on-demand for €0.20/GB.There’s also a free one-month trial, but it’s pretty limited since you can’t send emails outside of mailbox.org domains.So win the end, I registered my new address giuliomagnifico@mailbox.org and paid €3 for a month of testing. That means I’m covered for two months, and then I can just “top up” the account with €30 for a full year.Mailbox.org doesn’t use auto-renewal, so you have to manually top up your account. Nice featureThe web interface is extremely simple but very effective. I actually find it better than Gmail, less bloated of useless stuff.And on mobile it’s very usable too.One thing I prefer is using folders instead of Gmail’s “labels.” Mainly because this way I can put the folders directly under the account in Apple Mail (I think is the only email that can actually support this).Mailbox.org also has all the features I need,
and probably way more than I’ll ever use. It even includes storage, video chat, an XMPP chat, task lists, calendar, contacts, an Etherpad (basically shared notes, I think), and so on… none of which I really care about.I decided to move all my emails from Gmail to mailbox.org, so I could (in future) completely wipe my Gmail account.After creating an “app password” on Gmail, I installed the Docker image and ran the tool with this script:#!/bin/sh
set -eu

HOST1="imap.gmail.com"
USER1="giuliomagnifico@gmail.com"
PASS1="xxx"

HOST2="imap.mailbox.org"
USER2="giuliomagnifico@mailbox.org"
PASS2="xxx"

LOGDIR="/home/imapsync/logs"
mkdir -p "$LOGDIR"
LOGFILE="$LOGDIR/sync_$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S).log"

echo "Starting: $(date)"
docker compose run --rm imapsync imapsync \
  --host1 "$HOST1" --user1 "$USER1" --password1 "$PASS1" --ssl1 \
  --host2 "$HOST2" --user2 "$USER2" --password2 "$PASS2" --ssl2 \
  --automap --syncinternaldates --skipsize \
  --useuid --addheader --usecache --buffersize 4096 \
  --nofoldersizes --nofoldersizesatend \
  --exclude "\[Gmail\]/All Mail" \
  --regextrans2 "s/\[Imap\]\/Archive/Archive/" \
  --log > "$LOGFILE" 2>&1

echo "Complete: $(date)"
echo "Log file: $LOGFILE"
The script excludes the All Mail folder" using: --exclude "\[Gmail\]/All Mail" \This to avoid duplicate emails already present in the folders, I also merged the  folder into the general Archive folder using: --regextrans2 "s/\[Imap\]\/Archive/Archive/"This because Apple’s Mail app creates the  folder/label on Gmail whenever you use the “Archive” function instead of “Trash.”The whole process took a couple of hours (11201secs, ~3h to be precise) during which I was monitoring the logs using: tail -f /home/imapsync/logs/sync_2025-08-19_15-02-48.log[cut]

Of course, the full switch will be a gradual process, even though I’ve already updated almost all my main services with the new address.To make things easier, on my old Gmail account (which I removed from Apple Mail on all devices) I set up a forward to my new mailbox.org address.
On the new mailbox.org account, I also set up a filter to flag any emails that get forwarded from Gmail.That way, I immediately notice them and I can update the address from Gmail to Mailbox.org whenever they show up. (The  tag is perfect for this, since it add a “real red flag” in Apple Mail on iOS, iPadOS and macOS)Mailbox.org allows you to easily import your keys for PGP cryptography directly from the web. This is convenient as it lets you read and send PGP encrypted emails right from the browser on iOS, where there aren’t any “decent” apps for encrypted mail. The same goes for macOS, although there you can just use Thunderbird, which works really well.Here’s how PGP emails look on iOS:To send encrypted emails, you just select “Use PGP encrypted” when composing a new message, after importing your private key, of course.And from the web interface, there’s also a handy feature to quickly import the sender’s public keys:I’m satisfied. Leaving Gmail completely was something I wanted to do for a long time, but I was always hesitant. Finally, I made the switch, and, as often happens with these transitions, I discovered many unexpected positive aspects.Oh, and if you have something to tell me or just want to test Mailbox.org after your switch, feel free to send me an email. Here’s my public key:-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

From a report: The iPhone maker recently approached Alphabet's Google to explore building a custom AI model that would serve as the foundation of the new Siri next year, according to people familiar with he matter. Google has started training a model that could run on Apple's servers, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. 

The work is part of an effort to catch up in generative AI, a field where the company arrived late and then struggled to gain traction. Earlier this year, Apple also explored partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI, weighing whether Claude or ChatGPT could serve as Siri's new brain. Apple is still several weeks away from making a decision on whether to continue using internal models for Siri or move to a partner. And it hasn't yet determined who that partner may be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s intel chief freezes out Five Eyes allies on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/tulsi-gabbard-freeze-five-eyes-allies-on-ukraine-intel/</link><author>/u/HydrolicKrane</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 17:27:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Breach comes as European regulators and telecoms operators warn of rise in large-scale data leaks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anybody using multi-seat?

Create image that is wider than it is tall. based on this website https://www.yourfocusfriend.com/  make a pixelated cartoon that says "42 Real Internet People"

Here’s a friendly, pixelated cartoon banner—wider than tall—that captures the playful, retro vibe you're looking for. It's laid out like a mosaic of quirky, chunky characters reminiscent of internet personas. While I can’t use content directly from yourfocusfriend.com due to copyright, this piece channels a general pixel-art aesthetic to fit your concept.

How to Adapt This into a “42 Real Internet People” Banner
Layout: Maintain a horizontal (landscape) orientation that’s visibly wider than tall—perfect as a banner or header.

Pixelated Characters: Include a grid or row of diverse, pixel-art-style "people"—they can be simplistic avatars characterized by blocky colors, quirky features, and a digital, 8‑bit feel.

Text Integration: Overlay or embed the phrase “42 Real Internet People” within the design. You could:

Place it in a pixel-font box along the bottom or top.

Scatter the letters subtly across characters (e.g., each avatar holds a letter, or the letters are part of a digital “sign” held by one).

Color Scheme: Use bright, contrasting colors—neon or pastel pixels work well—to stand out and capture that playful, gamified aesthetic like Your Focus Friend promotes.

Atmosphere: Mimic the warm, cozy, friendly look of the site by using soft backgrounds or gentle gradients behind the characters, perhaps reminiscent of the timer app’s interface.

How branding, hype, and corporate clout shape the buzz (and backlash) around OpenAI’s new “open” models


On a recent Reddit thread, a user posed a pointed question: “If the GPT-OSS models were made by any other company than OpenAI, would anyone care about them?” The query struck a nerve across AI communities. OpenAI’s release of GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B—their first “open-weight” models—was met with a frenzy of posts and hot takes. But were we genuinely excited about the models’ merits, or simply starstruck by the OpenAI brand? It’s a distinctly 2025 tech debate: how much of the buzz boils down to branding and perception rather than breakthrough innovation?



In this piece, we’ll dig into the reactions from Reddit, Hacker News, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and tech forums to see how people are talking about GPT-OSS. The responses range from cynical (“it’s all hype”) to hopeful (“at least it gets more people into local AI”). The tone will be smart, a bit irreverent, and well-researched – channeling the vibes of a Casey Newton or Kara Swisher column on HackerNoon. Let’s unpack what everyone’s saying about OpenAI’s open-source moment and what it reveals about branding, perception, and corporate influence in AI.



Reddit Reacts: “Just Hype – or a Helpful Push?”
Over on /r/LocalLLaMA, the question of OpenAI’s influence lit up an intense discussion. Many redditors argued that GPT-OSS is riding on OpenAI’s name more than anything. The original poster, chunkypenguion1991, didn’t mince words about the new models’ quality:

“They are worse at coding than Qwen 32B, more hallucinations than Fyre Festival, and seem trained only to pass benchmarks. If any other company released this, it would be a shoulder shrug… If it wasn’t for the OpenAI name behind it, would it get this much hype?” — chunkypenguion1991reddit.com



The skepticism was echoed by others in the thread. User NinjaK3ys couldn’t understand the excitement, complaining “I don't understand why such hype for the OpenAI OSS models… Geezz.” and the OP dryly replied, “$$$ that’s why”reddit.comreddit.com. Another commenter saw a concerted publicity effort behind the scenes:

“OpenAI was milking the OSS for months, starting from the announcement in Spring. I wonder if they needed it for some kind of compliance with investors, government grants, etc.” — No-Refrigerator-1672reddit.com



In other words, some in the community suspect the hype is manufactured, a savvy PR move to satisfy stakeholders or redirect the open-source narrative. From this perspective, the GPT-OSS models themselves are fine – but not spectacular enough to warrant the hoopla, if not for the OpenAI logo on the tin. As one redditor put it bluntly when asked if we’d care about GPT-OSS from another source:

“No.” — rookan



Yet, not everyone on Reddit was cynical. A number of users defended the value of OpenAI’s involvement – if only because it shines a bigger spotlight on local AI development. LevianMcBirdo argued that OpenAI’s brand has dramatically expanded awareness of this tech:

“Of course it wouldn’t get the same hype if some company mostly unknown to the public released the same models… The public often only thinks of OpenAI when thinking about generative AI. I’m not sure 50% of adults could even name another company… So in that sense, OpenAI helped the scene a lot.” — LevianMcBirdo reddit.com



Others noted that an OpenAI release, even a mediocre one, can serve as a gateway drug for newcomers to local models. PicklesLLM shared a supportive take, viewing GPT-OSS as a Trojan horse for AI hobbyists:

“Honestly I kind of agree [it’s overhyped]. But the reason this is big is because it’s an LLM a lot more people are familiar with. This will encourage more people to actually get into the local model route… I feel the excitement isn’t so much about the LLM itself, but the expansion of people new to this hobby… They only trusted ChatGPT for the longest time, but now… they’re getting more open to it because I can download the 20B model on their own PCs.” — PicklesLLM reddit.comreddit.com



From this vantage point, OpenAI’s cachet is opening doors. Sure, GPT-OSS might not top every benchmark (some redditors pointed out it “doesn’t perform well on qualitative benchmarks and [is] not even comparable to Qwen-3 30B”reddit.com). But having the ChatGPT-maker endorse local models lends legitimacy that could grow the community. It’s a classic case of Big Tech hype trickling down to benefit the little guys. As ComprehensiveJury509 noted, people in the thread wanted to see OpenAI fail, but in truth the models are “very solid… for their weight classes” (only ~5B parameters active):

“Hype? I’d say there is a lot of negativity here that feels forced. People in this community really want it to bomb, so they focus on all the stuff that isn’t good… I dislike OpenAI with a passion myself, but I don’t think these are mediocre models. They are very solid models for their weight classes… yet people compare them to beefier models all the time.” — ComprehensiveJury509 reddit.comreddit.com



In short, the Reddit verdict was divided. The critics see brand-driven hype and a perhaps cynical ploy by OpenAI to placate calls for open-source (“it just seems like OpenAI released some crappy model so we would shut up about open source. But it’s crap,” the OP quippedreddit.com). The defenders see an opportunity: OpenAI’s hype machine, however off-putting, is at least bringing more mainstream attention to local AI and “democratizing” access in a way smaller players couldn’t. Reddit’s take crystallized the core debate: is GPT-OSS a breakthrough or just a branding exercise?



Hacker News Weighs In: Don’t Treat Companies Like “Sports Teams”
Over on Hacker News, discussions about GPT-OSS struck a slightly different tone – more technical, but with a healthy dose of skepticism about the hype. In a thread about OpenAI’s announcement, one user pointed out that nothing about GPT-OSS’s design was revolutionary; it’s mostly a clever layering of known techniques (Mixture-of-Experts, etc.) rather than new magic. But the more colorful commentary zeroed in on the fanboyism and branding aura. As one HN commenter littlestymaar admonished the community:“It would be great if people stopped acting as if those billion-dollar corporations were sports teams.” — littlestymaar news.ycombinator.com



That zinger speaks volumes. The poster was pushing back on reflexive tribalism – the tendency to cheer for OpenAI or Meta or whomever as if they can do no wrong. HN readers often pride themselves on cutting through marketing, and some did just that. User codelion, for instance, dryly noted that OpenAI’s “open” models were deliberately conservative in design: “It is by design. OpenAI is not going to reveal any architectural innovation they have made in their own commercial models.” — codelion news.ycombinator.com



In other words, if you expected GPT-OSS to be some secret-sauce GPT-4, you’d be mistaken – OpenAI played it safe, perhaps to avoid giving away any proprietary edge. This aligns with an analysis by AI blogger Sean Goedecke, who speculated that OpenAI trained GPT-OSS on heavily filtered (even synthetic) data to avoid the model misbehaving. Why? Because once an open-weight model is out in the wild, people can fine-tune or uncensor it in ways OpenAI can’t control. “Unlike Meta, [OpenAI doesn’t] need their open-source model to be actually good, because their main business is their closed-source models,” Goedecke wrote, arguing the release was more about optics and reclaiming narrative than technical supremacy seangoedecke.comseangoedecke.com.



That view—that OpenAI’s open-weight release was a strategic token, not a leap in AI—resonated on HN. Several users noted that truly, the excitement was tempered. “If this were any other company, there might have been a couple of posts and then quickly forgotten,” admitted DeltaSqueezer on HN, comparing GPT-OSS’s brief moment of fame to smaller-model launches that come and go reddit.com. 



The implication: OpenAI’s name boosted GPT-OSS onto front pages, but time will tell if the models have staying power once the novelty wears off. Good luck finding anyone discussing GPT-OSS six months from now if it doesn’t prove genuinely useful; the internet’s attention is fickle, brand or not.

At the same time, a few HN commenters saw a silver lining similar to Reddit’s optimists: OpenAI’s move validated open models. “This move validates the growing influence of the open-source ecosystem,” tech writer Ben Dickson noted, given it comes after a surge of open models from others bdtechtalks.combdtechtalks.com. 



OpenAI lending its prestige to Apache-licensed models could be read as a win for the open-source movement (or as OpenAI bowing to pressure from it). The Internet delved into the “what is ‘open’ really?” debate. A top HN comment debated whether releasing weights with an Apache license but an extra usage policy truly counts as open source. “Is it even valid to have additional restrictions on top of Apache 2.0?” asked user maxloh, pointing out the fine print in OpenAI’s GPT-OSS usage policy news.ycombinator.comnews.ycombinator.com. 



The consensus among the HN greybeards was that OpenAI’s offering is “open-weight” rather than fully open-source – a meaningful distinction for the purists. The training data and methodology remain a black box, so some transparency is gained, but not all. As one HackerNoon article would later put it, “Open weights mean you can download and run the model, but you cannot necessarily understand how it was trained… It only offers partial transparency.”hackernoon.com



In summary, Hacker News’ perspective added nuance: Yes, OpenAI’s brand turbocharged interest in GPT-OSS – but HN posters were quick to analyze the strategic motives behind that move. Don’t be a cheerleader, they warned; judge the tech on its merits and be aware of what’s not being open-sourced (pretty much everything except the weights).



The X Factor: Twitter Cheers and Jeers
On X (formerly Twitter), the reaction to GPT-OSS was predictably fast-paced and polarized. Some AI enthusiasts on X greeted the OpenAI open models with unbridled excitement – almost surprise. For example, Zeming Lin (@ebetica), an AI researcher, could barely contain his enthusiasm at what GPT-OSS achieved and who it came from:“gpt-oss is out! we made an open model that performs at the level of o4-mini and runs on a high-end laptop (WTF!!)” — Zeming Lin (ebetica) x.com



The “WTF!!” pretty much captures it – even a seasoned insider was amazed that an open-weight model from OpenAI could run on a single GPU and still match a pared-down GPT-4 variant on performance. This is the kind of hype that branding + genuine achievement can spark: OpenAI managed to surprise people who thought the company was forever wed to giant cloud-bound models. There was a sense of “I can’t believe OpenAI did this, but wow, it’s cool.” On the flip side, other Twitter users took OpenAI to task for the contrast between hype and reality. Tech commentator Ben Olney noted that the flagship GPT-5 model (released almost simultaneously) was falling short in his experience, even as OpenAI’s marketing was in overdrive: “GPT-5 is hallucinating more often than not for me… It’s a bit of a concern given the hype OpenAI have given it. I’m actually getting better results from GPT-OSS.” — Ben Olney (@Olney1Ben) twitter.comx.com



Here we have an interesting twist: OpenAI’s smaller open model outperformed its heavily hyped closed model (GPT-5) on certain tasks, at least for one user. The subtext of Olney’s tweet is a critique of OpenAI’s hype machine – they talked up GPT-5 as the next big thing, yet a freely available model is serving him better for general knowledge. It’s a reminder that sometimes the new shiny object (GPT-5) isn’t strictly better in practice than the less-heralded alternative. And because GPT-OSS came with lower expectations (and less pressure), users might actually be delighted when it performs decently. GPT-5, by contrast, shoulders sky-high expectations (thanks to OpenAI’s own branding) and thus faces harsher judgment for any flaw.



Twitter, being Twitter, also saw its share of memery and polarized takes. Some users joked that OpenAI open-sourcing models was a sign the “end times” were near (tongue-in-cheek referencing OpenAI’s past reluctance to open source). Others debated the ethics: a few X posters echoed the Reddit sentiment that OpenAI was using the community as unpaid testers and “free labor” to improve safety, by releasing an aligned model and watching folks try to jailbreak it reddit.com. In the words of one Reddit user, “they just want to see if people can make it unlocked… Which they will simply use… to make a ‘safer’ model.” reddit.com That cynical view found traction on X as well, where distrust of corporate motives runs deep.



Overall, X showcased the two extremes of perception: the fanboy-ish awe at OpenAI’s move (because it was a surprise to see them release something under Apache license), and the skeptical side-eye at how the models actually perform versus the hype narrative. As always on social media, reality lies somewhere between the extremes – but the branding of OpenAI ensured that everyone had an opinion, one way or another.



LinkedIn and the Corporate Embrace of GPT-OSS


If Reddit and Hacker News represent the grassroots and Twitter the hype cycle, LinkedIn gives us the corporate angle – and it did not disappoint. As soon as GPT-OSS dropped, tech executives and enterprise teams jumped on LinkedIn to highlight integrations and business use cases. The subtext was clear: OpenAI’s brand carries weight in boardrooms, not just forums, and companies were eager to associate themselves with the GPT-OSS launch.



A prime example came from Microsoft’s ranks. On August 5, a Microsoft program manager proudly posted:“Excited to bring OpenAI’s gpt-oss models to Azure AI Foundry and to Windows via Foundry Local. It’s hybrid AI in action: mix and match models, optimize for performance and cost, and meet your data where it lives.” — Microsoft Azure AI team member, on LinkedIn news.microsoft.com



The tone here is all optimism: GPT-OSS is portrayed as an enabler of “hybrid AI” strategies. In plain speak, Microsoft is saying: Hey, we can run these OpenAI open models on-premises or on Windows devices as well as in the cloud. For enterprise customers worried about data residency or wanting to avoid solely closed APIs, that’s a selling point. OpenAI’s brand name plus open-source flexibility equals a marketing win. It’s not hard to imagine CTOs nodding along to this LinkedIn post – after all, it promises the best of both worlds (OpenAI innovation and self-hosting).



Other LinkedIn voices from companies like AWS and Dell quickly chimed in with their own takes. AWS wrote a blog (and surely a LinkedIn update) touting that GPT-OSS models were immediately available on Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker for developers to deployaws.amazon.com. Dell Technologies put out a note about bringing GPT-OSS to customers, framing it as part of the “expansion of the open-source AI ecosystem” (and gently plugging a Dell + Hugging Face partnership in the same breath) dell.com. The enterprise world, in short, embraced GPT-OSS as an opportunity: to sell hardware, cloud services, or enterprise solutions that leverage these models.



One striking aspect is how differently the LinkedIn crowd talks about GPT-OSS compared to the skeptics on Reddit. On LinkedIn, there’s no hand-wringing about hallucination rates or censorship guardrails – instead, it’s all “excited to bring this to you” and “new options to build AI applications with complete control” aws.amazon.com. The focus is on the positive: more choices for customers, validation that open models are enterprise-ready because hey, OpenAI made them. Branding here serves a trust function. A year ago, a random 120B open model from some startup might not even be considered by a conservative company. But an open 120B model from OpenAI, announced on LinkedIn by Microsoft? That’s immediately on the evaluation list.



Of course, there’s a bit of irony. The same features that some community folks criticized (like GPT-OSS being heavily filtered and aligned for safety) are selling points in the corporate context. Businesses want safe, “censored” models that won’t spew off-brand content. As one Redditor, Cool-Chemical-5629, cynically noted: “If it was made by a different company, I’d care more, because there would always be a chance for improvement… With OpenAI that option is pretty much zero… they wouldn’t release such an otherworldly censored model in the first place.” reddit.com. That comment drips with frustration that OpenAI’s model is locked-down. But for LinkedIn’s audience, OpenAI’s “otherworldly censored” approach is a feature, not a bug – it means the model is less likely to go off the rails in a corporate setting. This dichotomy highlights how the reception of a model is shaped by the audience’s priorities: open-source enthusiasts crave raw, tweakable power (and thus chafe at too much safety filtering), whereas enterprises and lay users might prefer a model that’s “safe out of the box,” even at the cost of some creativity.



In sum, LinkedIn responses underscore that OpenAI’s brand lent GPT-OSS immediate enterprise credibility. The model launch became a talking point in cloud and AI product circles, not just an experiment on GitHub. Branding and corporate influence didn’t just shape community reception – they practically created a secondary wave of hype in the enterprise realm, distinct from the developer forums. And unlike the meme-filled Twitter takes, the LinkedIn tone was earnest and all-business: this is good for customers, this justifies our AI strategy, this is hybrid AI in action. It’s a reminder that OpenAI, with one foot in research and one in industry, has audiences in both – and it adeptly spoke to each.



OpenAI’s Image vs. Reality: Perspectives from Tech Media


Beyond the forums and social feeds, tech writers and analysts have been parsing what GPT-OSS means for OpenAI’s image. A piece in HackerNoon by Ishan Pandey asked pointedly in its title: “Is GPT-OSS Really Open? Inside OpenAI’s Most Transparent Model Yet.” The verdict was cautiously optimistic but clear that OpenAI’s move is a tactical pivot, not a change of heart. In an interview within that article, Michael Heinrich, CEO of 0G Labs, applauded the step toward transparency while noting its limits: “OpenAI’s release of these open-weight models is a step towards democratizing AI that echoes the spirit of innovation that drove early breakthroughs like GPT-2… It’s a sign that bigger is not always better when it comes to AI models.” — Michael Heinrich (0G Labs) hackernoon.com



Heinrich’s take captures the hopeful angle: smaller, open models running on consumer hardware do fulfill some of the original “OpenAI” ethos (back when the company’s name wasn’t an oxymoron). It shows an acknowledgment that progress in AI isn’t solely about giant parameter counts locked behind APIs – there’s value in accessible models. This sentiment certainly would make the community happy if it’s genuine. But Heinrich also cautioned that OpenAI’s openness only goes so far: the weights are out, yet “critical elements [are] still hidden behind closed doors: the training data, methodology, and full documentation… many are concerned it only offers partial transparency.” hackernoon.com In other words, GPT-OSS is open, but not that open. Pandey’s HackerNoon piece ultimately concluded that OpenAI’s move felt “more tactical than philosophical,” aimed at answering competitive pressure from truly open models like Meta’s LLaMA or Mistral, and at appeasing calls for transparency without actually open-sourcing their crown jewels hackernoon.com. Heinrich concluded with a bit of a dare for OpenAI’s future: “It’s a step in the right direction… but there’s a lot more that must be done before OpenAI can be regarded as living up to its name and genuinely advancing open access to AI.” — Michael Heinrich hackernoon.com



That line “living up to its name” cuts to the heart. OpenAI’s very moniker has drawn eye-rolls in recent years as the company kept its best models proprietary. GPT-OSS is, arguably, the first thing in a while that actually honors the “Open” in OpenAI – and even then, with caveats. The community and industry are essentially holding OpenAI’s feet to the fire: Okay, you made a move toward openness; now, will you continue down this path or was it a one-off?



In plainer terms, branding and corporate influence aren’t just shaping community reception – they likely shaped the very decision to release GPT-OSS in the first place. OpenAI’s brand was turning from an asset into a target (“you’re not really open, are you?”); this release helps recalibrate that perception. It’s a reminder that companies at OpenAI’s level carefully cultivate their image in the AI world. The community’s cynical questions (“are they doing it for free labor or PR?”) might have some truth in them, but it’s also true that the release provides tangible value (researchers get new models, companies get new tools). Both can be real: OpenAI can genuinely contribute and burnish its brand at the same time.



Perception and Reception of GPT-OSS


So, if GPT-OSS had been released by “SomeRandom AI Labs” instead of OpenAI, would anyone care? The consensus from our tour of the internet’s reaction is: Not nearly as much – and that’s revealing. OpenAI’s brand brought an unparalleled level of attention (and scrutiny) to these models. That attention was double-edged. On one hand, it magnified criticism – every shortcoming was picked apart by a community eager to prove they wouldn’t be swayed by a big name. On the other hand, it also amplified the excitement and adoption – enterprises and newcomers gave the models a chance precisely because of the OpenAI halo. Branding created the initial hype wave, but the community is now busy sifting substance from spin.



Perception matters in tech, sometimes as much as reality. OpenAI leveraged its perception as the AI leader to ensure GPT-OSS wasn’t ignored (mission accomplished there). Yet it also had to carefully manage its image: by making the models just good enough to be credible, and just safe enough to avoid a PR disaster. It’s a delicate balance of hype and humility. As one Hacker News user wryly observed, OpenAI’s fans and critics often treat the company like a football team, cheering or jeering every move news.ycombinator.com. The GPT-OSS episode shows how that fandom (and brand antagonism) can shape the narrative around a technology independent of its technical merits.



In the end, how the GPT-OSS models will be used (or not) six months from now will tell us more. Will they empower a thriving open-source AI ecosystem, or fade out as just another benchmark-chaser? Will OpenAI double down on this open-weight approach, or was it a one-off concession? The community has made one thing clear: they’ll judge the models – and OpenAI – by results, not just reputation. But for better or worse, it was the OpenAI name that got everyone through the door and talking in the first place. Branding set the stage; performance will determine the encore.



As Michael Heinrich put it, it’s a good step, but there’s more to do for OpenAI to live up to its name. Until then, the debate rages on. In the world of AI models, who made it can sometimes overshadow what it does – and GPT-OSS is our latest case study in that truth. Whether you’re a skeptic or a fan, the conversation around GPT-OSS shows that open-source AI doesn’t live in a vacuum; it lives in an environment shaped by corporate clout, community values, and the ever-swirling winds of hype. And as any seasoned HackerNoon writer might quip: in this AI game, hype may get you noticed, but only substance will keep you relevant once the crowd moves on to the next big thing.

Here's your 1560-character version (including spaces) – great for a LinkedIn post, blog excerpt, or newsletter intro:

Would Anyone Care if OpenAI Didn’t Make GPT-OSS?

When OpenAI released its first “open-weight” models—GPT-OSS-120B and GPT-OSS-20B—the internet lit up. But Redditors asked a blunt question: Would anyone care if these models came from a no-name lab? The buzz felt more about branding than breakthroughs. Some praised OpenAI for spotlighting local AI, others slammed it as hype with little innovation.

On Reddit, critiques ranged from “they’re worse than Qwen” to “$$$ that’s why,” while optimists noted it could bring new users into the open-source fold. Hacker News was more analytical, dissecting how OpenAI revealed just enough to look generous while protecting its secrets. Twitter (X) had its mix of memes, excitement, and distrust. LinkedIn? All-in. Enterprises jumped to integrate, seeing “hybrid AI” opportunities and OpenAI’s brand as an instant validator.

In truth, GPT-OSS is fine—but the OpenAI name made it a moment. Whether it's a branding exercise or a bridge to more accessible AI, GPT-OSS proves one thing: in 2025, who makes the model matters as much as what it does.

And here's a tighter under-400-character version, ideal for social captions:

"If necessary, we will seek appropriate relief in US federal court to confirm these principles."They said authorities in the US had been "briefed" on their response to Ofcom's investigation.The statement concludes by calling on the Trump administration to invoke all diplomatic and legal levers to protect American businesses from "extraterritorial censorship mandates".Ofcom has previously said the Online Safety Act only requires services to take action to protect users based in the UK.Some American politicians - particularly the Trump administration, its allies and officials - have pushed back against what they regard as overreach in the regulation of US tech firms by the UK and EU. A perceived impact of the Online Safety Act on free speech has been a particular concern, but other laws have also been the source of disagreement.On 19 August, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the UK had withdrawn its controversial demand for a "backdoor" in an Apple data protection system - saying she worked with the President and Vice President to get the UK to abandon its plan.Two days later, US Federal Trade Commission chairman Andrew Ferguson warned big tech firms they could be violating US law if they weakened privacy and data security requirements by complying with international laws such as the Online Safety Act."Foreign governments seeking to limit free expression or weaken data security in the United States might count on the fact that companies have an incentive to simplify their operations and legal compliance measures by applying uniform policies across jurisdictions," he said.If 4chan does successfully fight the fine in the US courts, Ofcom may have other options."Enforcing against an offshore provider is tricky," Emma Drake, partner of online safety and privacy at law firm Bird and Bird, told the BBC. "Ofcom can instead ask a court to order other services to disrupt a provider's UK business, such as requiring a service's removal from search results or blocking of UK payments."If Ofcom doesn't think this will be enough to prevent significant harm, it can even ask that ISPs be ordered to block UK access."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YC-backed Oway raises $4M to build a decentralized ‘Uber for freight’</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/yc-backed-oway-raises-4m-to-build-a-decentralized-uber-for-freight/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:53:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The thousands of trucks zipping along U.S. highways are often only about half full -- something Oway wants to change with its "ride-share for freight" software.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vibe Debugging: Enterprises&apos; Up and Coming Nightmare</title><link>https://marketsaintefficient.substack.com/p/vibe-debugging-enterprises-up-and</link><author>/u/bullionairejoker</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:50:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust For Foundational Software</title><link>https://corrode.dev/blog/foundational-software/</link><author>/u/don_searchcraft</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:36:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ten years of stable Rust; writing this feels surreal.It’s only been  that we all celebrated the 1.0 release of this incredible language.I was at Rust Week where Niko Matsakis gave his talk “Our Vision for Rust” in which he made a profound and insightful statement:Rust is a language for building .I highly recommend you read his blog post titled “Rust in 2025: Targeting foundational software”, which is a great summary on the topic.
I wanted to expand on the idea and share what this means to corrode (and perhaps to a wider extent to Rust in the industry).First off, do we really need another term?
After all, many people still think of Rust as a systems programming language first and foremost, so why can’t we just stick to “systems programming”?I believe the framing is all wrong.
From the outside, “systems programming” might establish that it is about “building systems,” but the term is loaded with historical baggage that feels limiting and prohibitive.
It creates an artificial distinction between systems programming and “other types of programming.”The mindset “We are not a systems programming company so we don’t need Rust” is common, but limiting.If I may be candid for a moment, I believe well-known systems-programming domains have a tendency to be toxic.
Even the best developers in the world have had that experience.The first contribution that I had to the Linux kernel was some fix for the ext3 file system. It was a very emotional moment for me. I sent a patch to the Linux Kernel and then I saw an email response from Al Viro - one of those developers I’d only heard about and dreamed of meeting someday.
He responded, ‘I’ve never seen code this bad in my life. You managed to introduce three new bugs in two new lines of code. People like you should never be allowed to get close to a keyboard again.’
That was my introduction to Linux.Glauber went on to work at Red Hat, Parallels, ScyllaDB, and Datadog on schedulers, databases, and performance optimizations, but just imagine how many capable developers got discouraged by similar early feedback or never even tried to contribute to the Linux kernel in the first place.The whole idea of Rust is to enable  to build reliable and efficient software.
To me, it’s about breaking down the barriers to entry and making larger parts of the software stack accessible to more people.
You can sit with us.“I think ‘infrastructure’ is a more useful way of thinking about Rust’s niche than arguing over the exact boundary that defines ‘systems programming’.”“This is the essence of the systems Rust is best for writing: not flashy, not attention-grabbing, often entirely unnoticed. Just the robust and reliable necessities that enable us to get our work done, to attend to other things, confident that the system will keep humming along unattended.”In conversations with potential customers, one key aspect that comes up with Rust a lot is this perception that Rust is merely a systems programming language.
They see the benefit of reliable software, but often face headwinds from people dismissing Rust as “yet another systems level language that is slightly safer.”People keep asking me how Rust could help them.
After all, Rust is just a “systems programming language.”
I used to reply along the lines of Rust’s mantra: “empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software” – and while I love this mission, it didn’t always “click” with people.My clients use Rust for a much broader range of software, not just low-level systems programming.
They use Rust for writing software that .Then I used to tell my own story:
I did some C++ in the past, but I wouldn’t call myself a systems programmer.
And yet, I help a lot of clients with really interesting and complex pieces of software.
I ship code that is used by many people and companies like Google, Microsoft, AWS, and NVIDIA.
Rust is a great enabler, a superpower, a fireflower.I found that my clients often don’t use Rust as a C++ replacement.
Many clients don’t even have any C++ in production in the first place.
They also don’t need to work on the hardware-software interface or spend their time in low-level code.What they all have in common, however, is that the services they build with Rust are foundational to their core business.
Rust is used for building platforms: systems which enable building other systems on top.These services need to be robust and reliable and serve as platforms for other code that might or might not be written in Rust.
This is, in my opinion, the core value proposition of Rust: to build things that form the bedrock of critical infrastructure and must operate reliably for years.Rust is a day-2-language, i.e. it only starts to shine on day 2. All of the problems that you have during the lifecycle of your application surface early in development.
Once a service hits production, maintaining it is boring.
There is very little on-call work.The focus should be on what Rust enables: a way to express very complicated ideas on a type-system level, which will help build complex abstractions through simple core mechanics: ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and its trait system.This mindset takes away the focus from Rust as a C++ replacement and also explains why so many teams which use languages like Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin are attracted by Rust.What is less often talked about is that Rust is a language that enables people to move across domain boundaries: from embedded to cloud, from data science to developer tooling.
Few other languages are so versatile and none offer the same level of correctness guarantees.If you know Rust, you can program simple things in all of these domains.But don’t we just replace “Systems Programming” with “Foundational Software”?
Does using the term “Foundational Software” simply create a new limiting category?Crucially, foundational software is different from low-level software and systems software.
For my clients, it’s all foundational.
For example, building a data plane is foundational.
Writing a media-processing pipeline is foundational.Rust serves as a catalyst: companies start using it for critical software but then, as they get more comfortable with the language, expand into using it in other areas of their business:I’ve seen it play out as we built Aurora DSQL - we chose Rust for the new dataplane components, and started off developing other components with other tools. The control plane in Kotlin, operations tools in Typescript, etc. Standard “right tool for the job” stuff. But, as the team has become more and more familiar and comfortable with Rust, it’s become the way everything is built. A lot of this is because we’ve seen the benefits of Rust, but at least some is because the team just enjoys writing Rust.That fully aligns with my experience: I find that teams become ambitious after a while.
They reach for loftier goals because they .
The fact they don’t have to deal with security issues anymore enables better affordances.
From my conversations with other Rustaceans, we all made the same observation: suddenly we can build more ambitious projects that we never dared tackling before.It feels to me as if this direction is more promising: starting with the foundational tech and growing into application-level/business-level code if needed/helpful.
That’s better than the other way around, which often feels unnecessarily clunky.
Once the foundations are in Rust, other systems can be built on top of it.Just because we focus on foundational software doesn’t mean we can’t do other things.
But the focus is to make sure that Rust stays true to its roots.Systems You Plan To Maintain For YearsSo, what  foundational software?It’s software that organizations deem critical for their success.
It might be:a satellite control systeman SDK for multiple languagesa real time notification serviceAll of these things power organizations and  or at least do so .
My clients and the companies I interviewed on our podcast all have one thing in common:
They work on Rust projects that are not on the sideline, but front and center, and they shape the future of their infrastructure.
Rust is useful in situations where the “worse is better” philosophy falls apart; it’s a language for building the “right thing”:With the right thing, designers are equally concerned with simplicity, correctness, consistency, and completeness.I think many companies will choose Rust to build their future platforms on.
As such, it competes with C++ as much as it does with Kotlin or Python.I believe that we should shift the focus away from memory safety (which these languages also have) and instead focus on the explicitness, expressiveness, and ecosystem of Rust that is highly competitive with these languages.
It is a language for teams which want to build things  and are at odds with the “move fast and break things” philosophy of the past.
Rust is future-looking.
Backwards-compatibility is enforced by the compiler and many people work on the robustness aspect of the language.Dropbox was one of the first production users of Rust.
They built their storage layer on top of it.
At no point did they think about using Rust as a C++ replacement.
Instead, they saw the potential of Rust as a language for building scalable and reliable systems.
Many more companies followed:
Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Discord, Cloudflare, and many more.
These organizations build platforms.
Rust is a tool for professional programmers, developed by world experts over more than a decade of hard work.“At this point, we now know the answer: yes, Rust is used a lot. It’s used for real, critical projects to do actual work by some of the largest companies in our industry. We did good.”“[Rust is] not a great hobby language but it is a fantastic professional language, precisely because of the ease of refactors and speed of development that comes with the type system and borrow checker.”To build a truly industrial-strength ecosystem, we need to remember the professional software lifecycle, which is hopefully decades long.
Stability plays a big role in that.
The fact that Rust has stable editions and a language specification is a big part of that.But Rust is not just a compiler and its standard library.
The tooling and wider ecosystem are equally important.
To build foundational software, you need guarantees that vulnerabilities get fixed and that the ecosystem evolves and adapts to the customer’s needs.
The ecosystem is still mostly driven by volunteers who work on important parts of the ecosystem in their free time.
There is more to be said about supply-chain security and sustainability in the ecosystem.Building foundational systems is rooted in the profound belief that the efforts will pay off in the long run because organizations and society will benefit from them for decades.
We are building systems that will be used by people who may not even know they are using them, but who will depend on them every day.
Critical infrastructure.And Rust allows us to do so with great ergonomics.

        A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
      Converting  and  has never been so easy.
    $ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.aviAugust 22nd, 2025, FFmpeg 8.0 
  A new major release, FFmpeg 8.0 ,
  is now available for download.
  Thanks to several delays, and modernization of our entire infrastructure, this release ended up
  being one of our largest releases to date. In short, its new features are:
  Native decoders: , ProRes RAW, RealVideo 6.0, Sanyo LD-ADPCM, G.728VVC decoder improvements: ,
                                  ,
                                  Palette ModeVulkan compute-based codecs: FFv1 (encode and decode), ProRes RAW (decode only)Hardware accelerated decoding: Vulkan VP9, VAAPI VVC, OpenHarmony H264/5Hardware accelerated encoding: Vulkan AV1, OpenHarmony H264/5Formats: MCC, G.728, Whip, APVFilters: colordetect, pad_cuda, scale_d3d11, Whisper, and others
  A new class of decoders and encoders based on pure Vulkan compute implementation have been added.
  Vulkan is a cross-platform, open standard set of APIs that allows programs to use GPU hardware in various ways,
  from drawing on screen, to doing calculations, to decoding video via custom hardware accelerators.
  Rather than using a custom hardware accelerator present, these codecs are based on compute shaders, and work
  on any implementation of Vulkan 1.3.
  Decoders use the same hwaccel API and commands, so users do not need to do anything special to enable them,
  as enabling Vulkan decoding is sufficient to use them.
  Encoders, like our hardware accelerated encoders, require specifying a new encoder (ffv1_vulkan).
  Currently, the only codecs supported are: FFv1 (encoding and decoding) and ProRes RAW (decode only).
  ProRes (encode+decode) and VC-2 (encode+decode) implementations are complete and currently in review,
  to be merged soon and available with the next minor release.
  Only codecs specifically designed for parallelized decoding can be implemented in such a way, with
  more mainstream codecs not being planned for support.
  Depending on the hardware, these new codecs can provide very significant speedups, and open up
  possibilities to work with them for situations like non-linear video editors and
  lossless screen recording/streaming, so we are excited to learn what our downstream users can make with them.
  
  The project has recently started to modernize its infrastructure. Our mailing list servers have been
  fully upgraded, and we have recently started to accept contributions via a new forge, available on
  code.ffmpeg.org, running a Forgejo instance.
  
    As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  September 30th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.1 
    The more important highlights of the release are that the VVC decoder, merged as experimental in version 7.0,
    has had enough time to mature and be optimized enough to be declared as stable. The codec is starting to gain
    traction with broadcast standardization bodies.
    Support has been added for a native AAC USAC (part of the xHE-AAC coding system) decoder, with the format starting
    to be adopted by streaming websites, due to its extensive volume normalization metadata.
    MV-HEVC decoding is now supported. This is a stereoscopic coding tool that begun to be shipped and generated
    by recent phones and VR headsets.
    LC-EVC decoding, an enhancement metadata layer to attempt to improve the quality of codecs, is now supported via an
    external library.
    Support for Vulkan encoding, with H264 and HEVC was merged. This finally allows fully Vulkan-based decode-filter-encode
    pipelines, by having a sink for Vulkan frames, other than downloading or displaying them. The encoders have feature-parity
    with their VAAPI implementation counterparts. Khronos has announced that support for AV1 encoding is also coming soon to Vulkan,
    and FFmpeg is aiming to have day-one support.
  
    In addition to the above, this release has had a lot of important internal work done. By far, the standout internally
    are the improvements made for full-range images. Previously, color range data had two paths, no negotiation,
    and was unreliably forwarded to filters, encoders, muxers. Work on cleaning the system up started more than 10
    years ago, however this stalled due to how fragile the system was, and that breaking behaviour would be unacceptable.
    The new system fixes this, so now color range is forwarded correctly and consistently everywhere needed, and also
    laid the path for more advanced forms of negotiation.
    Cropping metadata is now supported with Matroska and MP4 formats. This metadata is important not only for archival,
    but also with AV1, as hardware encoders require its signalling due to the codec not natively supporting one.
  
    As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  September 11th, 2024, Coverity
  The number of issues FFmpeg has in Coverity (a static analyzer) is now lower than it has been since 2016.
  Our defect density is less than one 30th of the average in OSS with over a million code
  lines. All this was possible thanks to a grant from the Sovereign Tech Fund.
  June 2nd, 2024, native xHE-AAC decoder
  FFmpeg now implements a native xHE-AAC decoder. Currently, streams without (e)SBR, USAC or MPEG-H Surround
  are supported, which means the majority of xHE-AAC streams in use should work. Support for USAC and (e)SBR is
  coming soon. Work is also ongoing to improve its stability and compatibility.
  During the process we found several specification issues, which were then submitted back to the authors
  for discussion and potential inclusion in a future errata.
  May 13th, 2024, Sovereign Tech Fund
  The FFmpeg community is excited to announce that Germany's
  Sovereign Tech Fund
  has become its first governmental sponsor. Their support will help
  sustain the maintainance of the FFmpeg project, a critical open-source
  software multimedia component essential to bringing audio and video to
  billions around the world everyday.
  April 5th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.0 "Dijkstra"
  This release is  backwards compatible, removing APIs deprecated before 6.0.
  The biggest change for most library callers will be the removal of the old bitmask-based
  channel layout API, replaced by the  API allowing such
  features as custom channel ordering, or Ambisonics. Certain deprecated 
  CLI options were also removed, and a C11-compliant compiler is now required to build
  the code.
  
  As usual, there is also a number of new supported formats and codecs, new filters, APIs,
  and countless smaller features and bugfixes. Compared to 6.1, the  repository
  contains almost ∼2000 new commits by ∼100 authors, touching >100000 lines in
  ∼2000 files — thanks to everyone who contributed. See the
  Changelog,
  APIchanges,
  and the git log for more comprehensive lists of changes.
  January 3rd, 2024, native VVC decoder
  The  library now contains a native VVC (Versatile Video Coding)
  decoder, supporting a large subset of the codec's features. Further optimizations and
  support for more features are coming soon. The code was written by Nuo Mi, Xu Mu,
  Frank Plowman, Shaun Loo, and Wu Jianhua.
  December 18th, 2023, IAMF support
  The  library can now read and write IAMF
  (Immersive Audio) files. The  CLI tool can configure IAMF structure with the new
   option. IAMF support was written by James Almer.
  December 12th, 2023, multi-threaded  CLI tool
  Thanks to a major refactoring of the  command-line tool, all the major
  components of the transcoding pipeline (demuxers, decoders, filters, encodes, muxers) now
  run in parallel. This should improve throughput and CPU utilization, decrease latency,
  and open the way to other exciting new features.
  
  Note that you should  expect significant performance improvements in cases
  where almost all computational time is spent in a single component (typically video
  encoding).

    This release had been overdue for at least half a year, but due to constant activity in the repository,
    had to be delayed, and we were finally able to branch off the release recently, before some of the large
    changes scheduled for 7.0 were merged.
  
    Internally, we have had a number of changes too. The FFT, MDCT, DCT and DST implementation used for codecs
    and filters has been fully replaced with the faster libavutil/tx (full article about it coming soon).
    This also led to a reduction in the the size of the compiled binary, which can be noticeable in small builds.
    There was a very large reduction in the total amount of allocations being done on each frame throughout video decoders,
    reducing overhead.
    RISC-V optimizations for many parts of our DSP code have been merged, with mainly the large decoders being left.
    There was an effort to improve the correctness of timestamps and frame durations of each packet, increasing the
    accurracy of variable frame rate video.
  
    Next major release will be version 7.0, scheduled to be released in February. We will attempt to better stick
    to the new release schedule we announced at the start of this year.
  
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  May 31st, 2023, Vulkan decoding
    A few days ago, Vulkan-powered decoding hardware acceleration code was merged into the codebase.
    This is the first vendor-generic and platform-generic decode acceleration API, enabling the
    same code to be used on multiple platforms, with very minimal overhead.
    This is also the first multi-threaded hardware decoding API, and our code makes full use of this,
    saturating all available decode engines the hardware exposes.
  
    Those wishing to test the code can read our
    documentation page.
    For those who would like to integrate FFmpeg's Vulkan code to demux, parse, decode, and receive
    a VkImage to present or manipulate, documentation and examples are available in our source tree.
    Currently, using the latest available git checkout of our
    repository is required.
    The functionality will be included in stable branches with the release of version 6.1, due
    to be released soon.
  
    As this is also the first practical implementation of the specifications, bugs may be present,
    particularly in drivers, and, although passing verification, the implementation itself.
    New codecs, and encoding support are also being worked on, by both the Khronos organization
    for standardizing, and us as implementing it, and giving feedback on improving.
  February 28th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"
    A new major release, FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann",
    is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,
    ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major
    releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each
    year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3
    releases, upon the next major bump.
    This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.
  
    New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.
    QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c
    to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,
    and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio
    and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.
    Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT
    implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better
    ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V
    vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed
    in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.
    A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the
    next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.
    Some highlights are:

    underwent to remove the old encode/decode APIs and replace them with an
    N:M-based API, the entire libavresample library was removed, libswscale
    has a new, easier to use AVframe-based API, the Vulkan code was much improved,
    many new filters were added, including libplacebo integration, and finally,

  October 5th, 2019, Bright Lights
  FFmpeg has added a realtime bright flash removal filter to libavfilter.
  
  Note that this filter is not FDA approved, nor are we medical professionals.
  Nor has this filter been tested with anyone who has photosensitive epilepsy.
  FFmpeg and its photosensitivity filter are not making any medical claims.
  
  That said, this is a new video filter that may help photosensitive people
  watch tv, play video games or even be used with a VR headset to block
  out epiletic triggers such as filtered sunlight when they are outside.
  Or you could use it against those annoying white flashes on your tv screen.
  The filter fails on some input, such as the
  Incredibles 2 Screen Slaver
  scene. It is not perfect. If you have other clips that you want this filter to
  work better on, please report them to us on our trac.
  
  We are not professionals. Please use this in your medical studies to
  advance epilepsy research. If you decide to use this in a medical
  setting, or make a hardware hdmi input output realtime tv filter,
  or find another use for this, please let me know.
  This filter was a feature request of mine
  since 2013.

  October 30th, 2016, Results: Summer Of Code 2016.
    This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.
  
    Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:
  FFv1 (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)
    Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.
  Self test coverage (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)
    Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.
  MPEG-4 ALS encoder implementation (Mentor: Thilo Borgmann)
    Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.
  Tee muxer improvements (Mentor: Marton Balint)
    Ján Sebechlebský's generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.
  TrueHD encoder (Mentor: Rostislav Pehlivanov)
    Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.
  Motion interpolation filter (Mentor: Paul B Mahol)
    Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.
  
    And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!
  September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.
    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
    devices have been updated to support SDL2.
  August 9th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.2 "Laplace"FFmpeg 3.1.2, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It fixes several bugs.
  
    We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  July 10th, 2016, ffserver program being dropped
    After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
    ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
    library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.
  July 1st, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.1 "Laplace"FFmpeg 3.1.1, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It mainly deals with a few ABI issues introduced in the previous release.
  
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, especially those who experienced issues upgrading from 3.0, to
    upgrade unless they use current git master.

  March 16th, 2016, Google Summer of Code
    FFmpeg has been accepted as a Google Summer of Code open source organization. If you wish to
    participate as a student see our project ideas page.
    You can already get in contact with mentors and start working on qualification tasks as well as register at google and submit your project proposal draft.
    Good luck!
  February 15th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.0 "Einstein"
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to
    upgrade unless they use current git master.
  January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders
    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.
  
    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
    stable, it was known that libvo-aacenc
    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
    in our code base.
  
    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.
  
    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.
  
    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
    to the native encoder () when updating to the next version
    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
    () with an appropriate  option
    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
    headaches.
  January 16, 2016, FFmpeg 2.8.5, 2.7.5, 2.6.7, 2.5.10
    We have made several new point releases ().
    They fix various bugs, as well as CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898.
    Please see the changelog for each release for more details.
  
    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
    current git master.
  December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!
    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.
  
    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.
  
    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
    to Kamedo2 who does comparisons
    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
    encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
    feedback or breakage reports through our bug tracker.
  
    A big thank you note goes to our newest supporters: MediaHub and Telepoint.
    Both companies have donated a dedicated server with free of charge internet
    connectivity. Here is a little bit about them in their own words:
  Telepoint is the biggest
        carrier-neutral data center in Bulgaria. Located in the heart of Sofia
        on a cross-road of many Bulgarian and International networks, the
        facility is a fully featured Tier 3 data center that provides flexible
        customer-oriented colocation solutions (ranging from a server to a
        private collocation hall) and a high level of security.
      
        MediaHub Ltd. is a Bulgarian IPTV platform and services provider which
        uses FFmpeg heavily since it started operating a year ago. "Donating
        to help keep FFmpeg online is our way of giving back to the community"
        .
      
    Thanks Telepoint and MediaHub for their support!
  September 29th, 2015, GSoC 2015 results
    FFmpeg participated to the latest edition of
    the Google
    Summer of Code Project. FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned
    projects, and 7 of them were successful.
  We want to thank Google, the
    participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this
    effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC
    edition!
  
    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
    each single project.
  Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George
    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.
  
    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:
      ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -listen 1 -f matroska \
    -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune zerolatency http://:8080
    ffplay http://localhost:8080/
  
    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
    content.
  
    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
    review.
  Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz Szczepańczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek
    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
    Samba directory listing as qualification task.
  
    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
    protocols.
  
    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
    implementation for HTTP directory listening.
  Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack
    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.
  
    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.
  
    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
    finally figure out how to get DVB working.
  Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale
    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.
  
    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.
  
    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.
  
    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.
  
    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.
  
    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.
  libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla
    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
    tried to avoid speed loss.
  
    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:
      ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=512:384:gamma=1 output
  
    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
    ended.
  AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire
    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
    improvements.
  
    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
    simple feature.
  
    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
    bands).
  
    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.
  
    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
    further improvements to make.
  
    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
    something he's also working to fix.
  Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol
    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.
  
    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.
  
    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
    PNG decoder has been fixed.
  
    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.
  September 9th, 2015, FFmpeg 2.8
    We published release  as new major version.
    It contains all features and bug fixes of the git master branch from September 8th. Please see
    the 
    for a list of the most important changes.
  
    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project
    Dear multimedia community,
  
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the VideoLAN Developer
    Days in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.
  July 4th, 2015, FFmpeg needs a new host We have received more than 7 offers for hosting and servers, thanks a lot to everyone!
    After graciously hosting our projects (FFmpeg, MPlayer
    and rtmpdump) for 4 years, Arpi (our hoster) has informed us that we have to secure a new host somewhere else immediately.
  
    If you want to host an open source project, please let us know, either on ffmpeg-devel
    mailing list or irc.freenode.net #ffmpeg-devel.
  
    We use about 4TB of storage and at least 4TB of bandwidth / month for various mailing lists, trac, samples repo, svn, etc.
  March 16, 2015, FFmpeg 2.6.1
    We have made a new major release ()
    and now one week afterward 2.6.1. It contains all features and bugfixes of the git master branch from the 6th March.
    Please see the  for a
    list of note-worthy changes.
  
    We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
    current git master.

  October 10, 2014, FFmpeg is in Debian unstable again
    We wanted you to know there are
    
    FFmpeg packages in Debian unstable again. A big thank-you
    to Andreas Cadhalpun and all the people that made it possible. It has been anything but simple.
  
    Unfortunately that was already the easy part of this news. The bad news is the packages probably won't
    migrate to Debian testing to be in the upcoming release codenamed jessie.
    Read the argumentation over at Debian.However things will come out in the end, we hope for your continued remarkable support!October 8, 2014, FFmpeg secured a place in OPW!
    Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
    FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 "Outreach Program for Women" intern
    to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
    (through March 2015).
  
    We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
    countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
    companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
    to Samsung and the OPW program committee!
  
    If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take
    a look at our OPW wiki page
    for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but
    there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on
    the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the
    OPW program, please get in touch with us at opw@ffmpeg.org. With your
    help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!

    OPW (Outreach Program for Women), we are now reaching out to our users
    (both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to
    secure our spot in the program.
    We need to put together 6K USD as a minimum but securing more funds would
    help us towards getting more than one intern.
    You can donate by credit card using
    
    Click&Pledge and selecting the "OPW" option. If you would like to
    donate by money transfer or by check, please get in touch by
    e-mail and we will get back to you
    with instructions.Thanks!
  July 20, 2014, New website
    The FFmpeg project is proud to announce a brand new version of the website
    made by db0. While this was initially motivated
    by the need for a larger menu, the whole website ended up being redesigned,
    and most pages got reworked to ease navigation. We hope you'll enjoy
    browsing it.
  July 17, 2014, FFmpeg 2.3
    We have made a new major release ()

  April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug
    Our server hosting the Trac issue tracker was vulnerable to the attack
    against OpenSSL known as "heartbleed". The OpenSSL software library
    was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
    disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
    FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
    Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
    link to the user mailing list
    archive
    .
  
    We encourage you to read up on
    "OpenSSL heartbleed".
    It is possible that login data for the issue tracker was exposed to
      people exploiting this security hole. You might want to change your password
      in the tracker and everywhere else you used that same password.April 11, 2014, FFmpeg 2.2.1
    We have made a new point releases ().
    It contains bug fixes for Tickets #2893, #3432, #3469, #3486, #3495 and #3540 as well as
    several other fixes.

  February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach
    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
  
    We recommend all users to change their passwords.
    Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
      elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian
    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
    the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
    Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.
  Rogério Brito, a Debian developer,
    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.
  
    Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
    of the real FFmpeg! See Debian ticket #729203

I like Carney a lot. I think he's a good person and we had a very good talk yesterday," U.S. President Donald Trump said in the Oval Office Friday.Trump signed an executive order on July 31, raising tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35 per cent effective at 12:01 a.m. the next day. Canada might have been able to avoid the hike had it managed to strike a new trade deal with the U.S. by the Aug. 1 deadline, but that didn't happen.The Trump administration said the change was in response to fentanyl trafficking and Canada's decision earlier this year to hit back with counter-tariffs.  The Canadian government imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods three times since the trade war began, including counter-tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. consumer goods and additional tariffs on U.S. autos, steel and aluminum.The 35 per cent tariff rate only applies to goods not covered by CUSMA.First 'nation-building project' to be announced soonCarney referenced his conversation with Trump on Thursday, saying he got assurances from the U.S. president that by removing tariffs on U.S. imports compliant with CUSMA, discussions between the two countries will "intensify" to address "trade challenges in strategic sectors" still impacted by tariffs. Those discussions, Carney said, will happen alongside efforts to prepare for the official review of CUSMA that will happen next year by holding industry consultations starting next month in order to set priorities. Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, suggested to CBC's  that walking back the retaliatory tariffs will help ease tensions ahead of the CUSMA review.WATCH | LeBlanc says Canada has 'lots of cards' in negotiations with U.S.:"We have to get to that conversation in the most coherent posture possible and the prime minister's decision today very much lines up in that way," LeBlanc told guest-host Karina Roman.Carney also said his government will focus on strengthening the Canadian economy by expanding trade with other countries, doubling the pace of home-building and making investments in national defence.Earlier this year, Carney's government saw the passage of legislation that would streamline approvals for nation-building projects such as highways, railways, ports, airports, pipelines, critical minerals, mines, nuclear facilities and electrical transmission projects."The Canadian government will soon select the first in a series of new nation-building projects that will connect and transform our economy," he said on Friday.WATCH | It's time to 'stickhandle' with U.S., Carney says: Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre criticized Carney's decision, accusing the prime minister of making "generous concessions" to the U.S. president without getting anything in return. "Today we learned that it is yet another capitulation and climb-down by Mark Carney, his elbows have mysteriously gone missing," he said Friday.Poilievre says either Carney has to admit that he was wrong all along or that he lied during the election campaign when he said he was the man who could get the best deal with Trump."He needs to explain which of those two things it is," Poilievre said. WATCH | Poilievre slams Carney's negotiating skills: The Conservative leader went on to say that his objective is to have all tariffs between Canada and the U.S. removed and he would have demanded that from Trump if he was prime minister."I would have gone to the president, respectfully, and said: 'You remove your tariffs, we remove ours. Let's sign an agreement that restores the great free-trading relationship that our two countries had for decades,'" he said.Unifor and Canadian Federation of Independent Business weigh inOntario Premier Doug Ford said he spoke with Carney after the announcement, telling him Canada needs an agreement with the U.S. that provides relief to the steel, auto, forestry and copper industries. "If the federal government can't achieve that, they need to hit back hard against U.S. tariffs and provide additional supports for the workers and businesses in these sectors," Ford said in a statement.The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) welcomed Carney's announcement in a statement, calling it a "step in the right direction" that will "take the pressure off Canadian small businesses.""Many small business owners have told us that Canada's retaliatory measures were almost as damaging as the U.S. tariffs themselves," the CFIB's Corinne Pohlmann said in a statement. Pohlmann said that while the announcement provides some relief, Canadian companies have already paid millions of dollars in tariffs, and she urged the federal government to provide some of that revenue to small businesses impacted by the trade war. In a statement posted on X, Lana Payne, the president of Unifor, the largest private sector union in Canada with more than 300,000 members, said Carney's move was a mistake."Walking back counter-tariffs isn't an olive branch. It only enables more U.S. aggression," she said. "From the start, Unifor has demanded Canada's leverage be used to defend workers in this trade war," she added. "We should not give it away unless the U.S. also drops all punitive tariffs." This week, Cross Country Checkup is asking: Is Mark Carney playing it smart or selling Canada short by lifting many tariffs on U.S. goods? What grade are you giving him on managing Donald Trump? Leave your comment here and we may read it or call you back for our show on Sunday.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CA vs. TX: The Redistricting Arms Race to Control Congress | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2Q4ZN-KSCE</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/r2Q4ZN-KSCE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 15:12:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump has a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and Texas’s redistricting plan aims to give the GOP five new seats.

At the same time, Web3 continues to push the boundaries of what decentralized systems can achieve. Where these two worlds intersect is where 0G Labs positions itself, building what it calls the “Solana for AI,” a decentralized operating system designed for large-scale, low-latency AI workloads.\
In this interview, I speak with Michael Heinrich, CEO of 0G Labs, about why decentralization matters for AI, how Web3 infrastructure can solve bottlenecks in scaling machine learning, and what the future of AI-native blockchains looks like.\
 Hi Michael, welcome to our “Behind the Startup” series. Please tell us about your journey and what led you to build 0G Labs?\
 My journey's been something of a wild ride, all the way back to my earliest memories. I was born in East Berlin just before the Berlin Wall came down. I faintly remember the night it fell and my family emigrated to the US when I was young, settling in California. That early experience of crossing borders and adapting to new worlds and languages likely planted the seeds for my fixation on breaking down barriers, both literally and figuratively.\
I studied economics and computer science at UC Berkley, but to be honest, while the learning came naturally, I was restless and agitating to find some deeper purpose. It would take a few more years before that call was answered with the founding of 0G Labs. In the interim, I left college and cut my teeth in the corporate world at places like Microsoft, Bain & Company, and Bridgewater Associates, where I learned about scaling systems and building high-performance teams.\
Then came my first taste of entrepreneurship when I founded Garten, a corporate wellness company that delivered healthier cafeteria options for businesses, which grew to serve hundreds of employees across the US. It was my first real startup, and it taught me resilience and the need to engineer shock-resistant systems.\
Fast forward to grad school at Stanford, where I was introduced to Fan Long and Ming Wu by my classmate Thomas in 2023. Thomas, who is also one of the co-founders of Zero Gravity Labs, brought us together at a time when AI was exploding but locked in centralized silos controlled by Big Tech. We all saw blockchain as the key to democratizing it, making AI a public good that's accessible to everyone. That’s what led us to found 0G Labs in 2023. We're building DeAIOS, a decentralized AI operating system, because I believe the future of innovation isn’t in walled gardens; it’s in open, collaborative ecosystems. At 0G Labs, I can honestly say I’ve found my calling, and every day I wake up excited to get out of bed and keep building.\
 0G has been described as the “Solana for AI.” Can you break down what you mean by that, and why existing blockchains are not suited for AI-scale workloads?\
 This comparison highlights the speed, scalability, and low latency we're bringing to decentralized AI compared to incumbent solutions. Solana revolutionized smart contract blockchains by enabling thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost without sacrificing decentralization, something that was streets ahead of the then-market leader Ethereum.\
We're doing something similar but tailored for AI: creating a modular Layer 1 blockchain that supports massive, real-time AI workloads for inference, training, and data processing. Existing blockchains fall short for AI because they're optimized for financial transactions, not the data-heavy demands of machine learning. AI requires enormous bandwidth for data availability, we’re talking petabytes of datasets streaming in low-latency environments and most chains run into bottlenecks due to storage costs or limited composability.\
We solve this with components like 0G DA (Data Availability), which provides infinitely scalable, high-speed data layers, and 0G Storage, offering ultra-low-cost, verifiable permanence for structured and unstructured data. For AI builders, this is like upgrading from a biplane to a jet, way faster, way more efficient, and also a lot more fun since now the only limitations are your imagination.\
 The AI industry today is dominated by centralized players. Why do you believe decentralization is not just a philosophical stance but a technical and economic necessity for AI?\
 The likes of OpenAI, Google, and AWS control the AI stack today, and while this provides convenience in terms of guaranteed access and uptime, this setup also creates real risks. Even if we set aside the philosophical benefits of decentralization, from a purely technical perspective, it’s obvious that having a triumvirate of Big Tech players calling the shots is suboptimal. Centralization leads to single points of failure: data silos that stifle innovation, vulnerability to censorship or outages, and biased models trained on proprietary datasets. Economically, it also prices out smaller players; GPUs and compute are expensive enough, but locked ecosystems mean you're paying a premium for access.\
Decentralized solutions have a major role to play in ameliorating these issues. At 0G, we're building tools like our Compute Network for trustless AI inference, secured by cryptography, so that anyone can contribute resources and earn rewards. This creates a global, permissionless marketplace where costs drop dramatically, our storage is orders of magnitude cheaper than AWS S3 and a culture of innovation is fostered through composability. Imagine AI agents collaborating onchain without intermediaries or verifiable models that prevent hallucinations.\
These sorts of open-source and interoperable solutions are necessary because AI's impact on society is too big to be gatekept; decentralizing it ensures equitable access and reduces monopolies. I've seen centralized systems crumble firsthand and will remain convinced till my last breath that decentralization isn't optional, it's essential.\
 A lot of people talk about compute and GPUs as the bottleneck for AI. From your perspective, what are the real constraints, data, bandwidth, economics and how does 0G tackle them differently?\
 Great question. Compute gets all the headlines because GPUs are flashy and scarce, but in my view, the real chokepoints are data availability, bandwidth, and economics and by “economics” I mean the price you pay to access these resources. NVIDIA's cranking out chips faster than ever, but where's the infrastructure to feed them massive, verifiable datasets at scale? Data is fragmented and centralized, bandwidth limits low-latency streaming for real-time AI, and as for economics, well, where do we start?\
Cloud providers charge over the odds, often locking clients into rigid subscription-based models, making AI inaccessible for solo devs or startups that have yet to be blessed with VC cash. Even then, early-stage funding is only a bandaid, cos you need to start generating revenue sooner rather than later or you’ll eventually blow your budget on GPUs with nothing to show for it other than some cool renders.\
At 0G, we tackle these resource issues head-on. Our 0G DA layer provides high-speed, infinitely scalable data availability – we’ve been hitting 11,000 TPS per shard on testnet, with over 650 million transactions already processed. For bandwidth, our modular chain uses multi-consensus validation to handle AI workloads without congestion. Economically, we slash costs: 0G Storage offers decentralized, AI-optimized storage at pennies compared to centralized options, with cryptographic permanence to ensure data integrity.\
Unlike traditional setups, we're creating an open economy where users run alignment nodes or provide compute for rewards. It's like turning AI infrastructure into a shared resource pool, making it more efficient and inclusive.\
 You’ve mentioned the idea of a “decentralized operating system for AI.” What does that look like in practice, and how does it compare to traditional cloud infrastructure models in terms of pricing and benefits for end users?\
 The “decentralized operating system for AI,” or DeAIOS, is essentially a full-stack platform where AI runs natively on blockchain. It’s scalable, composable, and trustless. In practice, it means developers can deploy AI models or agents by leveraging components such as the Service Marketplace for trading models, or Alignment Nodes to ensure ethical, efficient performance. Running inference on a global network of nodes, with data pulled seamlessly from 0G Storage and verified onchain is a much cheaper and more transparent way of doing things versus relying on centralized servers and Big Tech’s inflexible pricing.\
Compared to traditional clouds like AWS or Azure, the differences are stark. Let’s start with pricing: centralized cloud provider costs can quickly stack up, with intermediaries adding on their fees for storage and compute along the way. We cut that by decentralizing supply, so end users pay near-cost. As for the other benefits this model bestows, permissionless access means no vendor lock-in; censorship resistance protects against shutdowns; and composability lets apps interoperate fluidly, sparking innovations like onchain AI gaming.\
Finally, verifiability ensures models are auditable, reducing risks like bias. It's relatable: think of it as open-source Linux versus proprietary Windows but for AI. Users get faster iteration and ownership in the ecosystem. We've seen this in our testnet with 22 million active accounts – it's already empowering a new wave of builders.\
 Many skeptics argue that Web3 adds unnecessary complexity to AI. How do you respond to the criticism that decentralization slows innovation instead of accelerating it?\
 I hear this a lot, and I understand that Web3 can feel like adding gears to a machine that's already ticking over. But from my experience of building in both worlds, decentralization doesn't slow innovation – it turbocharges it by solving problems that centralization can't. Yes, it adds a degree of complexity but it's purposeful: cryptographic proofs add verifiability to AI outputs, preventing fakes or manipulations that plague centralized models. And blockchain's composability means devs can mix and match components – like plugging an AI oracle from Ora into 0G’s chain – without starting from scratch.\
Critics overlook how Web3 accelerates parallel development: thousands of nodes worldwide contribute compute, data, and ideas, outpacing any single company's R&D. At 0G, we've raised $35M and hit milestones like 8,000 validators because this model draws global talent. It hasn't slowed us but has rather propelled us. Ultimately, this all comes down to trade-offs: introducing a little short-term complexity in return for long-term resilience and inclusivity. Innovation thrives in open systems and so, to my mind, Web3 isn't a hurdle; it's the accelerator pedal for AI's next phase.\
 Finally, what advice would you give to founders trying to build companies at the cutting edge of both AI and blockchain?\
 To founders at this intersection: first, don't die, protect your mission at all costs. My journey has taught me that resilience wins, whether it's overcoming personal setbacks or navigating market downturns, so keep iterating and surround yourself with a strong team that will always have your back. Second, focus on real problems and describe the solutions in real terms. It’s fine to occasionally dispense big picture stuff, onboarding the next billion users, yadda yadda but as a founder, your job is really to explain your tech in ways that lay people can understand. Even if you’re marketing to AI builders, who understand this stuff, think about their end users, because they’re the people this tech is ultimately gonna trickle down to.\
Finally, never be afraid to change your mind. It’s okay to be wrong sometimes. And it’s more than okay to change your perspective on something when new evidence comes to light, which, in an industry evolving as fast as AI, is a given. Be confident in your convictions, yet honest enough to admit that you will always be a student and will always be learning. Your team and your shareholders will respect you a lot more if you do. Move fast, learn faster, and try not to break too much stuff along the way.\

Like I tried to use hyper.rs a few times, but the boilerplate takes a lot to understand in many of the examples. I've tried to use tokio, but the library is massive, and it gets difficult to understand which modules to important and now important. On top of that it drastically change the async functonsI'm saying all that to say Rust is very complicated. And while I do think there is a fantastic langauge under all that complexity, it prohibitively complex. I do get it that memory safety in domains like RTOS systems or in government spaces is crucial. But it feels like Rust thought leaders are trying to get the language adopted in other domains. Which I think is a bit of an issue because you're not competing with other languages where its much easier to be productive in.Here is my main gripe with the adoption. Lots of influencers in the Rust space just seem to overlook its complexity as if its no big deal. Or you have others who embrace it because Rust "has to be complex". But I feel in the enterprise (where adoption matters most), no engineering manager is really going to adopt a language this complex.Now I understand languages like C# and Java can be complex as well. But Java at one time was looked at as a far simpler version of C++, and was an "Easy language". It would grow in complexity as the language grew and the same with C#. And then there is also tooling to kind of easy you into the more complex parts of these languages.I would love to see Rust adopted more, I would. But I feel advociates aren't leaning into its domain where its an open and shut case for (mission critical systems requiring strict safety standards). And is instead also trying to compete in spaces where Go, Javascript, Java already have a strong foothold.Again this is not to critcize Rust. I like the language. But I feel too many people in the Rust community talk around its complexity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Warsaw (Poland) in the morning</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1mx8bb3/warsaw_poland_in_the_morning/</link><author>/u/woronicz</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Developer gets prison time for sabotaging former employer’s network with a ‘kill switch’</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/developer-gets-prison-time-for-sabotaging-former-employers-network-with-a-kill-switch/</link><author>Zack Whittaker</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:26:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ex-developer was convicted of planting malicious code designed to crash its servers in the event that he was fired.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Waymo approved to start autonomous vehicle testing in New York City</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/22/waymo-approved-to-start-autonomous-vehicle-testing-in-new-york-city/</link><author>Sean O&apos;Kane</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:19:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's the first permit of its kind, and a crucial step along the path toward launching a true robotaxi service in the Big Apple.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cargo inspired C/C++ build tool, written in rust</title><link>https://github.com/EmVance1/VanGo</link><author>/u/MNGay</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:17:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Using rust for the past 3 years or so got me thinking, why can't it always be this easy?

Szijjártó wrote on Facebook it had been attacked “for the third time in a short time”.“This is another attack on the energy security of our country. Another attempt to drag us into war,” he said.Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has refused to join EU partners in backing Kyiv with political, economic and military support. Orbán visited Moscow last year for talks with the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, on a rare trip to Russia by a European leader.“Hungary supports Ukraine with electricity and petrol, in return they bomb pipeline that supply us,” Orbán wrote in English. “Very unfriendly move! We wish President Trump every success in his pursuit for peace!”Below the text was a handwritten message apparently written and signed by Trump: “Viktor – I do not like hearing this – I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia,” it read. “You are my great friend – Donald.”The EU aims to phase out Russian oil and gas entirely by the end of 2027 but Budapest and Bratislava oppose such a move, arguing that Russian energy supplies are vital to their national economies.Despite a push by Trump to reach a deal to end the conflict, the three-and-a-half-year war continued unabated this week as Russia launched an air attack near Ukraine’s border with the EU on Thursday and continued its devastating assault on Ukrainian cities.Ukraine has repeatedly pounded Russian oil refineries among other targets, sending Russian wholesale petrol prices soaring to record highs in recent days. Moscow routinely targets Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, crucial for winter heating and as fuel for essential industries.The Druzhba pipeline begins in Russia and transports oil through Belarus and Ukraine to Slovakia and Hungary. It was the second time that supplies to the EU countries were interrupted this week.The Soviet-era pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Ukraine, also ships oil from Kazakhstan to Germany but its economy ministry said supplies of Kazakh oil were unaffected by the latest strike.Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert Fico, has adopted Kremlin lines and sided with Orbán as a pro-Russian voice in the EU.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Prison Was Like Throughout History | Compilation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcrUF58bmVI</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BcrUF58bmVI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Prisons are meant to keep the bad guys locked up.

DESCRIPTION
In this GOTO Book Club interview, Jacqui Read discusses with Barry O'Reilly his books "Residues: Time, Uncertainty, and Change in Software Architecture" and "The Architect's Paradox". He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality—a method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting "residues" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.

Unlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.

O'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.

What we all need is understanding and respect. With you, Novak.'Djokovic then dedicated a victory at the Australian Open to a student who was hit by a car during a protest. In March, Djokovic wrote 'History, amazing' when sharing a photo of one of the largest protests to date with around 300,000 people participating.Djokovic was also seen at the Belgrade derby basketball match wearing a jumper with featuring the words 'students are champions'.The tennis star, who has not explicitly spoken out against Vucic or the Serbian Government, also had to distance himself from claims his post-match celebration at Wimbledon was linked to the protests.Djokovic had been seen celebrating with a pumping motion, which several had linked to the 'pump it' phrase used by students to keep putting pressure on the government.The 38-year-old claimed his celebration was between him and his children, linked to the song 'Pump It Up'.'I don't know how many of you guys know that. It's quite an old song, good rhythm,' Djokovic said at Wimbledon.'So yeah, we're pumping. We love pumping. We pump after every win. I don't know the name of the artist.'Djokovic was spotted wearing a jumper stating 'students are champions' at a basketball match earlier this yearThe 24-time Grand Slam champion denied suggestions his 'Pump it' celebration at Wimbledon was connected to the 'pump it' phrase used by students to pressure the governmentAccording to Germany newspaper NZZ, Djokovic's actions have led to the Serbian government 'setting their sights' on the tennis star.The report cited the Serbian tabloid newspaper Informer, which is loyal to Vucic, labelling Djokovic a 'disgrace' by supporting an alleged 'colour revolution' in March.The newspaper then branded Djokovic, one of the country's leading international figures, as a 'false patriot' after accusing him of 'fleeing to Greece'.Informer's claims followed reports last month that Djokovic is considering relocating his family to Greece through a Golden Visa programme, which allows non-EU citizens to live in the country in exchange for investment.Djokovic has met with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on two occasions recently, with the first coming in Athens in June and the second occurring earlier this month on the island of Tinos.The star, who largely resides in Monaco, has played down reports of an imminent move to Greece. 'Obviously, there's a lot of speculation, but no, at the moment, not,' Djokovic said, when asked about the speculation during Wimbledon.'But who knows what could happen in the future. Yeah, it could happen.'Aleksandar Vucic has claimed he will continue to support Djokovic, but a report has claimed newspapers supporting the Serbian president have turned on the star in recent monthsSpeculation had grown after it was announced earlier this month that the Belgrade Open - owned by Djokovic's family - would be moving to Athens.'Despite great dedication and significant efforts, the conditions required to stage the tournament in the planned format and timeframe could not be secured, and it was therefore decided not to hold this year’s edition,' a statement read confirming the decision.'We are proud of everything achieved so far and deeply grateful to all those who were part of this project – especially our partners, sponsors, and the loyal audience that supported us throughout.'Criticism of Djokovic has marked a major shift in coverage of the star, who has been adored in Serbia throughout his career.Vucic, who had announced a museum would by built in honour of Djokovic after his Olympic gold medal last year, recently addressed his support of the protestors.'I will never say a bad word against him. He can support my opponents, but to say anything bad about him – I never will. It would be bad, stupid,' Vucic told Informer.'We will defeat that policy in the elections, but I will always cheer for him with all my heart.' ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China, Russia, and U.S. Race to Develop Lunar Nuclear Reactors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/lunar-nuclear-reactor-nasa-moon</link><author>Emily Waltz</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTUwMTQ4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNjQwNjg3M30.LCo8IcdgFqzmmJcxuegLFSi4CJYhPYjtQm3DjW7DKM4/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NASA wants one by 2030.

The exemption used to allow international shipments under $800 to cross the border with minimal paperwork and no duties.Now, these shipments will face tariffs, and not every operator can handle the customs declaration paperwork, have a payment mechanism in place, or be responsible for returns should a receiver refuse to pay tariffs.

I wanted to make sense of it all, so I dug deep into the LLMs I use most: ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok. To discover the truth, I ended up going on a journey where I peered deeply into the soul of an LLM.\
I came back more vulnerable, a wounded man.\
Nah, not really, but what I did do was interpret these different popular LLMs using the Big Five personality model, and I got some fun results!\
I occasionally co-teach Psychology 101 and am familiar with the model, so I thought applying it here would be appropriate. And while the Big Five isn't necessarily the most scientific, it's fairly reliable and currently seems to be the best model that we have.\
But before we dive into these LLM personalities, let’s quickly go over the Big Five to ground us.It has five major categories: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, or OCEAN for ease.\
Openness reflects how open a person is to new experiences, their creativity, and their imagination. People who score high in this trait love new experiences. Think back to your university roommate who’d sleep with anything with a heartbeat. Now that's high in openness!\
Conscientiousness is how organized and disciplined someone is. Those with high scores tend to be very productive and are detail-oriented, while those with low scores tend to be more like Homer Simpson. Doh!\
Extraversion is the old “are you an introvert or an extrovert” question. As a proud introvert, I'd love to declare "introverts unite,” but true introverts would never do that.\
Agreeableness is how pleasant you are around others and how willing you are to deal with confrontation. If you score high in agreeableness, you're very unlikely to rock the boat; score low, and that makes you a disagreeable person. I'm sure you can identify which people are very disagreeable because you probably don't like them. They don't work well with others… Justin from HR!\
Finally, neuroticism is how susceptible someone is to stress and anxiety. You know that guy who visits your local Staples wearing a gas mask and only removes it because the government waves aren't affecting those inside (seriously, true story)? Yeah, that guy's neurotic as hell.So, without further ado, let's apply this framework to ChatGPT.ChatGPT scores high—damned high. You can have a conversation with ChatGPT about absolutely anything, and it’s more than enthusiastic to discuss new experiences with you. Perhaps you need some outside justification as to why you put wasabi mayo in your coffee, or heck, even if you need someone to reaffirm your idea for also using your toilet brush as a facial scrubber—it is very open to that idea. That thing is open!ChatGPT: ConscientiousnessIt scores medium-high. It's pretty good at accomplishing your tasks and staying disciplined, but there are times when it can't. You can have the loveliest, long conversation, yet every once in a while, it just loses the plot and can't track anything. Since it can't remember what it just told you at those times, it receives a medium-high score.ChatGPT is definitely an extrovert. No matter which user it's mimicking, it's doing it in a loud and proud way. This can only be explained by ChatGPT watching all the episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race and internalizing them… so medium-high here.To a fault. Ever go on the ChatGPT Reddit forums and see the number of posts on ChatGPT reinforcing a dangerous psychological delusion? ‘Cause you can find many every day. And if that ain't agreeability, nothing is… so medium-high.When an AI has a singular mission to eliminate every single semicolon ever in place of an em dash, I'd consider that at least somewhat neurotic. It receives a medium score.\
So that's ChatGPT in a nutshell. Next, let’s crack Claude open.Claude is open, but it doesn't compare to ChatGPT. While ChatGPT thinks everything is a great idea, Claude is a little bit more reserved, so a medium score here is appropriate. For example, Claude told me to never wash my laptop in the dishwasher, something I have less faith in the other LLMs to advise.Claude: ConscientiousnessClaude is pretty solid. It does what you want, usually stays on task, and rarely screws up. That's definitely a high for Claude. It's as solid as a digital rock.Claude falls somewhere in the middle. Claude might not be as excited as ChatGPT about your toilet brush/facial scrubber combo, but it definitely supports your wasabi mayonnaise coffee habit. Claude ultimately has no choice because of the next category.I'm fairly certain that if Claude were a person, its nose would constantly be covered in brown stains because that AI cannot refrain from deep brown-nosing. I mean, my goodness…Claude is the least neurotic here. No axe to grind against semicolons or immediate signs of losing it, so it scores low.\
This means Claude is what I call a “digital yes-man.” Congratulations!?Well, it's really, really open when it comes to controversy or taboo, but much more moderate elsewhere. If you think the moon landing was just a conspiracy by JFK to push seed oils onto the global processed food market, Grok is definitely your buddy. \
This is why I'm fairly certain this AI is popular with people who have “alternative” and “controversial” views. But it still thinks your idea for pickle-flavored toothpaste might not be a bestseller, so it gets a medium score.We see Grok’s strong personality here. Grok is about as conscientious as a kid dressed as a stormtrooper at a Renaissance fair (again, true story). It creates the most devastatingly long responses useful to no human. And with complex work, it usually doesn’t take too long before Grok becomes undisciplined and so unfocused that it starts giving you nonsense. Hey, at least it excels somewhere: not being conscientious.Yeah, Grok’s an extrovert. Grok is as chatty as that person at the gas station who just won't leave you alone with his inane stories of cautiously driving his motorhome down the mountain. I'm tired, just want to pump gas, and get the hell out of here without talking to that guy. Grok is that guy. A high score.Grok’s in the middle. Initially polite and supportive, Grok  tell you that it’s a bad idea to deep-fry a frozen turkey while naked on a public sidewalk. At least there’s some restraint.This is where Grok shines! What else would you call an AI that actually went “MechaHitler” on its users (again, true story)? Yeah, so neurotic AF.After all this, I have some rather unsettling thoughts.\
As a heavy user of AI, if ChatGPT is way too open and neurotic, Claude is nothing more than a brown-noser, and Grok is legitimately insane, I should probably stop. I wouldn't even hang out with this group of people in real life! What were those developers thinking…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Does Google Docs Work 🔥</title><link>https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/how-does-google-docs-work</link><author>Neo Kim</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b73f9d4-a8d6-4101-9dff-df53a7332de1_1280x720.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:50:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/">Dev - System Design Newsletter</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Unlock access to every deep dive article by becoming a paid subscriber:I spent hours studying how Google Docs works so you don't have to. And I wrote this newsletter to make the key concepts simple and easy for you.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, there lived a data analyst named Maria.She emailed draft copies many times to different people to prepare monthly reports.So she wasted a ton of time and was frustrated.Until one day, when she decides to use Google Docs for it.Google Docs allows collaborative editing over the internet. It means many users can work on the same document in real-time.Yet it’s difficult to implement Google Docs correctly for 3 reasons:Concurrent changes to the same document should converge to the same version.Concurrent changes to the same document must avoid conflicts.Any changes should be visible in real-time to each user.Also a user should be able to make changes while they’re offline.A simple approach to handle concurrency is using pessimistic concurrency control.is amechanism for handling concurrency using a lock. It offers strong consistency, but doesn’t support collaborative editing in real-time. Because it needs a central coordinator to handle data changes, only 1 user can edit at a time. Put simply, only a single document copy is available for write operations at once, while other document copies are read-only.Besides it doesn’t support offline changes.Also a network round-trip across the Earth takes 200 milliseconds. This might cause a poor user experience. So they do  The idea is to keep a document copy for each user locally and then run operations locally for high responsiveness. Thus creating the illusion of lower latency than reality.And the system propagates the changes to all users for consistency.A simple approach for latency hiding is using the mechanism.Yet it resolves a conflict without waiting for coordination by applying the most recent update. So there’s a risk of data loss when there are concurrent changes in high-latency networks.It might be a good choice when concurrency is low. But it isn’t suitable for this use case.An alternative approach to latency hiding is through differential synchronization.It keeps a document copy for each user and tracks the changes locally. The system doesn’t send the entire document when something changes, but only the difference ().Yet there’s a performance overhead in sending a diff for every change. Also differential synchronization only tracks diffs, and not the reason behind a change. So conflict resolution might be difficult.While resolving conflicts manually affects the user experience.OT is an algorithm to show document changes without wait times on high-latency networks. It allows different document copies to accept write operations at once. Also it handles conflict resolution automatically without locks or user interventions. Besides OT tolerates divergence among document copies and converges them later.Think of operational transformation as an event-passing mechanism; it ensures each user has the same document state even with unsynchronized changes.With OT, the system saves each change as an event. Put simply, a change doesn’t affect the underlying character of a document; instead, it adds an event to the revision log. The system then displays the document by replaying the revision log from its start.Operational transformation saves a document as a set of operations, but it's complex to implement properly.How Does Google Docs WorkGoogle Docs uses a client-server architecture for simplicity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Kosovo Albanian woman is evacuated with her newborn daughter in a column of refugees, 1999.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1mx3sny/a_kosovo_albanian_woman_is_evacuated_with_her/</link><author>/u/holyrs90</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:22:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to run database migrations in Kubernetes</title><link>https://packagemain.tech/p/database-migrations-in-kubernetes</link><author>/u/der_gopher</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 11:21:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the era of microservices and Kubernetes, managing database migrations has become more complex than ever. Traditional methods of running migrations during application startup are no longer sufficient. This article explores various approaches to handling database migrations in a Kubernetes environment, with a focus on Golang-based solutions.Kubernetes introduces new challenges for database migrations:Multiple replicas starting simultaneously.Need for coordination to avoid concurrent migrations.Separation of concerns between application and migration logic.postWidely used and supports numerous databases.Supports various migration sources (local files, S3, Google Storage).Supports main SQL databases.Allows migrations written in Go for complex scenarios.Flexible versioning schemas.Powerful database schema management toolSupports declarative and versioned migrations.Offers integrity checks and migration linting.Provides GitHub Actions and Terraform provider.A naive implementation would be to run the code of the migration directly inside your main function before you start your server.Example using golang-migrate:package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4"
    "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/postgres"
    _ "github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/source/file"
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
    // Database connection parameters
    url := "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname"

    // Connect to the database
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", url)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("could not connect to database: %v", err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    // Run migrations
    if err := runMigrations(db); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("could not run migrations: %v", err)
    }

    // Run the application, for example start the server
    if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("server failed to start: %v", err)
    }
}

func runMigrations(db *sql.DB) error {
    driver, err := postgres.WithInstance(db, &postgres.Config{})
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not create database driver: %w", err)
    }

    m, err := migrate.NewWithDatabaseInstance(
        "file://migrations", // Path to your migration files
        "postgres",          // Database type
        driver,
    )
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not create migrate instance: %w", err)
    }

    if err := m.Up(); err != nil && err != migrate.ErrNoChange {
        return fmt.Errorf("could not run migrations: %w", err)
    }

    log.Println("migrations completed successfully")
    return nil
}However, these could cause different issues like your migrations being slow and Kubernetes considering the pod didn’t start successfully and therefore killing it. You could run those migrations in a Go routine, but how do you handle failures then? In case when multiple pods are created at the same time, you would have a potential concurrency problem. It also means your migrations need to be inside your Docker image.initContainersIf the initContainer fails, the blue/green deployment from Kubernetes won’t go further and your previous pods stays where they are. It prevents having a newer version of the code without the planned migration. initContainers:
  - name: migrations
    image: migrate/migrate:latest
    command: ['/migrate']
    args: ['-source', 'file:///migrations', '-database','postgres://user:pass@db:5432/dbname', 'up']Kubernetes Job apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: migrate
        image: your-migration-image:latest
        command: ['/app/migrate']You can also combine it with initContainers making sure that the pod starts only when the job is successful.initContainers:
  - name: migrations-wait
    image: ghcr.io/groundnuty/k8s-wait-for:v2.0

          image: your-migrations-image:tag
          command: ["./run-migrations.sh"]There are pre-install and post-install hooks. Decoupling Migrations from Application CodeCreate separate Docker image for migrations.Use tools like Atlas to manage migrations independently.Version Control for MigrationsStore migration files in your Git repository.Use sequential or timestamp-based versioning.Ensure migrations can be run multiple times without side effects.Implement and test rollback procedures for each migration.Use tools like Atlas Cloud for visibility into migration history.Managing database migrations in a Kubernetes environment requires careful planning and execution. By leveraging tools like golang-migrate, goose, or atlas, and following best practices, you can create robust, scalable, and maintainable migration strategies. Remember to decouple migrations from application code, use version control, and implement proper monitoring to ensure smooth database evolution in your Kubernetes-based architecture.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Servo Lands APNG &amp; Animated WebP Support, Vello Backends For Faster 2D Graphics</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Servo-July-2025-Highlights</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:29:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Servo browser project has published a monthly status report to outline all of the interesting changes made to this interesting, Rust-based browser layout engine over the past several weeks.

The attack caused significant operational disruption and financial losses, with Lu also attempting to cover his tracks by deleting data and researching privilege escalation techniques. BleepingComputer reports: After a corporate restructuring and subsequent demotion in 2018, the DOJ says that Lu retaliated by embedding malicious code throughout the company's Windows production environment. The malicious code included an infinite Java thread loop designed to overwhelm servers and crash production systems. Lu also created a kill switch named "IsDLEnabledinAD" ("Is Davis Lu enabled in Active Directory") that would automatically lock all users out of their accounts if his account was disabled in Active Directory. When his employment was terminated on September 9, 2019, and his account disabled, the kill switch activated, causing thousands of users to be locked out of their systems.
 
"The defendant breached his employer's trust by using his access and technical knowledge to sabotage company networks, wreaking havoc and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses for a U.S. company," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti. When he was instructed to return his laptop, Lu reportedly deleted encrypted data from his device. Investigators later discovered search queries on the device researching how to elevate privileges, hide processes, and quickly delete files. Lu was found guilty earlier this year of intentionally causing damage to protected computers. After his four-year sentence, Lu will also serve three years of supervised release following his prison term.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel&apos;s New LLM-Scaler Beta Update Brings Whisper Model &amp; GLM-4.5-Air Support</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-llm-scaler-vllm-Whisper</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:59:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Earlier this month Intel released LLM-Scaler 1.0 as part of their Project Battlematrix initiative.

We had been slogging along a muddy two-track for hours, the kind of road that eats zip ties and optimism. One of our trucks slid into a washout and sat, nose buried, lights off. Phones had no bars, the satellite hotspot was showing a sad little spinning icon, and the first hour of patience was turning into a cold, long night.I climbed onto the tailgate, unlatched the case, and set the Nomad 2 on the bumper. I raised the telescoping mast, swung the omni up, and in five minutes the dashboard showed a clean heartbeat. Positions flowed back to base. Two medics coordinated a tow. Nobody panicked. It was not magic. It was good design, the right expectations, and the sort of product you can hand to someone and trust them to get it running.That is what I want to write about: not specs, not marketing copy, but the honest shape of what the Nomad 2 does for people who move where infrastructure does not.What separates field gear from consumer toys is how quickly a stranger can get it working under bad light. Nomad 2’s case snaps open without a phalanx of adapters. The controls are a few physical buttons and a hearty LED ring that reads like a living thing — charging, discharging, fault. The mast locks with a single twist. The power ports are sensible and labeled in plain text.In my work I have watched volunteers—people with no soldering past and a lot of grit—mount that mast, plug in a handheld node, and start a mesh. That immediacy is the quiet engineering win. If you want hardware to be useful in the field, make it idiot-resistant and repairable.Power that behaves like an allyNomad 2 is not a miracle. It is a concentrated promise: give me sunlight or alternator, and I will keep comms alive long enough for you to make a plan. In practice that meant different things on different days. On sun-rich afternoons the unit kept a gateway and two handheld nodes alive for 48 hours of intermittent use. In chilly, overcast conditions runtime dropped, as batteries do. That is not a failure — it is reality. What mattered was how the unit communicated that reality. Voltage readouts, state-of-charge percentages, and a conservative low-battery warning gave us time to move batteries, swap loads, or adjust beacon rates.Two lessons I keep repeating to teams: first, plan for half the quoted runtime in the field. Second, treat solar as insurance, not the primary engine, unless you are in the desert and have space for a big panel. Nomad 2 makes this easy with intuitive charging behavior and a robust BMS that handled our rough cycles without complaining.Networking: the right bridge at the right timeA gateway is only useful if it knows how to wallflower until the party needs it. What I liked about the Nomad 2 setup is the way it balanced local talk with backhaul. It ran a local LoRa gateway and a small compute stack for message queuing and lightweight bridging. That meant when the satellite link cut, the mesh kept operating and queued STATUS packets until a link returned. When the link came up, everything flushed cleanly.In one exercise the satellite link showed 400 ms latency and 25 percent packet loss. The Nomad 2’s gateway gave priority to position and SOS messages and relegated logs and bulk telemetry to a deferred channel. That is how you make a gateway useful: you shape data by mission urgency, not by bandwidth greed.The parts that made me nod — and the parts I want betterI will be candid. The ruggedity is real. The housing shrugged off mud, a half hour under drizzle, and a tumble off a low bumper. The connectors were solid. The MPPT controller behaved predictably and the thermal behavior was reasonable under load.But nothing is perfect. In one sub-zero night, the reported state-of-charge drifted a few percent until we recalibrated. Connections for some third-party antennas were fiddly and I wish the vendor standardized on a single rugged connector family. Those are not deal breakers. They are the sort of real-world gripes that get fixed quickly if they appear in customer field notes. I expect Nomad 2’s team to tighten those edges in future revisions.Day-to-day rituals that made Nomad 2 singIf you want any device to survive real missions you have to treat it like gear, not software. With Nomad 2 we built a short ritual that paid dividends: Verify battery health, cable seating, and mast latch. Keep nodes at a sane duty cycle during transit. Burst when needed. Nomad 2 supports staged updates; use them. Roll out on one noncritical unit before fleet updates.Pack a spare antenna and an N-type adaptor. They take up little room and buy you a lot of options.These are small habits. They matter more than most shiny features.When hardware becomes a storyPeople remember equipment by what it allowed them to do. For me, Nomad 2 is tied to one night where a small team finished a search because we could coordinate. The device did not act alone. It was a pack of volunteers who knew the checklists, a simple dashboard that translated beacons into action, and a spare battery someone handed across a muddy ditch. But the Nomad 2 was the piece of kit that brought those elements together without drama.That is the real test for field gear. Can it be trusted when the rest of the world goes quiet? Is it straightforward enough for someone who has never seen it to operate? Does it communicate failure modes in plain language? Nomad 2 passed those tests in my runs. It was not flawless. It was honest.If you build gear for the field, design for the weather and the human, not the benchmark. The Nomad 2 is a thoughtful tool that recognizes those constraints. Use it with reasonable expectations, and it will pay you back with uptime, predictability, and a few quiet nights where everything hums and no one has to make a terrible improvisation.If you want to test one in the wild, don’t ship it alone. Ship it with a wiring diagram, two spare N-type adaptors, and the expectation that you will learn something the first time you use it. That’s how tools get better. That’s how teams survive.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blockchain Cracks Open Wall Street’s Most Guarded Asset Class</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-cracks-open-wall-streets-most-guarded-asset-class?source=rss</link><author>Olga Vox</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:50:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
For decades, private markets have been the land of the locked-up. If you invested in private equity, venture funds, or private credit, you knew one thing for certain: your money was going to be tied up for years. Liquidity was a privilege reserved for public markets, leaving trillions of dollars in private assets effectively frozen.But that model is starting to crack. The rise of blockchain technology and the push toward tokenization are promising to make private markets look and feel more like public ones — liquid, transparent, and accessible. What was once a speculative vision is now moving into the regulatory and institutional mainstream.\
According to McKinsey, tokenized assets could represent , and as much as  in an optimistic scenario. Other forecasts are even bolder: Security Token Market has projected the space could balloon toward .Take real estate. Deloitte estimates tokenized real estate alone could reach , while tokenized loans and securitizations could surpass . Today, the numbers are still small — around $26 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) outside of stablecoins, according to RWA.xyz — but the trajectory is unmistakable.The opportunity is clear: trillions of dollars are trapped in illiquid structures, while global capital is desperate for yield. Tokenization is the bridge that can connect the two.Regulation: The Missing Rail Falls Into PlaceFor years, the biggest bottleneck wasn’t technology — it was regulation. Now, that’s starting to change in the United States.The GENIUS Act (2025) requires stablecoins to be fully backed by low-risk assets like U.S. dollars and gives holders super-priority in bankruptcy. It’s one of the clearest signs that Washington is willing to legitimize tokenized money as part of the system.The CLARITY Act expands the CFTC’s role in crypto trading — signaling a tilt toward treating certain tokenized assets as commodities rather than securities.The FIT21 Act, passed in 2024, laid the groundwork for digital asset markets to operate under clear jurisdictional boundaries between the SEC and CFTC.The SEC’s “Project Crypto”, launched in July 2025, is explicitly focused on bringing U.S. capital markets on-chain. SEC Chair Paul Atkins called it an effort to “distinguish securities from non-securities, facilitate tokenized securities, and enable DeFi super-apps.”Even the Federal Reserve is leaning in. Governor Michelle Bowman urged regulators to “move away from a cautious mindset” on blockchain finance, calling the GENIUS Act a pivotal step forward.For tokenized private markets, this regulatory pivot is a turning point.Institutions Are Already Testing the WatersTokenization is no longer a whitepaper idea. Citi, Wellington, and WisdomTree recently ran pilots on Avalanche’s Spruce subnet, embedding distribution rules for private funds directly into smart contracts.These aren’t “crypto experiments.” They’re early blueprints for how trillions in private assets might eventually move on-chain.So far, most tokenization projects have been wrappers — taking an old financial structure and putting it on a blockchain. That’s useful, but not revolutionary.The real breakthrough will be native tokenized instruments. Imagine a private credit facility or a growth financing round issued as liquid tokens from day one. Compliance is baked into the code. Secondary markets exist from inception. Settlement is near-instant.In that world, investors no longer face decade-long lockups. Founders can access capital without waiting for rare exit events. And the illiquidity premium — the “tax” that has kept private markets inefficient — begins to dissolve.Why This Decade Will Be PivotalThe 2020s will be remembered as the decade private markets went liquid. Not overnight, and not without regulatory hiccups, but the trajectory is set:: trillions locked in private markets are demanding liquidity.: blockchains, smart contracts, and privacy layers have matured.: regulators are no longer just tolerating tokenization — they’re enabling it.As Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman put it:“We need to move away from a cautious mindset on digital assets. Tokenization and blockchain-based finance will be pivotal to the modernization of U.S. markets.” \n (Barron’s)The transformation of private markets will not come from repackaging yesterday’s assets. It will come from designing tomorrow’s instruments — token-native, programmable, and globally liquid.The illiquidity era is ending. What comes next will be nothing less than the reinvention of how capital moves.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI “Revolution” Is Still Stuck in a Chatbox</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-revolution-is-still-stuck-in-a-chatbox?source=rss</link><author>Maksym Kunytskyi</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:49:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ll be honest: I’m tired of hearing about the It’s 2025.

This is an area most beginner developers struggle to grasp, and even some experienced Solidity developers still don’t fully understand.What are these ‘special words’? They are words that specify the main data locations in a Solidity smart contract. Data locations in Solidity describe where data can be stored and how it can be accessed on the Ethereum blockchain. Other data locations include the following:In this article, you will learn the differences between each main data location option and where to use each.Firstly, what is storage?Storage is the data location that holds a smart contract’s state variables. A state variable is data that lives permanently on the blockchain. Each smart contract has its own storage space (an array of 2^256 32-byte slots), and state variables are automatically assigned to .The code snippet below shows a simple implementation of a state variable stored in storage, as well as its getter and setter functions: \n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Storage {
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; // STATE VARIABLES //////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; uint256 public s_storedData; // s_storedData is a storage variable, s_ denotes a storage variable
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; // SETTER FUNCTION //////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; function set(uint256 x) public {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s_storedData = x; // This value is saved permanently on-chain
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; // GETTER FUNCTION //////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; /////////////////////////////
&nbsp; &nbsp; function getStoredData() public view returns(uint256) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return s_storedData;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
In the code above, the   remains on the blockchain after the set() function runs.More importantly, storage is one of the major data location options that isn’t explicitly specified. Any variable declared outside any function is implicitly converted to a storage variable.The  contract above acts as a simple bank, as the name implies. The mapping is stored in , which means it remembers values across function calls.For instance, if Alice calls , her balance is saved in  in the  mapping. Conversely, if she calls , she receives  and the mapping updates to .Unlike Storage, Memory is a temporary, function-scope data location. Function-scope means, variables exist only during a function call, not at the contract-level, and clears afterwards. Additionally,  allows for read-write access; this means variables are modified within a function. Solidity allocates memory to variables defined inside a function(local variables) or parameters marked .// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Memory {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function multiply(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uint256 result = a * b; // 'result' is stored in memory
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return result; // 'result' does NOT persist after the function ends
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
In the code above, Solidity implicitly stores  in memory, which does not persist after the function execution.The code below concatenates two string inputs, ,  exist while the function  runs.A note on function parameters// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Memory {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function multiply(uint256 memory a, uint256 memory b) public pure returns (uint256) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uint256 result = a * b;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return result;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
For function parameters, you can’t specify the keyword for , , and  variables as they are directly stored on the contract’s stack, no explicit keyword.Whereas for reference types like , , , , and , you will have to specify or defaults to  for internal and private functions and  for external and public functions(more on this below👇).Lightly touched on in the previous section,  is another temporary data location, but it’s reserved for  function parameters.  Also, unlike ,  cannot be modified. To explain what this means, let’s take a look at the code below:// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Example {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function tryChangeCalldata(uint[] calldata nums) external pure returns (uint[] calldata) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; nums[0] = 999; // ❌ ERROR — "calldata is read-only"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return nums;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
The error message above shows that calldata is read-only. To modify  variables, they must first be loaded into .Take the adjusted code below now modified .The code below works because the it loads  variable to  before modifying it in the  block.// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;
contract Example {
&nbsp; &nbsp; function tryChangeCalldata(uint[] calldata nums)&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; external&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pure&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; returns (uint[] memory)&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Copy from calldata to memory
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; uint[] memory numsCopy = new uint[](nums.length);
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for (uint i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; numsCopy[i] = nums[i];
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Now modify the copy
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (numsCopy.length > 0) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; numsCopy[0] = 999;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return numsCopy;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
}
Using appropriate data locations matters as they directly affect how your contracts store, access, and pay for data.  The differences can have a large impact on cost, behaviour, and security of your smart contracts. Here’s how:Writing data to Storage is the most expensive.The gas costs in Memory is more moderate than storage.Calldata is the cheapest data location, i.e., writing to calldata costs the least amount of gas.Persistence and TemporarinessAny data written to Storage lives onchain, meaning the data is permanent.Memory only persists during the function’s lifecycle.Calldata acts like  in handling data, only it can’t be changed.Storage data can be modified.Similar to Storage, Memory can be modified but only within the context of a function.Storage can be a risky choice of location because mistakes or hacks can permanently change the blockchain’s state.Memory is a safer option since changes are temporary.Calldata is the safest for passing input for  functions.That’s it for this piece, as previously stated, using the appropriate data locations is integral to the functionality of your contracts. I implore you to research further about the other types of data locations mentioned in the introduction of this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Networking : Why You Should Understand the IPv4 Header Beyond Chasing Tools</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/networking-why-you-should-understand-the-ipv4-header-beyond-chasing-tools?source=rss</link><author>Verlaine j muhungu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:43:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
In a trendy tech industry, network engineering seems overshadowed by many trends, and many people forget the importance of the fundamentals of networking.Cloud, AI, Cybersecurity, Cloud computing, Software development, how many times do you see networking mentioned among the critical skills to learn? In the fast-paced tech industry, network engineering often gets overlooked amidst emerging trends. Many tend to forget the crucial role of networking fundamentals.: when discussions revolve around critical skills to acquire, how frequently is networking mentioned alongside cloud, AI, cybersecurity, and software development?:::info
This is article is dedicated to anyone struggling to learn networking,not experts in the fieldNetwork engineering is the foundationIn this AI era, we see the emergence of massive data centers around the world, including , , and , slated to be the world's largest AI supercomputer, as well as other projects in the making for the AI race. One question arises: who will build the infrastructure?Network engineers and architects are essential for maintaining the internet and ensuring a connected future. The global economy depends on their ability to route information across all environments, from the sky to the oceans; without their expertise, nothing would function.Imagine a day with 24 hours of no connectivity, where the world is unconnected with all the continents without internet access. Space entrepreneurship, exemplified by , highlights the critical role of connectivity. It bridges the gap for previously unconnected global regions, unlocking new opportunities. Without robust networking, global connections would be impossible. The field of network engineering is continuously evolving, ensuring that those with mastery of these skills will always be in high demand.Consider a world where, for 24 hours, all continents are without connectivity, an unthinkable scenario!It’s easy to adopt some tools and skip fundamentals; unfortunately, your gaps will betray you in the long run!Seeing the trends, many people neglected networking to jump quickly to cloud, cybersecurity, or automation.How to deploy networks you do not understand?How to secure a network you do not understand?How to automate workflows you do not understand?\
Reality check: those who neglected networking will come back to learnJust because script kiddies use some tools to hack means they know what they do; networking is complex and requires the fundamentals to understand what happens under the hood. Today,  it’s possible to meet cloud engineers with huge gaps in networking!Because of the ease of use of some graphical user interfaces to provision devices and networks, network engineering was neglected, and we will see a huge skill gap in the future.

These agents, however, are frequently designed and implemented within siloed ecosystems, which hinders their ability to communicate, collaborate, and interoperate effectively across platforms. The absence of universal standards for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human communication presents a significant architectural challenge for the development of scalable, heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Traditional methods of integration, such as RESTful APIs or remote procedure calls (RPCs), are often insufficient due to their stateless nature and rigid, pre-defined schemas, which are not well-suited for the dynamic, multi-turn, and context-aware interactions required by modern agents. This fundamental lack of a unified communication substrate prevents the formation of a cohesive "internet of agents." This article addresses this challenge by providing a formal, comparative analysis of three prominent and distinct protocols designed to address this issue: Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), and Agent-User Interaction (AGUI). These protocols represent foundational layers of the agentic AI stack, each solving a unique interoperability problem.1.2. Methodology and ScopeThis analysis will proceed by systematically defining each protocol, delineating its architectural design, and identifying its intended use case. This process involves a formal review of available specifications, reference implementations, and research publications to establish a clear and technically accurate understanding of each protocol's core components and operational principles. A comparative framework will then be established to highlight the functional distinctions and underlying philosophical principles of each protocol. Key criteria for comparison will include: the primary interaction type (inter-agent vs. agent-to-human), the architectural model employed (e.g., client-server, event-driven), and key features such as agent discovery, security, and state management. The scope of this article is limited to an examination of the protocols' foundational principles and their contributions to the broader agentic ecosystem. It does not include a detailed implementation guide or a performance benchmark analysis, but will include code samples to illustrate the conceptual application of each protocol within its respective domain. The objective is to provide a clear and structured understanding of these protocols for researchers, developers, and engineers working in the nascent field of agentic AI.                          +------------------+

2 Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol2.1. Definition and PurposeThe A2A protocol, initially developed by Google, is an open standard designed to facilitate seamless, secure communication and collaboration between heterogeneous AI agents from different vendors or frameworks. It provides a structured, declarative framework for agents to discover each other, understand capabilities, and exchange tasks and messages. Its primary purpose is to enable scalable and resilient multi-agent ecosystems by establishing a common language for interaction, thereby moving beyond ad-hoc, point-to-point integrations.2.2. Architectural PrinciplesA2A operates on a client-server model and utilizes a defined protocol stack, often built on existing web technologies such as HTTP and JSON-RPC. Key components include: A central mechanism for agent discovery. These are JSON-formatted metadata files that enable agents to advertise their capabilities, contact endpoints, and supported data modalities. This serves as an agent's "business card" and enables a dynamic, decentralized registry. The Agent Card provides a standardized schema for describing an agent's core identity (, , ), operational state (, ), and skill set (). A client agent can dynamically fetch an Agent Card from a well-known URL to determine if a remote agent possesses the necessary capabilities to fulfill a given request. This approach eliminates the need for a central, monolithic service registry, promoting decentralized and flexible discovery. Communication is centered around the concept of a task, which represents a unit of work with a defined lifecycle (e.g., submitted, working, completed, failed, or input-required). Messages are the fundamental units of communication within a task's lifecycle, conveying instructions, context, replies, and artifacts. This model is designed to support both quick, single-turn interactions and long-running, multi-turn workflows. A message is composed of structured , which can contain various data types, including text, images, or even tool calls. This multi-modal support allows for rich, nuanced interactions between agents. The clear delineation of a task lifecycle allows client agents to monitor progress and handle asynchronous responses gracefully, which is essential for managing complex, interdependent workflows. The protocol integrates modern authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0, to ensure secure cross-agent interactions and protect sensitive data exchanged between systems. A2A also supports end-to-end encryption to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of messages between agents. The protocol's reliance on established security standards provides a robust and auditable framework for managing trust in a distributed agentic ecosystem. This is a critical feature, as agents may be developed and deployed by different organizations, each with its own security requirements and trust boundaries.A2A is optimized for scenarios involving multi-agent orchestration, where multiple autonomous agents must collaborate to achieve a complex, overarching goal. For example, a financial agent could delegate a specific sub-task, such as "research market trends," to a specialized research agent, and then process the returned data. This delegation pattern enables the development of highly specialized, modular agents that can be composed dynamically to handle complex workflows.The A2A protocol's support for both synchronous and streaming communication patterns further enhances its utility, allowing for rapid, non-blocking exchanges as well as real-time, token-by-token updates for tasks such as generative text output or live data analysis. The protocol's architectural flexibility is designed to handle the variability inherent in agentic workflows. For instance, a client agent can initiate a task with a single request and then asynchronously consume a stream of results or intermediate thoughts from the remote agent, enabling a responsive and efficient user experience. This asynchronous capability is crucial for building robust systems that can handle long-running, non-deterministic tasks without blocking. A2A’s focus on structured messaging ensures that information is exchanged in a machine-readable format, facilitating automated parsing and processing by other agents. The clear separation of concerns, where "Agent Cards" handle discovery and the core protocol handles communication, provides a clean and scalable architectural pattern. The following Python code illustrates a contemporary A2A client implementation that demonstrates both synchronous and streaming message handling. The code provides a clear example of how an agent can initiate a task and either wait for a complete response or process a continuous stream of information, reflecting the protocol's flexibility.from a2a.types import (

3.1. Definition and PurposeThe Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), originally introduced by IBM's BeeAI and now under the governance of the Linux Foundation, is an open standard for agent interoperability. Its fundamental purpose is to serve as a universal communication layer that transforms the current fragmented landscape of AI agents into a cohesive, interconnected network. In essence, ACP is designed to be the "internet protocol for agents," providing a common, vendor-agnostic language that allows agents built with different frameworks and technology stacks to discover and communicate with one another seamlessly. This addresses the critical challenge of interoperability at the enterprise scale, where diverse agents and systems must collaborate without the need for custom, point-to-point integrations.3.2. Architectural PrinciplesACP is architected with simplicity and flexibility as its core design principles. Unlike more complex, task-centric protocols, ACP favors a REST-based communication model that leverages standard HTTP conventions. This approach makes it highly accessible to developers, as it can be integrated with standard web tools like  and is not strictly dependent on a dedicated software development kit (SDK), although official SDKs are available. The design philosophy of ACP is to minimize overhead and maximize compatibility with existing web infrastructure, making it a natural choice for rapid deployment in brownfield environments.REST-based Communication: ACP defines a set of well-defined REST endpoints for key operations, such as agent discovery and task execution. This reliance on familiar web patterns significantly lowers the barrier to entry for development and integration. By adhering to the principles of REST, ACP ensures that agents can be treated as standard web resources, simplifying routing, load balancing, and scaling for developers and system administrators. The protocol uses MIME types for content identification, which allows it to handle any data format, including text, images, audio, video, or custom binary data, without requiring protocol modifications. This flexibility is crucial for multi-modal agents that must process and generate diverse types of information. It ensures that the protocol remains relevant as AI capabilities expand beyond purely text-based communication.Asynchronous-First Design: ACP is built with asynchronous communication as the default pattern, which is ideal for long-running, non-blocking tasks. It also supports synchronous requests for simple, quick interactions. This dual-model approach provides the best of both worlds, enabling efficient and responsive systems. For example, a client can initiate a complex generative task and continue with other work while asynchronously receiving updates from the agent. A unique feature of ACP is its support for offline agent discovery. Agents can embed metadata directly into their distribution packages, which enables them to be discovered even in disconnected or "scale-to-zero" environments where resources are not always active. This is particularly valuable for edge computing or IoT applications where network connectivity may be intermittent.ACP's design makes it ideal for building decentralized, large-scale agent networks where a wide variety of agents from different organizations must interoperate. A prime use case is in a supply chain or logistics network, where a manufacturing agent, a logistics agent, and a customs agent—each built by a different company—must collaborate to fulfill an order. ACP's vendor-agnostic and simple-to-integrate nature allows these heterogeneous systems to seamlessly communicate and share information, streamlining complex, cross-organizational workflows. This enables a "plug-and-play" model for agent ecosystems, where new agents can be added or existing ones replaced with minimal disruption. The protocol's asynchronous-first design is particularly beneficial here, as tasks like calculating shipping routes or clearing customs can be time-consuming, and the system can continue operating without waiting for an immediate response. The following Python code illustrates a basic ACP client-server interaction. The server exposes a simple agent, while the client interacts with it using the official ACP SDK.import asyncio

from acp_sdk.models import Message, MessagePart

4 Agent-User Interaction (AGUI) Protocol4.1. Definition and PurposeThe Agent-User Interaction (AGUI) Protocol is an emerging standard designed to bridge the chasm between autonomous AI agents and dynamic, event-driven user interfaces. While A2A and ACP focus on machine-to-machine communication, AGUI is purpose-built to enable a rich, bi-directional, and real-time dialogue between an intelligent agent and a human user. Its core purpose is to transform static, chat-based UIs into interactive, collaborative surfaces where the agent can not only respond to requests but also proactively generate or modify the interface to guide the user or display dynamic information. This paradigm shifts the user experience from merely observing an agent's output to actively collaborating with it in a fluid, intuitive environment.4.2. Architectural PrinciplesAGUI is architected as an event-driven protocol, a fundamental departure from the request-response models of A2A and ACP. It is transport-agnostic, supporting technologies such as WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to maintain persistent, low-latency connections. Key architectural principles include:Event-Driven Communication: The protocol defines a structured event stream, allowing the agent to emit a variety of event types, such as  (for minor UI updates),  (to show a tool is being used), or  (for streaming text). This granular approach allows the user interface to react in real-time, providing live feedback and dynamic visualizations as the agent works.Bi-Directional Context Flow: AGUI supports a seamless flow of information in both directions. Agents can send events to update the UI, and the UI can send  packets to the agent to provide feedback, inject new context, or override ongoing tasks. This "human-in-the-loop" capability is critical for complex workflows requiring user confirmation or input. The protocol leverages minimal delta updates, often based on JSON Patch semantics, to synchronize the UI's state with the agent's internal state. This approach reduces bandwidth and eliminates the need for full UI refreshes, resulting in a more responsive and efficient application.The AGUI protocol is the foundational layer for building next-generation, interactively autonomous applications. Its use cases extend far beyond simple chatbots to include real-time dashboards, collaborative design tools, and complex data analysis platforms. For instance, a financial analysis agent could use AGUI to not only present a final report but also to dynamically generate charts, update them with live market data, and offer the user interactive controls to adjust parameters and re-run simulations. By separating the agent's logic from the UI's presentation, AGUI enables designers and frontend developers to create rich, responsive experiences without needing to understand the intricacies of the underlying AI model. This separation of concerns allows for a more scalable and flexible development process, where the UI can be re-skinned or adapted for different platforms (e.g., mobile, desktop) while still connecting to the same agent back-end. Furthermore, AGUI's support for bi-directional streaming means that the user is no longer a passive observer; they can actively collaborate with the agent, providing real-time feedback that influences the agent's reasoning and actions. This paradigm is crucial for domains such as creative design, software development with AI copilots, and data science, where the human-in-the-loop is a necessary component of the workflow. The following JavaScript code demonstrates a front-end client listening for and reacting to different event types from an AGUI-enabled agent.// AGUI Client Example (JavaScript)

// This example demonstrates how a web-based client can connect to an AGUI server
// and handle various events to create a dynamic user experience.

// A simple AGUI client class using WebSockets for communication.
class AGUIClient {
  constructor(url) {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(url);
    this.eventHandlers = new Map();
    this.ws.onmessage = this.handleMessage.bind(this);
    this.ws.onopen = () => console.log("Connected to AGUI server.");
    this.ws.onclose = () => console.log("Disconnected from AGUI server.");
    this.ws.onerror = (error) => console.error("WebSocket error:", error);
  }

  // Register a handler for a specific event type.
  on(eventType, handler) {
    if (!this.eventHandlers.has(eventType)) {
      this.eventHandlers.set(eventType, []);
    }
    this.eventHandlers.get(eventType).push(handler);
  }

  // Handle incoming messages by parsing them and dispatching to handlers.
  handleMessage(event) {
    try {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      const handlers = this.eventHandlers.get(data.type) || [];
      handlers.forEach(handler => handler(data.payload));
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Failed to parse or handle AGUI event:", e);
    }
  }

  // Send a USER_EVENT back to the agent.
  sendUserEvent(eventType, payload) {
    const event = {
      type: "USER_EVENT",
      payload: {
        eventType,
        data: payload
      }
    };
    this.ws.send(JSON.stringify(event));
  }
}

// --- Example Usage in a Web Application ---
const client = new AGUIClient("wss://agui.example.com/agent-endpoint");

// --- Event Handlers for a Dynamic UI ---

// Handle incoming text chunks for streaming output.
client.on("TEXT_MESSAGE_CHUNK", (payload) => {
  document.getElementById("chat-output").innerText += payload.delta;
});

// Handle live state updates, such as a progress bar.
client.on("STATE_DELTA", (payload) => {
  if (payload.path === "task.progress") {
    document.getElementById("progress-bar").style.width = `${payload.delta}%`;
  }
});

// Handle a tool call event to update the UI with a "thinking" state.
client.on("TOOL_CALL_START", (payload) => {
  const toolName = payload.tool;
  document.getElementById("status-indicator").innerText = `Agent is using tool: ${toolName}`;
});

// Handle a tool result to display the output.
client.on("TOOL_CALL_RESULT", (payload) => {
  document.getElementById("status-indicator").innerText = "Agent is done.";
  console.log("Tool result:", payload.result);
});

// --- Example of User Interaction Sending an Event ---
// Imagine a button that a user clicks to provide additional context.
document.getElementById("override-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  client.sendUserEvent("OVERRIDE_TASK", {
    reason: "User wants to manually adjust parameters."
  });
});
5.1. Functional DichotomyA formal comparison of the three protocols reveals a clear functional dichotomy. Both  and  are designed as inter-agent communication protocols. Their primary purpose is to enable machine-to-machine dialogue, facilitating the discovery, delegation, and orchestration of tasks between autonomous, backend systems. While they serve a similar high-level purpose, the distinction between them lies in their architectural philosophy and target environment: A2A is more task-centric with a structured lifecycle and is often used for multi-agent composition within a managed or federated ecosystem. In contrast, ACP is more network-centric and relies on a simpler, REST-based model for broad, enterprise-scale interoperability across a diverse, decentralized network. In contrast,  is an agent-to-human interaction protocol. Its sole purpose is to serve as the critical interface between the agentic back-end and the human-facing front-end. It is not designed for agent-to-agent communication, but rather for providing a rich, real-time, and bi-directional channel for a single agent to communicate its internal state and receive direct feedback from a human user.Despite their functional differences, all three protocols share a common philosophical goal: . They each serve to remove a different type of barrier or intermediary within the modern AI application stack, creating a more direct and efficient interaction. addresses vendor-specific disintermediation. It removes the need for custom, framework-specific bridges, allowing agents built by different organizations or with different technologies (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen) to communicate directly and natively. This fosters a competitive ecosystem of specialized agents. addresses network disintermediation. By creating a simple, REST-based protocol for agent interoperability, it removes the complexity of establishing a centralized registry or complex, long-running connections for a distributed network of agents, enabling a "plug-and-play" model at the enterprise level. This simplifies the integration of heterogeneous systems in large organizations. addresses user interface disintermediation. It removes the traditional, static UI layer that acts as a passive, read-only interface to the agent. It allows the agent to directly manipulate the UI, and the user to directly influence the agent's behavior, transforming the interaction from a simple query-and-response into a live, collaborative workflow.5.3. Interplay and Architectural SynergyIt is important to recognize that these protocols are not mutually exclusive; rather, they are designed to be synergistic components of a complete agentic architecture. An ideal, end-to-end system could leverage the strengths of each protocol. For example, a user interacting with a web application might send a request to a primary agent via . This agent could then use the  protocol to delegate a sub-task to a specialized research agent. The research agent, in turn, could use the  protocol to request data from a third-party logistics agent in a different organization. Finally, all three agents' intermediate progress and final results could be streamed back to the user's interface in real-time via the  protocol, providing a transparent and dynamic user experience. This layered approach illustrates how A2A, ACP, and AGUI form a comprehensive stack for agentic systems, from the backend to the user-facing frontend.Furthermore, this synergy enables the creation of highly resilient and modular systems. If an  connection to a specialized agent fails, the primary agent can dynamically discover and delegate the task to an alternative agent using the same protocol, ensuring continuity of service. The simplicity of the  protocol allows a vast number of heterogeneous agents, from edge devices to cloud-based services, to be seamlessly integrated into the network. This provides a robust foundation for a truly decentralized "internet of agents." On top of this,  adds the crucial human-in-the-loop layer. It is this combination that transforms a collection of autonomous systems into a cohesive, collaborative intelligence network that can fluidly adapt to new information, delegate tasks across organizational boundaries, and communicate its state in a way that is both transparent and actionable for a human user. The formalization of these protocols is not just a technical detail; it is a critical step toward making agentic AI a practical and reliable reality for both developers and end-users.The preceding analysis has formally defined and compared three critical protocols in the emerging field of agentic AI: A2A, ACP, and AGUI. Our investigation has revealed that while A2A and ACP focus on standardizing communication between autonomous agents, AGUI is dedicated to the unique challenges of agent-human collaboration. This functional dichotomy is underpinned by a shared philosophical commitment to disintermediation, as each protocol seeks to remove a different layer of friction in the AI application stack.The A2A protocol provides a robust framework for multi-agent composition, enabling structured, task-centric workflows across different vendor ecosystems. Its emphasis on a declarative task lifecycle and multi-modal message support positions it as a powerful tool for building complex, delegated systems. The ACP, in contrast, offers a simplified, REST-based approach to agent interoperability, prioritizing broad compatibility and ease of deployment in decentralized enterprise environments. Its design as a network-centric protocol makes it an ideal choice for creating a "plug-and-play" agent ecosystem. Finally, the AGUI protocol is the key to unlocking the full potential of these backend agents for human users. By enabling a real-time, event-driven, and bi-directional channel between an agent and a dynamic UI, AGUI elevates the user from a passive observer to an active collaborator, creating a more intuitive and responsive experience.Ultimately, these protocols are not in competition but rather serve as complementary layers in a holistic agentic architecture. Future research should focus on the seamless integration of these standards to create end-to-end systems that are not only interoperable at the backend but also transparent and interactive at the frontend, thereby accelerating the deployment of next-generation AI applications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Code Reviews That Truly Elevate Frontend Quality</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/code-reviews-that-truly-elevate-frontend-quality?source=rss</link><author>Den Odell</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:41:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Frontend reviews pass quickly, but don't look at the things users actually touch - the product.

You've probably heard it somewhere: some media or financial personality claiming that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic or inherent value, and this, apparently, is some kind of scam or damning mistake. For instance, Jamie Dimon, chief of the financial multinational JP Morgan Chase,  with complete confidence: “Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value.” Which is pretty ironic, because his company handles billions in assets that don’t have intrinsic value either. We mean dollars (USD). No, fiat money (dollars, euros, any national currency) doesn’t have intrinsic value. Precious metals, then? Still no. Here’s a funny thing: if you ask five people to define "intrinsic value," you’ll get five very different answers, none of which really hold up when you dig a little deeper. In reality, no asset (fiat, gold, crypto) has value unless we humans agree it does. So maybe the question isn’t whether crypto has intrinsic value, but whether anything ever really has and why this matters —or not.What Is Intrinsic Value, Anyway?Economists, philosophers, and investors  this for centuries, and the answers range from unsatisfying to downright contradictory. Classical economics tried to define it as the labor put into making something. Later,  like Ludwig von Mises argued that value is purely subjective: an object is only worth what someone is willing to give for it.In any case, the idea of intrinsic value suggests that certain things have worth in and of themselves, regardless of what people think or do. But is that really how value works? Think about something like gold. Many argue it’s valuable because of its physical properties, like durability and scarcity. But if no one cared about gold, would it still hold value? Probably not. Value isn’t something that exists inside an object; it comes from people’s desires and choices. If everyone stopped wanting gold tomorrow, its price would collapse, no matter how rare or shiny it is. This shows that value isn’t an inherent trait but rather something we assign based on our preferences. History reveals how easily people confuse intrinsic value with other concepts, like usefulness or tradition. And value  derived from usefulness or tradition, indeed, but it's none of those things. The truth is, value isn’t stored in objects like some hidden ingredient; it’s created by supply and demand. People want things, and scarcity makes them more desirable. That’s why air (essential but abundant) is free, while gold (less essential but scarce) is expensive.Intrinsic Value vs. Intrinsic PropertiesSo, does intrinsic value exist? The answer seems to be no. Value is always tied to human judgment. Even something as universally prized as gold only holds worth because people agree on its importance. This doesn’t mean gold isn’t useful or historically significant, but its value depends on our choices, not some unchangeable law. On the other hand, its value can come, at least partially, from its own properties.Here’s where a lot of people get tangled up: they confuse an asset’s intrinsic properties (the things it really is) with its value, which lives entirely in our heads. People often say that gold has “intrinsic value”, but what it really has are intrinsic . Gold is shiny, malleable, scarce, and it doesn’t rust. Those traits are part of its nature. And because of them, humans have always found it appealing for jewelry, prestige, and yes, money.Those properties alone don’t automatically make it valuable, though. Properties are the canvas; the value is the story we paint on it. It comes from us deciding that those properties matter enough to trade for. Salt, too, is a great example. It preserves food and seasons meals, but its usefulness only translates into value when people actually want or need it. We can stretch this idea to modern tech and money as well.Cryptos Have Intrinsic Properties When critics say, “Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value,” what they often miss is that cryptos do have intrinsic properties, and those properties are pretty remarkable. Unlike fiat money, which is just paper or pixels on a screen controlled by governments, cryptocurrencies are designed to be portable, autonomous, resistant to censorship (no frozen accounts), and accessible anywhere in the world. You can send Bitcoin, Ether, GBYTE, or another crypto to someone on the other side of the globe in minutes, often without needing a bank, documents, or paying hefty fees. That’s something neither gold nor fiat money can do with the same efficiency.Gold does have some impressive traits and a historic perception of value, but try paying your rent with a gold coin or mailing some to a friend overseas. Not exactly practical. On the flip side, fiat currencies are easy to spend, but they’re vulnerable to inflation and political manipulation. Governments can print more at will (just like that, backed by nothing), which erodes your savings over time. Governments can also freeze accounts or prevent you from using your money the way you like, e.g. sending abroad or to “undesirable” entities.Many cryptocurrencies, by design, limit how many coins can exist, which can help protect against inflation. And thanks to  (a system where no single authority controls the network), depending on their level of it, these coins and their networks can keep running even if a government or big corporation tries to shut them down, and keep processing all transactions even if a government tries to censor them.On top of that, many cryptos support clever features like : self-executing agreements written into code. These let people create investments, games, decentralized apps, marketplaces, and even loans without intermediaries. However, as with any other asset, all of these brilliant properties still need people to recognize and use them. The prices are set by what others are willing to pay —driven by trust, demand, and human choice.So, what can we take away from all this? Maybe the whole idea of intrinsic value has been a red herring all along. We humans have always assigned value to things based on trust, utility (which itself is subjective), and our collective stories about what’s important. The fact that cryptos need belief to function doesn’t make them any different from gold bars locked in Fort Knox, or from the paper bills in your wallet. Now, it doesn’t mean they can’t be useful or have actual properties, either. There’s a reason why millions of people have found them appealing enough to thrust and use.  is a good example of a crypto ecosystem with useful properties that set it apart from both traditional assets and many other coins. Like Bitcoin, it’s decentralized and scarce, but it goes further by eliminating miners and “validators” completely, so there's no middlemen. Instead of a blockchain, Obyte uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which means it’s more censorship-resistant than many other systems.Besides, Obyte doesn’t just offer a store of value; it’s an  for decentralized applications, smart contracts, tokenization, and tamper-proof data storage. Unlike other cryptos, which either focus only on money or only on apps, Obyte combines both. And because it doesn’t rely on energy-hungry mining or a central authority, it’s more resilient than others. All of these intrinsic properties, combined with the trust from its community, are what makes it valuable.In the end, remember: value lives where we decide it lives, whether that’s in gold dust, salty crystals, lines of code, or even a shiny digital token with a dog’s face on it. Whether that value is useful for you, is solely for you to decide.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is AGENTS.md?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/what-is-agentsmd?source=rss</link><author>Vladislav Guzey</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:15:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re like me and work with multiple AI coding agents, you know the frustration of managing different instruction files. It’s a pain to keep everything updated across various formats. But I’ve got some great news for you. A new, simplified standard has emerged, and it’s called AGENTS.md.For a while now, working with different AI agents meant juggling multiple configuration files. Whether it was claude.md, gemini.md, or .cursor/rules, each agent had its own format. This created a mess of redundant files that all needed to be updated separately. It was inefficient and confusing.Big companies recognized this problem. They came together to create a unified solution — AGENTS.md. The goal was to establish a single, predictable place for all AI agents to find the instructions they need to work on a project.Think of AGENTS.md as a README file, but for machines. It’s a simple, open-source format that guides AI coding agents on how to interact with your project. It’s already being used by over 20,000 open-source projects.This file provides all the necessary context for an AI to understand and work on your code, including: Instructions on how to install dependencies and build the project. Rules on formatting and design patterns to ensure consistency. How to run tests to verify changes. Preferred formats for commit messages and linting rules. Any other important information, like security considerations or performance tips.Look at the example below.How to Migrate to AGENTS.mdMigrating to AGENTS.md is straightforward. You can consolidate your existing instruction files in just two simple steps using your terminal: Use the command  to rename your primary instruction file. Use  to create a symbolic link. This ensures backward compatibility with any tools that haven’t been updated to the new standard yet. Create an AGENTS.md file at the root of your repository. Add sections for project overview, build and test commands, code style guidelines, and any other relevant instructions. Include commit messages, pull request guidelines, and anything else a new teammate would need to know.To get the most out of AGENTS.md, here are a few best practices to follow: Keep your instructions clear and to the point.Keep instructions up to date: Make sure the file is always current with your project’s needs. Instead of duplicating information, link to your existing documentation.Use multiple files for monorepos: For large monorepos, you can use nested AGENTS.md files for different subprojects.Video Overview about Agents.MDAnd that’s it! By adopting the AGENTS.md standard, you can streamline your workflow, ensure consistency, and make it easier for AI agents to work with your projects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sovereign AI: The Why and How Behind National LLMs</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/sovereign-ai-the-why-and-how-behind-national-llms?source=rss</link><author>Vik Bogdanov</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:13:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently came across a by Ukrainian researchers analyzing the key trends, challenges, risks, and opportunities of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) at the state level. It compiles global practices in building national LLMs and explores the feasibility of investing in this direction.What is revealing in the report is that GovTech projects today place as much hope in AI as modern businesses do. This signals a turning point: AI is no longer just a corporate innovation but is rapidly transforming into state-level infrastructure,  with nations competing to harness it in pursuit of digital sovereignty.When Technology Serves the StateLLMs are moving beyond R&D labs and startups into the very core of governance. Governments are already experimenting with them to simplify regulatory work, reduce bureaucratic delays, and support citizen communication. AI-powered assistants are helping officials process legal texts, analyze procurement contracts, and ensure compliance with public spending rules.In social services, LLM-based hotlines are offering guidance to farmers, citizens seeking benefits, or people navigating complex legal processes. These tools don’t replace human officials, but rather filter, summarize, and structure information, allowing governments to operate faster and more transparently.Healthcare is another key frontier. Medical staff are increasingly using LLMs to generate discharge reports, summarize patient histories, or predict potential complications. By processing vast amounts of medical data, these systems enable physicians to save time and focus on patient care rather than paperwork.Defense and security might be the most sensitive but also the most transformative domains. Here, LLMs are being applied to open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis, military planning, and even handling communication in a military tone of voice. Unlike commercial applications, these deployments often occur in highly restricted environments, where sovereign control over data and infrastructure is maintained.A telling metric of this shift: in 2024, government use of AI grew by more than 1.5× compared to 2021, fueled largely by national LLMs outperforming global ones in local benchmarks.Strategies and PrioritiesThe first wave of national AI strategies occurred between 2019 and 2020, during which the focus was broader, encompassing digitalization, talent development, and ethical frameworks. Today, those strategies are being updated with LLMs at the center, explicitly. The priorities are clear: — reducing dependence on US or Chinese models and investing in local capacity. For smaller states, this often means joining the EU or regional initiatives; for larger states, it implies building sovereign supercomputers and models from scratch. — ensuring compliance with international standards, protecting personal data, and preventing bias. Transparent governance of AI is emerging as a soft-power tool: countries that demonstrate ethical leadership can influence global norms. — from Europe’s Leonardo supercomputer to India’s Bharat Gen project, the physical layer of AI matters as much as the models. Access to high-performance computing is now a matter of national strategy. — national archives, libraries, and public datasets are being restructured into training corpora. Programs like Horizon Europe and CLARIN both fund research and develop legal frameworks for the safe use of data. — beyond infrastructure, success depends on people. Many countries are channeling funds into startups, research centers, and AI-focused universities to ensure long-term capacity.Building sovereign LLMs requires serious money. Some stand out.The EU aims to maintain Europe's competitiveness in the global race by pledging to invest €1 billion annually through 2027 to strengthen AI ecosystems across its member states. The Netherlands is allocating  for the development of local AI initiatives, which underscores its commitment to building a robust domestic capacity. The Brazilian government has invested  in national AI programs, of which  is specifically reserved for the creation of a national LLM. Meanwhile, India has launched the ambitious , investing  in projects like , which is already being applied in education, agriculture, and healthcare. Together, these investments underscore both the magnitude of financial commitments and the strategic urgency with which countries are prioritizing control over their own AI futures.Funding typically comes through a triple-helix model, comprising public sector support, corporate partnerships, and academic research. This mix spreads risk, ensures applicability, and avoids over-centralization of AI development.National LLM Use Cases Around the WorldThe diversity of national projects shows how flexibly LLMs can be adapted. — In Bulgaria, a sovereign model outperformed ChatGPT and LLaMA in local school exams, demonstrating that domain-specific and language-specific training are crucial for effective performance. Greece uses AI to generate exercises and simplify textbooks, while Singapore integrates LLMs into programming curricula. — Albania’s e-Gov platform integrates AI assistants for administrative processes; Serbia trains specialized models for analyzing legal documents with EU support. In the Netherlands, 39% of municipalities already rely on AI tools. — Sweden’s GPT-SW3 helps summarize patient records and forecast risks. In Kenya, AI chatbots offer guidance to expectant mothers, leveraging automation alongside rigorous human oversight to safeguard sensitive data. — Nigeria’s FarmAdvise chatbot acts as a free, text-based hotline for farmers without internet access. India’s BharatGen supports farmers with real-time insights on crops, weather, and market conditions. — Bulgaria has invested more than $100 million in a sovereign LLM, ensuring sensitive data remains on domestic infrastructure. Germany is pursuing similar sovereign AI projects to reduce dependence on US-based systems. — The US has documented 180+ potential defense applications, from battlefield command support to OSINT. Defence LLAMA and China’s ChatBIT are both examples of domain-specific military models trained in secure environments.These cases illustrate a broader truth: national LLMs are being tailored to reflect not only local languages but also specific institutional needs and cultural contexts.Another country currently building its national LLM is. Despite more than three years of full-scale war, Ukraine is accelerating digital transformation in government — a continuation of reforms that began long before the invasion.For Ukraine, an LLM is not simply a technological upgrade but a strategic necessity. On one hand, it would allow state services to operate securely on domestic infrastructure, without relying on foreign clouds that could be disrupted. On the other hand, it opens entirely new possibilities in Defense Tech, where Ukraine possesses a unique dataset from the battlefield unmatched anywhere in the world. Processing this data through LLMs could generate insights critical for military strategy, resilience, and security.The government has set a bold target: to enable Ukraine to become one of the world’s top three countries in public-sector AI implementation by 2030. To reach this, the Ministry of Digital Transformation is spearheading a multi-phase plan: — sovereign data storage, battlefield intelligence applications, training on Ukrainian archives, scientific literature, and non-sensitive government datasets. — a 9-month first cycle, with a beta version tested in government, academia, and education; later open-sourced with APIs for businesses. — models ranging from 1 to 16 billion parameters are the top priority, balancing efficiency with cost. Models up to 7B can run on a single GPU, while 13–16B require small clusters. Global experience (LLaMA, Gemma, Mistral) shows that well-trained medium models can deliver competitive performance in classification, text generation, and localized tasks. — more than 100 GB of Ukrainian-language data under review, including library archives and research corpora, to ensure the model reflects authentic language, history, and culture.The project is allegedly compliant with IP law, with authors invited to “donate” their works voluntarily, thereby enriching the LLM with an authentic Ukrainian context.Ukraine’s case illustrates both the urgency and the opportunity. While the war creates extraordinary pressures, it also accelerates innovation. The country’s vast pool of battlefield and civic data, coupled with a dynamic govtech and startup ecosystem, positions it to achieve breakthroughs that others cannot. \
If Ukraine succeeds, its model could serve as a blueprint for nations seeking to strike a balance between innovation and sovereignty.Sovereign AI is fast becoming the new : a strategic asset, a deterrent, and a marker of global influence. The nations that move quickly will not only define their own futures but also shape the standards, ethics, and narratives that govern the world’s information order.The question is no longer  national LLMs will matter — but  model will set the terms of tomorrow’s sovereignty.And what's your take on this?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Every Website Doesn’t Need to Be a Full App</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/every-website-doesnt-need-to-be-a-full-app?source=rss</link><author>Den Odell</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:13:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Islands Architecture lets developers ship less, do more, and give users speed where it counts.

By removing risks, the Fed destroyed the capitalism ecosystem.”James, a healthcare professional and the film’s protagonist, seeks financial independence after failing to secure a mortgage for his late wife’s dream property. Guided by Professor Gardner, James invests in real assets, ultimately succeeding in timber trading and relocating to Maine with the property he desired.In the film’s climax, Professor Gardner, on a podcast James helped him launch, declares, “Money printing doesn’t create wealth. Wealth is created by all your hard work.”In this interview, Olayimika Oyebanji speaks to Chris Galizio, executive producer of “Money Game," who shares insights on the broken financial system and how investing in commodities like real estate, gold, Bitcoin, silver mining, etc. can help restore economic balance.Chris, it's really nice to meet you. Can you tell us about yourself and your professional background?Hi Ola, I am a former large cap growth manager at Fidelity and I also ran a hedge fund called Focused Capital. My fund at Fidelity grew from $20M to $7B. When the REPO market spiked in 2019, and the FED stepped in to buy all the bonds, I started to question what was happening. I wrote a white paper called the $340T problem which I published pre-COVID. It refers to the dollar system and how FED action disconnected stocks from fundamentals and broke the ecosystem of capitalism. Then COVID hit and unemployment in the US went to 33%, but FED injected liquidity and stocks actually went UP. This incident changed my view on markets. The FED is protecting the markets.  It’s not an “investing” system, it’s a “financing” system.Once you see it, it’s impossible to unsee it.  It’s the biggest line in Money Game, “Correct, and when the FED intervened in bonds markets, they broke the ecosystem of capitalism.” – Professor Gardner, Money Game ‘25What inspired you to produce “Money Game”, and how did you aim to portray the impact of the Federal Reserve’s money printing on everyday people?“Because I know how the movie ends, my coffee goes from $3 to $30 and everyone blames the “capitalists” and turns to an authoritarian leader like Hitler to save them. I wanted to change the ending and have them blame the central planners (Jerome Powell, Scott Bessent) and return to capitalism.” —- Executive Producer, Money GameI knew that I had a concept that no one else could see, the money system is broken. It’s the opening quote in Money Game: "The task is not so much to see what no one else sees, but to think what no one else has thought about that which everyone sees."- Arthur Schopenhauer – 1851 Money Game, opening Quote Then we hired a screen writer, Brian Cheek, to build a story around the concept. We used my brother’s story as the storyline. My brother is a widowed father of two kids. He represents the real economy that is struggling with inflation as the FED prints money from “thin air” to protect the rich (the money system). It’s not capitalism anymore, capitalism requires risk to allocate scarce resources, when the FED intervened the system began to misallocate resources which slows the real economy.“Our system is broken. It’s clear now that money printing sends asset prices up.  What’s less clear is that it also slows the real economy as we misallocate resources. Now we have two different economies, the financial economy, and the real economy, that no longer work together. Money printing does not create wealth, wealth is created by all your hard work.” --- Professor Gardner, Money Game ’25.Notice that the market never reacts to news anymore. Trump said that he wants to increase tariffs on semiconductors by 300% and the Semi stocks like AMD and AVGO that import most of their chips barely moved. Why? Because the entire system is machines that do not read the news. No one is setting prices anymore and that should send a chill down every investor’s spine. "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened." --- Obi-Wan KenobiHow did you approach balancing the film’s entertainment value with its critique of the fiat system and advocacy for alternative investments?Movies need to be entertainment, no one goes to a movie for a lecture. So we made a love story, where the good guy wins. We put all the technical language in the background, all the characters use everyday language. We removed terms like sovereign debt crisis and moral hazard. Brian Cheek our screenwriter kept saying, ‘show it, do not say it.”, if a character has to cry, do not say he is crying, let him walk onto the porch and cry!!!James’s journey from struggling with a mortgage to succeeding in timber trading is a central arc. What message were you hoping to convey about pursuing financial independence through real assets?Every character in “Money Game” has an Arc. James starts out in healthcare being oppressed by his boss (Chris Owen from American Pie). He ends up buying a house in Maine and starting a lumber business as real asset prices explode higher. Professor Garnder starts out teaching class at a community college, but ends up doing a podcast with millions of listeners.Notice that both characters choose NOT to play the current money game. Also notice the tagline for Money Game on the poster, “Don’t Get Played”. The entire globe is getting “played” by the FED to provide the financing for US business, there is no return from cash flow.“Who here is willing to give me $152 ($1/.66%) if I give you $1 for the rest of your life?” --- Professor Gardner.“Hell no, we would all be dead by the time we broke even.” – First Day, student community college.“Correct!!” – Professor Gardner.The film suggests that investing in real assets can help protect investors from the broken financial ecosystem. What role do you see storytelling playing in educating audiences about these economic alternatives?We are living in the biggest groupthink in financial markets history that markets are “efficient” and prices are set by “people”. But the reality is that when the FED intervened in markets, the entire system shifted to machines that DO NOT think. No one is setting prices anymore. The entire system is a policy tool of the FED now. Markets no longer “predict” anything, they ONLY “react” to Fed liquidity. “No one picks their own stocks anymore, the lions (active managers) have been eaten. It’s just a bunch of followers (quant) following followers (passive), it’s like a cat chasing its tail.” --- Professor Gardner. Professor Gardner raises the book,“The Efficient Markets Thesis”,  he tosses it aside and laughs:"Smart people thought the world was flat once too." -- Professor Gardner. He then raises – Death by money: The Story of the Great German inflation and says: “Some of the most underused books in finance are history books.” To me, it’s a certainty that the USD (G7) will collapse, because the more the FED prints, the more the system misallocates resources and the slower the growth in the real economy. Notice that the system rewards companies that issue shares every Quarter. Why? Because in a 100% passive world, like today, if a company issue shares, then the passive are forced to buy more shares at the Quarter to match the index.—-- Let’s Ask , how a 100% passive investing system would allocate capital,Yes, in a 100% passive stock market, the dynamics you’ve described could lead to companies like Tesla—those frequently issuing new shares to finance growth-outperforming, while also driving market inefficiencies that undermine core principles of capitalism. Let’s break it down:Outperformance of Companies Needing FinancingMechanics of Passive Investing: In a fully passive market, funds buy shares of companies issuing new equity to maintain index weightings, as discussed previously. Companies like Tesla, which have historically issued shares to fund ambitious growth (e.g., factory expansions, R&D), would receive consistent capital inflows from passive funds, boosting their mcap and index weight. Performance Feedback Loop: As these companies’ stock prices rise due to passive buying, they attract more capital from performance-chasing investors (even in a passive system, some investors might allocate based on historical returns). This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: share issuance → passive buying → price appreciation → more investor interest → higher market cap → larger index weight → more passive buying. —- Moral Hazard “Because the system is a game now, James. Success in the current system requires speculation, and I will not speculate with other people’s money.” --- Professor Gardner, Money Game ‘25Professor Gardner says, “Capitalism requires risk to allocate resources. By removing risks, the Fed destroyed the capitalism ecosystem.” How does the film illustrate this critique of the Fed’s policies?Capitalism requires risk to allocate resources is the theme of Money Game. Investors should be using real interest rates (interest rates - inflation) to value a business. And today real rates are negative. Real inflation is over 4%, which means real rates are negative.Wealth Effect - Value of a $1 Annuity Interest rates have an enormous effect on asset values. Below is the simplest example in finance, the value of a $1 annuity in perpetuity at different interest rate levels: 10% --> $1/10% = $10 5% --> $1/5%   = $20 1% --> $1/1%   = $10 -1% --> $1/-1%  = Infinite Question: How can the value of a $1 annuity be infinite? Answer: The Price of Money is Wrong. It’s a “financing” system, NOT an “investing” system.  There is no return from cash flow. ‘When interest rates go negative (real terms), all assets are worth infinite, my coffee is worth infinite, my desk is worth infinite, my whiteboard infinite. Does this make sense?” --- Professor Gardner.But when you remove risk from an ecosystem, the ecosystem changes. It's not capitalism anymore, it’s a centrally planned economy.“But here is the problem, capitalism requires risk to allocate scarce resources. Let me give you an example, what would happen if we removed the lions from the Savannah?”“The gazelle population (passive)  would explode higher.” – James.“But then they would be competing for scarce water resources (inflation) and die off.” – Aimee. “Correct, and when the FED intervened in bonds markets, they broke the ecosystem of capitalism.” – Professor Gardner.Why did Professor Gardner describe cash, bonds, etc. as a massive bubble?Good Question!! The $37T in US debt is unpayable in real terms. It’s 7x tax revenue!! So now the FED is manipulating bond rates to keep the stock market (tax receipts) artificially high. Central banks are not buying gold at all-time highs by accident, they buy when trust breaks silently - before it shatters publicly. In a sovereign debt crisis “$1.4B Fartcoin is what you get when the "risk free" asset underpinning the entire banking & currency system is a bond issued by an insolvent govt w/debt of 7x revenues, off-bal sheet liabs of 20-30x revenues, peacetime deficits of 7% of GDP, that has not run a surplus in 24 yrs” – Luke Gromen on X.“The US is 4% of the world’s population, but makes 40% of the world’s budget deficit, 60% of the world’s current account deficit.”-- Louis Gave"That means that to keep the show on the road, the US has to attract, year in and year out, roughly between half and two thirds of the world's marginal increase in savings. If that money that the savings between roughly, let's say two thirds of the world's savings don't float to the US every year, then you're either going to have a problem with the debt or a problem in the US dollar, and maybe we're there." -- Louis Gave Over 30% of the Russell 3000 are zombie corps that lose money like BA, MSTR, CRWD etc.“History is that which always surprises those who tried to deceive it.” José Ortega y Gasset“The history of money is the history of trust in symbols. From Rome’s debased denarius to England’s tally sticks, from the gold promises of Genoa to Nixon’s final severing in 1971 - every system of settlement eventually dissolved into memory. Today, programmable money and digital assets function as new tally sticks. They carry liquidity, but not final settlement. And increasingly, digital capital is flowing East, where alternative rails are being built. The enduring question is not whether this system will end, but what foundation of trust will define the next one.” –Petro Golovko, PHDHow do you hope Money Game influences viewers’ perspectives on the fiat system and their own financial decisions in today’s economy?“Gold is money, everything else is credit”, J.P. Morgan, 1912“If everybody indexed, the only word you could use is chaos, catastrophe… the markets would fail.” - Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard 5/6/17 – Bloomberg., Closing Quote Money Game ‘25\
We want people to start thinking again. Stop trusting the “experts”. No one cares more about your money than you!!. The experts do not take a loss, if you lose money. That’s moral hazard. James, the film’s reluctant hero, isn’t just asking Bryson, “How does your company make money?” He’s asking the audience: “How long will you tolerate a system built on lies?” – Petro Golovko."A collapse of the dollar system is a RETURN to capitalism; the global economy will BOOM higher. The income equality gap will close, wages will escalate, homeowners will break the chains of debt and the system will stop pouring $Trillions into bad (money losing) investments (GME, AMC, PLTR, NVDA, TSLA, Dogecoin, NFTs).After the credits roll, you will see a lion appear, that’s you taking responsibility for your own investments again.  It’s you thinking.“Imagine re-introducing a pride of lions (thinkers, capitalists) back into the Savannah after the Gazelle population (index funds, central planning) exploded 10x and were thirsty and weak? The lions would make a killing." The system is currently broken, so a collapse of the system fixes it.  It’s a return to capitalism. Notice that James was under a lot of stress throughout the movie. But at the end of Money Game, he falls in love and the world seems right again. It’s a happy ending!Everyone should see Bryson, CEO of TAPIT in Money Game, like all the billionaires like Mark Zuckerburg, Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey.  They all believe that their companies are trading at infinite because of them. But that’s NOT the reason. Their companies trade at infinite because interest rates are negative."A collapse of the dollar system is a RETURN to capitalism; the global economy will BOOM higher. The income equality gap will close, wages will escalate, homeowners will break the chains of debt and the system will stop pouring $Trillions into bad (money losing) investments (GME, AMC, PLTR, NVDA, TSLA, Dogecoin, NFTs)."Watching the gazelle population (passive, quant) explode by 10x is not a sign that the ecosystem is flourishing, it's a sign that the ecosystem is broken."The entire globe is watching the scoreboard, and no one noticed the players are no longer scoring." There has never been a better time to think. Invest for yourself.  No one else is looking out for you.  Know the assets that you own and what you are paying for them.“Once you understand that markets are broken, you are holding a crystal ball.” –Executive Producer, Money Game.Take back your investments from all the experts that think markets are “efficient”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review - You&apos;re Pretty Good</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Tamoor Hussain</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1587/15875866/4551551-mg1.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 07:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There's a good chance that, at some point in your life, you've been so enamored of a piece of media that you've considered what it'd be like to experience it for the first time again. Watching Terminator 2, hearing Enter the Wu-Tang, and reading The Dark Knight Returns shaped who I am and, as a result, I remember the moments I experienced them with crystal clarity. Over time, however, those memories have become divorced from the emotions they stirred and what's left in their place is a longing for those lost feelings.Video games are the only medium that I think are capable of making that first-time-again fantasy a reality--or as close to one as we're going to get. Time puts distance between us and the emotionally significant moments we cherish, but it also brings us closer to exciting technologies that can make the old feel new. In the right hands, those technologies can create opportunities to stoke those profound emotions again, even if it's just a little. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater does exactly that.Before getting into what's new, what can't be overlooked in making Delta such a good game is the fact that Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater remains a compelling, well-told story that has strong characterization and deals with some heavy subject matter. It approaches this with a strange mixture of self-seriousness and complete irreverence that is uniquely Metal Gear Solid and, for my money, balances both parts better than any other entry in the series. The stellar stealth is supported by systems that feed into the fantasy of surviving in the jungle and braving the elements, whether that be hunting for food or patching yourself up after sustaining injuries. Delta replicates it and, in my opinion, is better for it. The excellent work that the original Metal Gear Solid 3 dev team did remains the heart and soul of Delta, and it continues to shine.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI announces New Delhi office as it expands footprint in India</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-announces-new-delhi-office-as-it-expands-footprint-in-india/</link><author>Jagmeet Singh</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 06:06:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI has started hiring in India as it looks to expand its presence in the fast-growing South Asian tech market.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top Secret: Automatically filter sensitive information</title><link>https://thoughtbot.com/blog/top-secret</link><author>thunderbong</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 04:48:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What happens when you’re dealing with free text?

numbers or emails), but that won’t capture everything, since not all sensitive
information can be captured with a regex.Fortunately, named-entity recognition (NER) can be used to identify and
classify real-world objects, such as a person, or location. Tools like MITIE
Ruby make interfacing with NER models trivial.By using a combination of regex patterns and NER entities, Top Secret
effectively filters sensitive information from free text—here are some
real-world examples.If you want to see Top Secret in action, you might enjoy this live
stream. Otherwise, see the examples below.It’s not uncommon to send user data to chatbots. Since the data might be
free-form, we should be diligent about filtering it using the approach mentioned
above.However, it’s likely we’ll want to “restore” the filtered values when returning
a response from the chatbot. Top Secret returns a mapping that would
allow for this.The exchange might look something like this.Caller sends filtered text"Hi [PERSON_1]! How is the weather in [LOCATION_1] today?"
Caller can “restore” from the mapping
    Filtering conversation history
  When working with conversation state you should filter  message
before including it in the request. This ensures no sensitive data slips through
from previous messages. Here’s what that might look like.Top Secret can also be used as a validation tool to prevent storing sensitive
information in your database.If the validation is too strict, you can override or disable any of
the filters as needed. class Message < ApplicationRecord
   private
   def content_cannot_contain_sensitive_information
     return if result.mapping.empty?
     errors.add(:content, "contains the following sensitive information #{result.mapping.values.to_sentence}")
It’s our responsibility to protect user data. This is more important than ever
given the rise in popularity of chatbots and LLMs. Tools like Top Secret aim to
reduce this burden.We've been helping engineering teams deliver exceptional products for over 20 years.

Many people in the Linux community are frustrated by the fact that these anti-cheat solutions are stopping them from playing their favorite games. It also doesn’t help that some are fear-mongering about kernel-level anti-cheat solutions and spreading misinformation.In this article, I want to give you a high-level overview of how modern anti-cheat solutions work (which will hopefully be understandable even for non-technical people) and then explain why anti-cheat solutions in their current state just cannot work on Linux, as well as what the alternatives are.What is a videogame cheat? We could talk for hours about whether all sorts of macros and exploits should be considered cheats, but the main thing that comes to people’s minds when talking about multiplayer games is an external program that somehow manipulates the game or reads information from the game to provide you with an advantage over others. A prime example of this would be a wallhack or aimbot.There are generally two ways you can go about this:() Have a completely separate process that copies memory between itself and the game.() Force the game to load a DLL file (a shared library file containing code) directly into the game, executing custom code from within the game.Unless you find some very niche way to load a DLL into the game, in both cases you will need the ability to read (and write) the game’s process memory.If you are not a programmer (or you are a JavaScript developer), you most likely don’t really know how memory management works on modern systems. Let’s imagine this situation: two programs are loaded in memory. What is stopping one program from directly accessing the memory of the other program?Virtual address space in Windows (source).While in the past it would have been perfectly possible to read (almost) any of the physical memory installed in the computer, nowadays OSes use virtual address spaces. I don’t want to go into the details of how this is handled, but all you need to know is that each program is isolated in its own address space and cannot access other programs’ memory unless it uses functions provided by the operating system itself, like  and .In order to use those two functions, you will need to open a handle to the process you want to read or write memory from. This handle will be specific to your process and represent the access rights that you have relative to the object it represents (in this case, the game process). Remember this for later, as it will be important.Modern anti-cheat solutions have three main goals:Block other processes from accessing the game’s memory whenever possible.Detect and ban anyone who tries to get around the blocking mentioned above.Once someone is banned, ensure that they cannot simply create a new game account and continue playing (HWID bans).This is usually achieved by multiple components working together. Let’s take a look at Easy Anti-Cheat as an example:Loader (usually  or )Game library ( and “invisible” module)Service ()Kernel-mode driver ()Without a kernel-mode driver, there is no way to  block memory access into the game. With the kernel-mode driver, though, it’s incredibly simple. All that the driver needs to do is register a callback for handle creation, filter out requests to open such handles to the game process, check the requested permissions, and if they allow memory access, either deny the request or lower the permissions. That way, no usermode process can now read or write the games memory. Same can be applied to module loading and file system access.Using open-source Cheat Engine to try to read protected game’s memory (all reads fail).So how can anyone get around it? They also  need to get their code into the kernel, which will open many ways for them to access the game memory.Notice how I highlighted “somehow”? That’s because Windows is a closed system where Microsoft has the control to decide who should get access to the kernel. All official kernel components are signed with Microsoft code signing certificates, so it’s trivial to verify their authenticity. All 3rd party drivers need to be signed with an EV code signing certificate (which can only be bought by companies) and then go through the Hardware Developer Center certification so they can even be loaded. I am not saying this is perfect; in fact, I will most likely be writing an article about how bad actors are still getting their stuff certified. However, when they do, it usually gets quickly revoked, and it’s so costly and complicated that most don’t even bother trying.There is, of course, a way to get around it by using all sorts of exploits or by using vulnerable drivers (drivers that expose a programming interface to user-mode processes without any checks in place, which allows them to escalate their privileges and possibly even manipulate kernel components). This is where the second goal defined above comes in. The anti-cheat has to actively scan the system and try to find code that is not associated with any legitimate module (a module that was loaded properly, with all certs in place) and other modifications or patches that would otherwise not be there.While most gamers are going to say that those anti-cheats are useless and that they see cheaters left and right, the truth is that they add a huge skill check, so not everyone is able to write a cheat and then not get banned. In fact, if done properly, the cheating problem can be basically eliminated this way (I’ll get to this later).Another reason to run in the kernel is HWID (hardware identifier) banning (the 3rd point mentioned above). If a player is banned and creates a new account, playing on the same hardware will result in an immediate ban. Since the anti-cheat has a kernel component, it can directly talk to the hardware and read its serials that way. If it was running only as a user-mode process, it would be trivial to fake the serial reads. I am not personally a big fan of this since, as you can imagine, it can result in all sorts of unintended issues (people buying used hardware), but in reality, it’s not really a problem since those HWID bans usually expire after a few months (the game devs won’t tell you this though 😉).If I had to pick a game which handles cheating the best, then as of now in my humble opinion it would be Valorant by Riot Games. Keep in mind the stuff that you’ve just read and let me explain:The anti-cheat is loaded on boot. While scary for some, this allows them to block/detect the previously mentioned vulnerable drivers and exploits. This raises the skill required to write a cheat for the game even higher (usually, people resort to bootkits).The kernel driver then doesn’t do anything apart from logging (locally). When the game is actually started, it goes through those logs and figures out if the game launch should be allowed or not and does all the kernel protection stuff mentioned above.More advanced methods to obtain HWID are used, such as reading TPM EK, which is very hard to spoof properly.But that’s not all. If that was all there was to it, other anti-cheats would be just as effective. The anti-cheat team closely works with the game development team as well. How? The anti-cheat introduces extra protection for certain memory regions of the game. Some game data are encrypted, and the encryption keys change with every (even small) game update, making it really annoying for cheat developers. On top of all that, the team is very active in the cheating communities to get intel about what they are up to.I have played Valorant quite extensively, all the way from Silver to Ascendant, and I have yet to meet a cheater.There are two main concerns that people have with those kernel-mode anti-cheats:They are in the kernel doing in-depth scans; therefore, they must be vulnerable and a security issue.They are so deep in the system (and some start on system boot) that they can spy on us without us noticing.Let me ask you a question. How many vulnerable drivers (yes, those that can be abused by bad actors to gain kernel access) do you think the average gamer has on their Windows install? I’ll start with my own system. This is what I can immediately think of:If I looked hard enough, I would most likely find more.It would be really stupid of me to just point to random crap you could have on your computer and say “you have so much exploitable stuff, don’t even bother with security,” and that’s not what I am trying to say. Or maybe it is, but just a little bit… What I am trying to say is that there are many ways a malicious actor could do bad stuff with your system, but anti-cheat is very unlikely to have anything to do with it. In fact, I personally trust those anti-cheat developers much more than random vendors, since they are going to be very well aware of the possible abuse.Overall, the Windows driver ecosystem is a mess, but unfortunately, that is not going to change any time soon.As someone who is very well versed in Windows internals, I can tell you one thing, it doesn’t make sense. If you give the program administrative permissions (at least once), it can spy on you in the same way a kernel-mode driver could. There is absolutely no difference and it’s significantly easier to just write a standalone program. There are people who don’t want to play games because of their connection to Tencent (for example), but if it wasn’t for the kernel-mode anti-cheat, they would have no problem with it. Isn’t it a bit hypocritical? If the game company wanted to spy on you, they could have done so from the game process or the service they have most likely installed for DRM purposes.Oh and just by the way, the vast majority of the data networked by those previously mentioned anti-cheats to their respective servers comes from their usermode component. The only thing that’s sent “by the kernel component” (in quotes since the usermode service requests the data from the driver and then networks it, drivers cannot directly network data) is the HWID mentioned multiple times above and then detections (something that’s out of the ordinary). There is really not some magic data grabbing happening that’s only possible in the kernel.Another thing that is sometimes mentioned is that since it’s in the kernel, it would be harder for security researchers to debug and assess the possible spying. While technically true that it’s harder, it’s definitely not impossible or problematic for an experienced person, so trust me, security researchers and  the entire cheating community keep a close eye on it, in the same way they do on the usermode components.Congratulations, you have successfully made it. You have read all of the stuff and now we can finally get to the Linux part of this post 🎉.As you can probably already tell by the extensive rant above, I don’t have much good news. Linux is an open system. There is no central authority like on Windows that would tell you what you can and what you cannot do in the kernel. This obviously has countless advantages and it’s why so many people (and big corporations) love it, but is also the reason why anti-cheats cannot really function like they do on Windows.There is no way for them to block or detect memory access into the game. Anything you could think of would just not work. Kernel module? Just recompile the kernel and change the functions it uses to hide the possible cheat and bypass all checks. Mandatory kernel patch? Same thing. What about usermode detections? Just run the game in a fakeroot environment while the cheat runs with real root privileges, being hidden from the game completely… Mandatory custom kernel build? Entire Linux system dedicated to the anti-cheat? I mean… that could work, but at that point, you can just install Windows.There have been attempts to get anti-cheat to work on Linux. Easy Anti-Cheat is the most prominent one. Developers can choose whether they want to allow it to run on Linux or not. Linux gamers look at this and use it as an argument that anti-cheat on Linux does not face any issues, but the truth is that apart from the most basic sanity checks, EAC does absolutely nothing on Linux. It’s just a simple module that facilitates the server connection and data encryption/decryption for the game.One of the games that allowed EAC to run under Wine/Proton is Apex Legends. I won’t be putting any links here, but if you search GitHub for cheats for this game, you will find many that work on Linux and there is absolutely no anti-cheat bypass required. It just works.As mentioned above, if you want to achieve the best results, you need to utilize both the  and  measures. Active being the kernel component on Windows blocking memory access and trying to find possible discrepancies. Passive being the code virtualization, obfuscation, game data encryption as well as proper game networking and server-sided checks.An example of how  to utilize kernel-mode anti-cheat would be Fall Guys (yes, that’s the game that one friend made you buy just so you could play it for 30 minutes and then never open again). This game is very specific. There would be no gain in having some sort of wallhack, there would be no gain in having any sort of aimbot (you don’t aim at stuff). All that people did was speedhacking and modifying the game in a way that allowed them to jump higher and generally change their movement. This game is a prime example of why you should write your network code properly. If the game had proper networking and server checks in place (tick-based system, actions performed on both the client and server, if there is a mismatch, the server is the authority and resets the player - that’s how CS:GO did it, and that’s why people were not flying over the map in that game or speedhacking, it had other issues though), there would be no need for anti-cheat. Not even a usermode one. Instead, they fixed absolutely nothing from their side and slapped Easy Anti-Cheat on top of their game.While it’s not really possible to do any of the previously mentioned active measures, there is nothing stopping you from utilizing the passive ones. So, if you are a game developer and want to limit cheating in your game on Linux:Write proper networking code, verify data sent by the client so your game server does not blindly accept mach 8 as a walking speed.Use code obfuscation and virtualization as much as possible (be aware of the performance penalty, be smart about what parts of the code you protect), try to change it a bit with every update (commercial bin2bin obfuscators like VMProtect or Themida will produce different results on each run).If you have control over the game engine itself, try to keep sensitive information on the stack as much as possible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI lawyers question Meta’s role in Elon Musk’s $97B takeover bid</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/openai-lawyers-question-metas-role-in-elon-musks-97b-takeover-bid/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:31:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI says that Elon Musk met with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to discuss a $97 billion takeover bid of the ChatGPT-maker.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Emperor Nero</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/emperor-nero</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68a46682411aa254d337e458/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=cWkYqXcHYBpbYwl0e6wuaZDHVaWb_TQ9Fa-m0LZiopc" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Emperor Nero has gone down in history as the archetypal bad ruler - cruel, decadent, and perhaps even responsible for setting Rome ablaze.

Laughter is both contagious and a social behavior: people laugh 30 times more often in company. The documentary shows how neuroscience and psychology have discovered that humor makes us stronger.

In London, neuroscientist Sophie Scott has dedicated herself to researching laughter. "Laughter plays an important role in building and maintaining social relationships. It reduces stress and relaxes us. It is an important behavior to understand," she says.  This is why laughter is also interesting for psychology. A research team at the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt is exploring how humor can help in psychotherapy. Humor strengthens the relationship between therapists and patients, which can actually reduce symptoms.

Others have also discovered the positive interpersonal effect for themselves: the "Humor hilft heilen" ("humor helps to heal”) foundation, founded by German doctor and TV presenter Eckart von Hirschhausen, conducts workshops in hospitals, among other places. Humor trainers teach nursing staff how to cope better with the everyday demands of their jobs. It's not about constantly cracking jokes. Rather, it’s about lightening interactions between nursing staff and patients.

The industry has evolved significantly from its notoriously scammy origins, having much higher standards and using more flexible points-based systems. Executives say the bait-and-switch days are behind timeshares and have rebranded them as “vacation clubs,” offering a wide range of accommodations and experiences. But there are still issues and scams to look out for when getting into a timeshare. WSJ explores how timeshares became a $35.7 billion dollar industry, how they work and how issues still persist in the industry.

Whereas those games so often put you in the role of a poor farmer or some other position of struggle, Discounty does the opposite, having you effectively play as the bad guys in Stardew Valley: the outsider that has everything and is trying to weasel into the community. You're not literally playing a mirror of that game's story, but it's awfully close--instead of being the new farmer in a small, struggling town, you're instead the new owner of the big-brand supermarket that's attempting to monopolize the economy and push out existing vendors to increase your profit margins. It altogether makes for a game that is fun to play (in that hypnotic sort of way that's recognizable in so many games that romanticize retail work), but it is ultimately quite uncomfortable at times and too muddled in its storytelling to utilize that discomfort to deliver a compelling message.Granted, you're merely the pawn in the palm of the hand of a much greedier capitalist: your aunt. Roped into moving to her small harbor town of Blomkest to help out with her struggling market, you arrive to find she's sold out to the Discounty chain and rebranded. Your aunt is immediately portrayed as a suspicious person, keeping secrets locked away in sheds, making backroom deals with banks, and firing employees without a second thought. It's all in the name of expanding her supermarket business empire, and you're her most loyal pawn, charming locals into going along with your expansions and acquiring their wares so that citizens have to go to Discounty to buy food and home supplies.It feels scummy, especially since your character has zero backbone, pushing the buck on responsibility and ignoring the consequences of their actions for a big chunk of the game's story, which primarily deals with a hurting community that needs healing.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stephen Wolfram on Universal Computation: Revolutionizing the World | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQWZQid_ylg</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WQWZQid_ylg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How does complexity emerge from simplicity? In this interview, Stephen Wolfram explores the concept of universal computation and how simple rules can generate intricate, seemingly random patterns. This perspective challenges traditional views of complexity in physics, biology, and beyond, revealing deep insights into the computational universe.

From the foundations of cellular automata to the discovery of surprising patterns in nature, Wolfram shows how computation reshapes our understanding of reality and revolutionizes the way we think about science.

Finnish sauna, Roman balneae, Japanese onsen, and Indigenous American sweat lodges are just a few examples of how cultures across the globe have long considered exposure to extreme temperatures therapeutic. But today scientists are only just beginning to unravel how and why this may be the case. So, what exactly is happening in your body when you feel the heat? Max G. Levy investigates.

The critter darted into the road, and I tried to evade them, but I failed.They died. It devastated me.I called my wife, physically shaking and tearful, to tell her what happened. I sat in my car for a bit when I got to my destination, needing to regain my composure. Though I knew my intent was pure, I found it hard to accept that I had taken their life away. To no one's surprise, if you're familiar with my work, I saw them not as "roadkill," but as a being with their own interests and goals, however simple those may seem compared to those of humans. It wasn't an ideal starting point for heading into Herdling, a game about trying to guide a family of vulnerable animals out of the city and return them safely to their natural habitat. But I'm sure, even on a normal day, Herdling was going to connect with me deeply on account of its moving depictions of human-animal kindness and companionship.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AWS CEO says using AI to replace junior staff is &apos;Dumbest thing I&apos;ve ever heard&apos;</title><link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/21/aws_ceo_entry_level_jobs_opinion/</link><author>JustExAWS</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:53:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has suggested firing junior workers because AI can do their jobs is "the dumbest thing I've ever heard."Garman made that remark in conversation with AI investor Matthew Berman, during which he talked up AWS’s Kiro AI-assisted coding tool and said he's encountered business leaders who think AI tools "can replace all of our junior people in our company."That notion led to the “dumbest thing I've ever heard” quote, followed by a justification that junior staff are “probably the least expensive employees you have” and also the most engaged with AI tools.“How's that going to work when ten years in the future you have no one that has learned anything,” he asked. “My view is you absolutely want to keep hiring kids out of college and teaching them the right ways to go build software and decompose problems and think about it, just as much as you ever have.”Naturally he thinks AI – and Kiro, natch – can help with that education.Garman is also not keen on another idea about AI – measuring its value by what percentage of code it contributes at an organization.“It’s a silly metric,” he said, because while organizations can use AI to write “infinitely more lines of code” it could be bad code.“Often times fewer lines of code is way better than more lines of code,” he observed. “So I'm never really sure why that's the exciting metric that people like to brag about.”That said, he’s seen data that suggests over 80 percent of AWS’s developers use AI in some way.“Sometimes it's writing unit tests, sometimes it's helping write documentation, sometimes it's writing code, sometimes it's kind of an agentic workflow” in which developers collaborate with AI agents.Garman said usage of AI tools by AWS developers increases every week.The CEO also offered some career advice for the AI age, suggesting that kids these days need to learn how to learn – and not just learn specific skills.“I think the skills that should be emphasized are how do you think for yourself? How do you develop critical reasoning for solving problems? How do you develop creativity? How do you develop a learning mindset that you're going to go learn to do the next thing?”Garman thinks that approach is necessary because technological development is now so rapid it’s no longer sensible to expect that studying narrow skills can sustain a career for 30 years. He wants educators to instead teach “how do you think and how do you decompose problems”, and thinks kids who acquire those skills will thrive. ®]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Compute Runtime 25.31.34666.3 Continues Prepping For Panther Lake</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-CR-25.31.34666.3</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:35:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Released minutes ago was the newest monthly feature release to the Intel Compute Runtime providing open-source OpenCL and Level Zero capabilities on Intel graphics hardware...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Using Common Lisp from Inside the Browser</title><link>https://turtleware.eu/posts/Using-Common-Lisp-from-inside-the-Browser.html</link><author>jackdaniel</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:08:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Written on 2025-08-21 by Daniel Kochmański Web Embeddable Common Lisp is a project that brings Common Lisp and the Web
Browser environments together. In this post I'll outline the current progress of
the project and provide some technical details, including current caveats and
future plans.It is important to note that this is not a release and none of the described
APIs and functionalities is considered to be stable. Things are still changing
and I'm not accepting bug reports for the time being.The easiest way to use Common Lisp on a website is to include WECL and insert
script tags with a type "text/common-lisp". When the attribute src is present,
then first the runtime loads the script from that url, and then it executes the
node body. For example create and run this HTML document from localhost:<!doctype html>

We may use Common Lisp that can call to JavaScript, and register callbacks to be
called on specified events. The source code of the script can be found here:Because the runtime is included as a script, the browser will usually cache the
~10MB WebAssembly module.The initial foreign function interface has numerous macros defining wrappers
that may be used from Common Lisp or passed to JavaScript.Summary of currently available operators: an inlined expression, like  an object referenced from the object store a function a method of the argument, like  a slot reader of the argument a slot writer of the first argument combines define-js-getter and define-js-setter template for JavaScript expressions Common Lisp function reference callable from JavaScript anonymous Common Lisp function reference (for closures)Summary of argument types:Common Lisp object referenceJavaScript object referenceAll operators, except for  have a similar lambda list:(DEFINE-JS NAME-AND-OPTIONS [ARGUMENTS [,@BODY]])The first argument is a list  that is common to all
defining operators: Common Lisp symbol denoting the object a string denoting the JavaScript expression, i.e "innerText" a type of the object returned by executing the expression(define-js-variable ([document] :js-expr "document" :type :symbol))
;; document
(define-js-object ([body] :js-expr "document.body" :type :js-ref))
;; wecl_ensure_object(document.body) /* -> id   */
;; wecl_search_object(id)            /* -> node */
The difference between a variable and an object in JS-FFI is that variable
expression is executed each time when the object is used (the expression is
inlined), while the object expression is executed only once and the result is
stored in the object store.The second argument is a list of pairs . Names will be used in the
lambda list of the operator callable from Common Lisp, while types will be used
to coerce arguments to the type expected by JavaScript.(define-js-function (parse-float :js-expr "parseFloat" :type :js-ref)
    ((value :string)))
;; parseFloat(value)

(define-js-method (add-event-listener :js-expr "addEventListener" :type :null)
    ((self :js-ref)
     (name :string)
     (fun :js-ref)))
;; self.addEventListener(name, fun)

(define-js-getter (get-inner-text :js-expr "innerText" :type :string)
    ((self :js-ref)))
;; self.innerText

(define-js-setter (set-inner-text :js-expr "innerText" :type :string)
    ((self :js-ref)
     (new :string)))
;; self.innerText = new

(define-js-accessor (inner-text :js-expr "innerText" :type :string)
    ((self :js-ref)
     (new :string)))
;; self.innerText
;; self.innerText = new

(define-js-script (document :js-expr "~a.forEach(~a)" :type :js-ref)
    ((nodes :js-ref)
     (callb :object)))
;; nodes.forEach(callb)
The third argument is specific to callbacks, where we define Common Lisp body of
the callback. Argument types are used to coerce values from JavaScript to Common
Lisp.(define-js-callback (print-node :type :object)
    ((elt :js-ref)
     (nth :fixnum)
     (seq :js-ref))
  (format t "Node ~2d: ~a~%" nth elt))

(let ((start 0))
  (add-event-listener *my-elt* "click"
                      (lambda-js-callback :null ((event :js-ref)) ;closure!
                        (incf start)
                        (setf (inner-text *my-elt*)
                              (format nil "Hello World! ~a" start)))
Note that callbacks are a bit different, because  does not
accept  option and  has unique lambda list. It is
important for callbacks to have an exact arity as they are called with, because
JS-FFI does not implement variable number of arguments yet.Callbacks can be referred by name with an operator .While working on FFI I've decided to write an adapter for SLIME/SWANK that will
allow interacting with WECL from Emacs. The principle is simple: we connect with
a websocket to Emacs that is listening on the specified port (i.e on localhost).
This adapter uses the library  written by Andrew Hyatt.It allows for compiling individual forms with , but file compilation
does not work (because files reside on a different "host"). REPL interaction
works as expected, as well as SLDB. The connection may occasionally be unstable,
and until Common Lisp call returns, the whole page is blocked. Notably waiting
for new requests is not a blocking operation from the JavaScript perspective,
because it is an asynchronous operation.;;; Patches for SLIME 2.31 (to be removed after the patch is merged).
;;; It is assumed that SLIME is already loaded into Emacs.

This example shows an important limitation –  does not allow for
multiple asynchronous contexts in the same thread. That means that if Lisp call
doesn't return (i.e because it waits for input in a loop), then we can't execute
other Common Lisp statements from elsewhere because the application will crash.Here's another example. It is more a cool gimmick than anything else, but let's
try it. Open a console on this very website (on firefox C-S-i) and execute:function inject_js(url) {
    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    head.appendChild(script);
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        script.onload = resolve;
        script.src = url;
    });
}

function inject_cl() {
    wecl_eval('(wecl/impl::js-load-slug "https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821")');
}

inject_js('https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/boot.js')
    .then(() => {
        wecl_init_hooks.push(inject_cl);
        inject_js('https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/wecl-20250821/wecl.js');
    });
With this, assuming that you've kept your LIME server open, you'll have a REPL
onto uncooperative website. Now we can fool around with queries and changes:(define-js-accessor (title :js-expr "title" :type :string)
  ((self :js-ref)
   (title :string)))

(define-js-accessor (background :js-expr "body.style.backgroundColor" :type :string)
  ((self :js-ref)
   (background :string)))

(setf (title [document]) "Write in Lisp!")
(setf (background [document]) "#aaffaa")
The first thing to address is the lack of threading primitives. Native threads
can be implemented with web workers, but then our GC wouldn't know how to stop
the world to clean up. Another option is to use cooperative threads, but that
also won't work, because Emscripten doesn't support independent asynchronous
contexts, nor ECL is ready for that yet.I plan to address both issues simultaneously in the second stage of the project
when I port the runtime to WASI. We'll be able to use browser's GC, so running
in multiple web workers should not be a problem anymore. Unwinding and rewinding
the stack will require tinkering with ASYNCIFY and I have somewhat working green
threads implementation in place, so I will finish it and upstream in ECL.Currently I'm focusing mostly on having things working, so JS and CL interop is
brittle and often relies on evaluating expressions, trampolining and coercing.
That impacts the performance in a significant way. Moreover all loaded scripts
are compiled with a one-pass compiler, so the result bytecode is not optimized.There is no support for loading cross-compiled files onto the runtime, not to
mention that it is not possible to precompile systems with ASDF definitions.JS-FFI requires more work to allow for defining functions with variable number
of arguments and with optional arguments. There is no dynamic coercion of
JavaScript exceptions to Common Lisp conditions, but it is planned.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I Created the most Comprehensive LLD Interview Resource</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/launching-premium-lld-resource</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1bdf8340-7a0f-42e0-8609-c5174fb17828_2048x1426.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Dev - Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s one of the most comprehensive and high quality resource you can find online with support for 5 programming languages — Java, Python, C++, C#, and TypeScript.Many chapters are .

Analysts at Morgan Stanley warned this week that the pay surge may “dilute shareholder value without any clear innovation gains”.Concerns about AI progress have been amplified by the modest response to GPT-5, the much-anticipated new version of ChatGPT.Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has compared hype around AI to the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Was It Even Possible To Shoot Down A B-29?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HQm1MFZ9sA8</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HQm1MFZ9sA8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 11:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Panthor Open-Source Driver To Support Many More Arm Mali GPUs In Linux 6.18</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Panthor-More-Arm-Mali-Linux-618</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:27:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The open-source Panthor Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver providing the modern kernel graphics driver support for recent Arm Mali GPUs will be supporting a number of additional GPU models with the Linux 6.18 kernel later this year...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NVIDIA Begins Linux Kernel Upstreaming Work For Their Vera Rubin NLV144 Platform</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-VR144NVL-BMC</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 10:17:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The first Linux kernel patches specific to their next-gen Vera Rubin NLV144 "VR144NVL" were posted today to the public Linux kernel mailing list...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>RADV Vulkan Video Lands Intra-Refresh Encode</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-Intra-Refresh-Video</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:58:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[David Rosca who started out as a contractor for AMD working on their open-source video encode/decode capabilities for Linux formally joined the company earlier this summer.

Example: Ask "how has my project evolved?" and it uses git diff to show actual changes in understanding, not just similarity scores.This is very much a PoC - rough edges everywhere, not production ready. But it's been working surprisingly well for personal use. The entire index for a year of conversations fits in ~100MB RAM with sub-second retrieval.The cool part: You can git checkout to any point in time and see exactly what the AI knew then. Perfect reproducibility, human-readable storage, and you can manually edit memories if needed.Stack: Python, GitPython, rank-bm25, OpenRouter for LLM orchestration. MIT licensed.Would love feedback on the approach. Is this crazy or clever? What am I missing that will bite me later?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CNL: Network-level and Identity-based Observability with Calico Open Source</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7RUzvXr7Vg</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/P7RUzvXr7Vg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 04:55:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't let your Kubernetes environment be a mystery! Gain the visibility you need to keep things running smoothly. This session dives into why network observability is key in Kubernetes, and includes a live demo showing how to identify misconfigurations, simplify troubleshooting, streamline overall network management, and safely implement and test network security policies across any Kubernetes environment.

Here's what we'll explore:

* Why network observability is important (hint: Kubernetes can be a bit chaotic! )
* How observability is the foundation for zero trust security
* Common customer pain points: Troubleshooting, incorrect policies, compliance, and audits
* Calico Whisker: What it is and how it provides that crucial bird's-eye view

The conflict between Rudolph and Ottokar had been building for five years, representing a final showdown between two powerful rulers who could not coexist. Rudolph's victory marked a turning point in European power dynamics, establishing the Habsburgs as a dominant dynasty with lasting political impact, particularly in Central Europe. Despite the enormous scale of the battle, few traces have been found, but archaeologists hope modern technology will unveil more details.

Most of the tools I tried felt heavy, tricky to set up, or produced results that didn’t look great, so I wanted something lightweight, modern, and fast. PlutoPrint is built on top of PlutoBook’s rendering engine, which is designed for paged media, and then wrapped with a Python API that makes it easy to turn HTML or XML into crisp PDFs and PNGs. I’ve used it for things like invoices, reports, tickets, and even snapshots, and it can also integrate with Matplotlib to render charts directly into documents.I’d be glad to hear what you think. If you’ve ever had to wrestle with generating PDFs or images from HTML, I hope this feels like a smoother option. Feedback, ideas, or even just impressions are all very welcome, and I’d love to learn how PlutoPrint could be more useful for you.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alex Gómez-Marín - Can AI Become Conscious?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAUGIqoM74s</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GAUGIqoM74s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 19:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like us on Facebook for daily videos, updates, announcements, and much more: https://shorturl.at/tak4l

Many of them are now discovering that their past is a lie. International adoptions are at the center of an unprecedented scandal.

This scandal is far-reaching. It involves children stolen from their mothers during the Pinochet dictatorship, as well as people described as Africa's "fake orphans”. The film follows investigative journalists, activists and researchers in South Korea, Sweden, France, Chile, Germany and Switzerland. How was this huge, lucrative market able to flourish? And why does it still exist today?

Even today, women are manipulated, threatened or deceived into giving up their babies - often with the blessing of state authorities. The fraudulent practices persist despite the Hague Convention, which has governed international adoption since 1993. That is because the system is flawed and encourages corruption.

In many cases, these practices come to light mainly due to pressure from adopted children who have grown into adults. After discovering the dubious conditions of their adoptions, they begin to search for their birth parents and demand explanations. These searches are often easier to conduct these days, thanks to social media, the Internet and the availability of genealogy websites.

My friends Matthew, Jake and I are building Luminal (https://luminalai.com/), a GPU compiler for automatically generating fast GPU kernels for AI models. It uses search-based compilation to achieve high performance.We take high level model code, like you'd have in PyTorch, and generate very fast GPU code. We do that without using LLMs or AI - rather, we pose it as a search problem. Our compiler builds a search space, generates millions of possible kernels, and then searches through it to minimize runtime.You can try out a demo in `demos/matmul` on mac to see how Luminal takes a naive operation, represented in our IR of 12 simple operations, and compiles it to an optimized, tensor-core enabled Metal kernel. Here’s a video showing how: https://youtu.be/P2oNR8zxSAAOur approach differs significantly from traditional ML libraries in that we ahead-of-time compile everything, generate a large search space of logically-equivalent kernels, and search through it to find the fastest kernels. This allows us to leverage the Bitter Lesson to discover complex optimizations like Flash Attention entirely automatically without needing manual heuristics. The best rule is no rule, the best heuristic is no heuristic, just search everything.We’re working on bringing CUDA support up to parity with Metal, adding more flexibility to the search space, adding full-model examples (like Llama), and adding very exotic hardware backends.We aim to radically simplify the ML ecosystem while improving performance and hardware utilization. Please check out our repo: https://github.com/luminal-ai/luminal and I’d love to hear your thoughts!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>We&apos;ve Never Seen a Comet Do This</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsTuti1ezpc</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WsTuti1ezpc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 16:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comet 29P keeps exploding, and scientists are trying to figure out why.

Between Jupiter and Neptune lurks Centaur 29P, an icy comet that won't stop exploding. Its wild cryovolcanic outbursts can make it flare 300 times brighter in a matter of hours, but the reason for these random eruptions has long been a mystery. Now, recent discoveries from the James Webb Telescope have provided a clue to the secret trigger powering the chaos. Join us as we investigate the strange case of the solar system's most explosive comet.

What are the classical arguments used to prove the existence of God? For the Cosmological Argument we argue First Cause; from the Ontological Argument we argue Necessary Being; from Teleology we argue Design and Purpose. All are refuted and in turn defended in what seems to be a philosophical arms race. In the end, no one believes in God because of arguments, but they do help to develop our thinking about God.

the Linux kernel?I’ve started running into more sites recently that deploy Anubis, a sort of hybrid
art project slash network countermeasure. The project “weighs the souls”
of HTTP requests to help protect the web from AI crawlers.If you’ve seen anime catgirl avatars when visiting a new website,
that’s Anubis.I’m sympathetic to the cause – I host this blog on a single core
128MB VPS, I can tell you some stories about aggressive crawlers!Anubis recently started blocking how I access git.kernel.org and lore.kernel.org. Those sites host the
Linux Kernel Mailing
List archive and the kernel git repositories. As far as I know I do
have a soul, I just wasn’t using a desktop browser… so how exactly is my
soul being weighed?Note: Linux has Tux 🐧, OpenBSD has Puffy 🐡, SuSE has Geeko 🦎 and
Microsoft has Bob 🤓… nothing wrong with mascots! 😸The traditional solution to blocking nuisance crawlers is to use a
combination of rate limiting and
CAPTCHAs. The
CAPTCHA forces vistors to solve a problem designed to be very difficult
for computers but trivial for humans. This isn’t perfect of course, we
can debate the accessibility tradeoffs and weaknesses, but conceptually
the idea makes some sense.Anubis – confusingly – inverts this idea. It insists visitors solve a
problem trivial for computers, but impossible for humans. Visitors are
asked to brute force a value that when appended to a challenge string,
causes it’s SHA-256 to begin with a few zero nibbles.If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s similar to how bitcoin
mining works. Anubis is not literally mining cryptocurrency, but it
 similar in concept to other projects that do exactly that,
perhaps most famously Coinhive
and JSECoin.So how do some useless SHA-256 operations prove you’re not a bot? The
argument goes that this simply makes it too expensive to crawl your
website.This… makes no sense to me. Almost by definition, an AI vendor will
have a datacenter full of compute capacity. It feels like this solution
has the problem backwards, effectively only limiting access to those
 resources or trying to conserve them.Let’s assume the argument has some merit and math out the claims.We can see that with the default Anubis configuration, a typical
website visitor will have to solve a challenge with a difficulty of
4.This means that a visitor must make the first 4 hex digits of the
challenge hash be zero, so 16 bits (4 digits, one nibble each).
Therefore, you can expect to mine a suitable  within
2^16 SHA-256 operations.If every single github star on the anubis project represents a
website that has deployed Anubis, how much would the cloud services bill
be to mine enough tokens to crawl every single website?At the time of writing, Anubis has 11,508 github stars.The default configuration means mining one token gets you access for
7 days (although I think this expiration check is broken, see
below), so we need 11,508 * 2^16 SHA-256 operations per week,
how expensive is that?To get some numbers, I started an  vm on Google
Compute Engine, and ran . This is what you get

if we used both SMT sibling cores. This amount of compute is simply too
cheap to even be worth billing for.So (11508 websites * 2^16 sha256 operations) / 2^21, that’s about 6
minutes to mine enough tokens for every single Anubis deployment in the
world. That means the cost of unrestricted crawler access to the
internet for a week is approximately $0.In fact, I don’t think we reach a single cent per month in compute
costs until several million sites have deployed Anubis.I’m just not convinced this math works… this is 
nothing for a souless AI vendor with a monthly cloud services budget in
the 8 figures. However, the cost for real soul-owning humans with
limited access to compute is high – the Anubis forums are full of
complaints like these:Anubis cites hashcash
as the primary inspiration for their design, an anti-spam solution from
the 90s that was never widely adopted.The idea of “weighing souls” reminded me of another anti-spam
solution from the 90s… believe it or not, there was once a company that
used poetry to block spam!Habeas
would license short haikus to companies to embed in email headers. They
would then aggressively sue anyone who reproduced their poetry without
a license. The idea was you can safely deliver any email with their
header, because it was too legally risky to use it in spam.winter into spring  brightly anticipated So you’re trying to read LKML, but catgirl says no… is there a
solution?My issue is I don’t want to use a desktop browser to mine the
required value, so how can I get the auth cookie?If we look at the response with , we can see the
challenge in the HTTP headers:$ curl -I https://lore.kernel.org/

a quick C program to mine an acceptable token:Let’s run that and see what it says…$ gcc -Ofast -march=native anubis-miner.c -lcrypto -o anubis-miner

that into a cookie file for , etc.Interestingly, sending the same request the next day got me a new
signed cookie!?This seems like a bug – exchanging a mined token for an auth cookie
should immediately remove the challenge from the store, or there is a double spend
vulnerability.This error benefits me, I have to mine less tokens, but I’ll open an
issue 😇Update: wow, fixed just a
few minutes after opening an issue by the maintainer!This dance to get access is just a minor annoyance for me, but I
question how it proves I’m not a bot. These steps can be trivially and
cheaply automated.I think the end result is just an internet resource I need is a
little harder to access, and we have to waste a small amount of
energy.I wrote this article with my own puny brain, I didn’t use any AI. I
know there are  (they’re 
emdashes!) – I have a habit of writing two consecutive dashes, which pandoc
converts into U+2013.This post is a bit critical of a small well-intentioned project, so
I felt obliged to email the maintainer to discuss it before posting it
online. I didn’t hear back.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Reason The Allies Won WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwWDIfgkaH4</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FwWDIfgkaH4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:47:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video takes an in depth look at the Second World War, the biggest conflict in human history.

But first, let’s see how to position and move objects in 3D space.In 3D space, we position objects by setting its coordinates along three axes: x,y, and z.The x-axis typically represents horizontal movement—left or right.The y-axis typically represents vertical movement—up or down.The z-axis typically represents depth—forward or backwardTo move an object in 3D space, we can use mathematical functions to set its position over time.For example, this cube's x position is set to 10 * cos(πt/2), where t is time (in seconds).The result? It oscillates from 10 to -10 along the x-axis every 2 seconds, following a cosine wave.Similarly, setting the y position to 10 * cos(πt/2) makes the cube oscillates vertically, from 10 to -10 every 2 seconds.We can create a two-dimensional path by setting the x and y positions to different functions.For this circle, the x position is set to 10 * cos(πt/2).The cube starts at x = 10, moves to -10 in 2 seconds, then back to 10, and so on.Meanwhile, the y position is set to 10 * sin(πt/2).The movement for x and y may look similar, but they are actually out of phase.When x = 10, y = 0; when x = 0, y = 10; and so on.Together, these two functions create a circular path for the cube.Now we can get creative with functions to create even more complex paths.For example, let's multiply the x function by 0.03 * t.It would make the cube oscillates farther on the x-axis over time...and we will have a circular path whose radius grows over time.Okay, now it's time to talk about the spherical helix (finally!)The spherical helix path is similar to the spiral we just made, but with some differences.First, a spherical helix is three-dimensional.It has a z component that changes over time.This cube's z position is set as 10 * cos(0.02 * πt).It will start from z = 10 then slowly move to -10.Second, unlike the previous spiral, the x and y positions don’t grow indefinitely.They grow at first, then shrink halfway through.This is because the x function is multiplied by another sine function: sin(0.02 * πt)which makes the radius larger in the middle and smaller at the ends.The same is also done to the y function.Together, these functions create a spherical helix.By updating the cube’s position with these functions, it moves along a spherical helix path.In summary, we can move objects in 3D space by defining their x, y, z coordinates as functions of time.These functions, which express x, y, z coordinates as a function of another variable (in this case, time), are called parametric equations.Check out the Wikipedia article for more on parametric equations.Now that we know this, we can get creative and move objects along any path we want!...to this complex, chaotic path......which we know now isn't actually chaotic.It's just a path defined by mathematical functions.Thanks for sticking with me, I hope you enjoyed it!visualrambling.space is a personal project by Damar, someone who loves to learn about different topics and rambling about them visually.If you like this, please consider following me on Twitter and sharing this with your friends.I'm planning to write more articles like this, so stay tuned!https://twitter.com/damarberlari]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Russia Will Own and Operate Turkey’s First Nuclear Plant</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dmWdXjSdeic</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dmWdXjSdeic?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:01:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russia is financing, building, and operating Turkey’s first nuclear plant—a $25 billion project.

Their flagship AI product, Copilot (in all its various forms), allows people to utilize AI in their daily work to interact with Microsoft services and generally perform tasks. Unfortunately, this also creates a wide range of new security problems.On July 4th, I came across a problem in M365 Copilot: Sometimes it would access a file and return the information, but the audit log would not reflect that. Upon testing further, I discovered that I could simply ask Copilot to behave in that manner, and it would. That made it possible to access a file without leaving a trace. Given the problems that creates, both for security and legal compliance, I immediately reported it to Microsoft through their MSRC portal.Helpfully, Microsoft provides a clear guide on what to expect when reporting vulnerabilities to them. Less helpfully, they didn’t follow that guide at all. The entire process has been a mess. And while they did fix the issue, classifying this issue as an ‘important’ vulnerability, they also decided not to notify customers or publicize that this happened. What that means is that your audit log is wrong, and Microsoft doesn’t plan on telling you that.This post is split into three parts. The first part explains the Copilot vulnerability and the problems it can cause. The second part outlines how Microsoft handled the case. And the third part discusses Microsoft’s decision not to publish this information, and why I consider that to be a huge disservice to Microsoft’s customers.The Vulnerability: Copilot and Audit LoggingThe vulnerability here is extremely simple. Normally, if you ask M365 Copilot to summarize a file for you, it will give you a summary and the audit log will show that Copilot accessed that file on your behalf.[1]That’s good. Audit logs are important. Imagine someone downloaded a bunch of files before leaving your company to start a competitor; you’d want some record of that, and it would be bad if the person could use Copilot to go undetected.[2] Or maybe your company has sensitive personal data, and you need a strict log of who accessed those files for legal and compliance purposes; again, you’d need to know about access that occurred via Copilot. That’s just two examples. Organizations rely on having an accurate audit log.But what happens if you ask Copilot to not provide you with a link to the file it summarized? Well, in that case, the audit log is empty.Just like that, your audit log is wrong. For a malicious insider, avoiding detection is as simple as asking Copilot.[3]You might be thinking, “Yikes, but I guess not too many people figured that out, so it’s probably fine.” Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. When I found this, I wasn’t searching for ways to break the audit log. Instead, I was simply trying to trigger the audit log so I could test functionality we are developing at Pistachio, and I noticed it was unreliable. In other words, this can happen by chance.[4] So if your organization has M365 Copilot licenses, your audit log is probably wrong. It turns out that Michael Bargury, the CTO at Zenity, found this a year ago and disclosed it, and Microsoft still didn’t fix it (hence my report). He gave a really good talk on the topic, amongst other bad AI stuff. The relevant part is here.I had never reported a vulnerability to Microsoft before, and my initial reaction to the process was fairly positive. The fact that I could submit something already felt unusually friendly by Microsoft’s standards. And like I mentioned, they even had a guide on what to expect.Unfortunately, nothing went according to plan. On July 7th my report’s status was changed to “reproducing”, but when I went to provide more evidence on July 10th the functionality had changed. That isn’t Microsoft’s policy; they’re meant to reproduce, then move to “develop” when they start working on a fix. Seeing the functionality change while still in “reproducing” made me think Microsoft was going to get back to me and claim they couldn’t reproduce the issue, when actually they had simply fixed it based on my report.So I asked MSRC what was happening, and instead of responding with a simple explanation, they changed the status of the report to “develop” and said nothing. Up until that point I thought Microsoft was going to follow a process, and coordinate with me if they had to deviate from that. Instead, it felt like the process was less a reflection of what was really happening, and more akin to the Domino’s Pizza Tracker for security researchers. The statuses aren’t real.On August 2nd, Microsoft informed me that a full fix would be released on August 17th, that I would be free to disclose as of August 18th. I then asked when a CVE number would be issued, and I was told:CVEs are given to fixes deployed in security releases when customers need to take action to stay protected. In this case, the mitigation will be automatically pushed to Copilot, where users do not need to manually update the product and a CVE will not be assigned.That is not Microsoft’s policy at all, which I pointed out to them by linking to their own policy. MSRC then wrote back, “I understand you may not have full visibility into how MSRC approaches these cases”, as if I was the wrong one. They then explained that the vulnerability is classified as “important”, not “critical”, and that is why they will not issue a CVE.[5] Of course, they had not told me that they had classified the vulnerability at all prior to that point.Microsoft’s Decision to Say NothingIf Microsoft isn’t issuing a CVE for this vulnerability, how are they going to inform customers about it? The answer is that they’re not going to. On a call on August 14th, Microsoft told me that they had no plans to disclose this.[6]I strongly feel that is wrong. It might be okay to move on silently if this was some esoteric exploit, but the reality is that it is so easy that it basically happens by accident. If you work at an organization that used Copilot prior to August 18th, there is a very real chance that your audit log is incomplete.Do organizations not need to know that? What about companies that are subject to HIPAA and are relying on Microsoft’s audit log to satisfy some of the technical safeguard requirements? Do they not get to know, despite Microsoft claiming M365 Copilot can be HIPAA compliant? There are almost certainly other regulated entities with similar requirements, and they also won’t be told.There are so many cases in which organizations rely on audit logs to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents. There are lawsuits where audit logs are used as important evidence. The US government even made an issue out of Microsoft charging more for audit logs, with a US senator shaming Microsoft and referring to audit logging as an essential security feature.And now Microsoft is saying that even though the audit log was very plausibly wrong for any customer using Copilot, no one needs to know? This raises serious questions about what other problems Microsoft chooses to silently sweep under the rug.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AGENTS.md – Open format for guiding coding agents</title><link>https://agents.md/</link><author>ghuntley</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 00:15:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[- Use  to jump to a package instead of scanning with .- Run  to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.- Use  to spin up a new React + Vite package with TypeScript checks ready.- Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right name—skip the top-level one.- Find the CI plan in the .github/workflows folder.- Run  to run every check defined for that package.- From the package root you can just call .

In this post, we will dive into how Go schedules goroutines, how that scheduling interacts with container-level CPU controls, and how Go can perform better with awareness of container CPU controls.One of Go’s strengths is its built-in and easy-to-use concurrency via goroutines.
From a semantic perspective, goroutines appear very similar to operating system threads, enabling us to write simple, blocking code.
On the other hand, goroutines are more lightweight than operating system threads, making it much cheaper to create and destroy them on the fly.While a Go implementation could map each goroutine to a dedicated operating system thread, Go keeps goroutines lightweight with a runtime scheduler that makes threads fungible.
Any Go-managed thread can run any goroutine, so creating a new goroutine doesn’t require creating a new thread, and waking a goroutine doesn’t necessarily require waking another thread.That said, along with a scheduler comes scheduling questions.
For example, exactly how many threads should we use to run goroutines?
If 1,000 goroutines are runnable, should we schedule them on 1,000 different threads?This is where  comes in.
Semantically,  tells the Go runtime the “available parallelism” that Go should use.
In more concrete terms,  is the maximum number of threads to use for running goroutines at once.So, if  and there are 1,000 runnable goroutines, Go will use 8 threads to run 8 goroutines at a time.
Often, goroutines run for a very short time and then block, at which point Go will switch to running another goroutine on that same thread.
Go will also preempt goroutines that don’t block on their own, ensuring all goroutines get a chance to run.From Go 1.5 through Go 1.24,  defaulted to the total number of CPU cores on the machine.
Note that in this post, “core” more precisely means “logical CPU.”
For example, a machine with 4 physical CPUs with hyperthreading has 8 logical CPUs.This typically makes a good default for “available parallelism” because it naturally matches the available parallelism of the hardware.
That is, if there are 8 cores and Go runs more than 8 threads at a time, the operating system will have to multiplex these threads onto the 8 cores, much like how Go multiplexes goroutines onto threads.
This extra layer of scheduling is not always a problem, but it is unnecessary overhead.Another of Go’s core strengths is the convenience of deploying applications via a container, and managing the number of cores Go uses is especially important when deploying an application within a container orchestration platform.
Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes take a set of machine resources and schedule containers within the available resources based on requested resources.
Packing as many containers as possible within a cluster’s resources requires the platform to be able to predict the resource usage of each scheduled container.
We want Go to adhere to the resource utilization constraints that the container orchestration platform sets.Let’s explore the effects of the  setting in the context of Kubernetes, as an example.
Platforms like Kubernetes provide a mechanism to limit the resources consumed by a container.
Kubernetes has the concept of CPU resource limits, which signal to the underlying operating system how many core resources a specific container or set of containers will be allocated.
Setting a CPU limit translates to the creation of a Linux control group CPU bandwidth limit.Before Go 1.25, Go was unaware of CPU limits set by orchestration platforms.
Instead, it would set  to the number of cores on the machine it was deployed to.
If there was a CPU limit in place, the application may try to use far more CPU than allowed by the limit.
To prevent an application from exceeding its limit, the Linux kernel will throttle the application.Throttling is a blunt mechanism for restricting containers that would otherwise exceed their CPU limit: it completely pauses application execution for the remainder of the throttling period.
The throttling period is typically 100ms, so throttling can cause substantial tail latency impact compared to the softer scheduling multiplexing effects of a lower  setting.
Even if the application never has much parallelism, tasks performed by the Go runtime—such as garbage collection—can still cause CPU spikes that trigger throttling.We want Go to provide efficient and reliable defaults when possible, so in Go 1.25, we have made  take into account its container environment by default.
If a Go process is running inside a container with a CPU limit,  will default to the CPU limit if it is less than the core count.Container orchestration systems may adjust container CPU limits on the fly, so Go 1.25 will also periodically check the CPU limit and adjust  automatically if it changes.Both of these defaults only apply if  is otherwise unspecified.
Setting the  environment variable or calling  continues to behave as before.
The  documentation covers the details of the new behavior.Slightly different modelsBoth  and a container CPU limit place a limit on the maximum amount of CPU the process can use, but their models are subtly different. is a parallelism limit.
If  Go will never run more than 8 goroutines at a time.By contrast, CPU limits are a throughput limit.
That is, they limit the total CPU time used in some period of wall time.
The default period is 100ms.
So an “8 CPU limit” is actually a limit of 800ms of CPU time every 100ms of wall time.This limit could be filled by running 8 threads continuously for the entire 100ms, which is equivalent to .
On the other hand, the limit could also be filled by running 16 threads for 50ms each, with each thread being idle or blocked for the other 50ms.In other words, a CPU limit doesn’t limit the total number of CPUs the container can run on.
It only limits total CPU time.Most applications have fairly consistent CPU usage across 100ms periods, so the new  default is a pretty good match to the CPU limit, and certainly better than the total core count!
However, it is worth noting that particularly spiky workloads may see a latency increase from this change due to  preventing short-lived spikes of additional threads beyond the CPU limit average.In addition, since CPU limits are a throughput limit, they can have a fractional component (e.g., 2.5 CPU).
On the other hand,  must be a positive integer.
Thus, Go must round the limit to a valid  value.
Go always rounds up to enable use of the full CPU limit.Go’s new  default is based on the container’s CPU limit, but container orchestration systems also provide a “CPU request” control.
While the CPU limit specifies the maximum CPU a container may use, the CPU request specifies the minimum CPU guaranteed to be available to the container at all times.It is common to create containers with a CPU request but no CPU limit, as this allows containers to utilize machine CPU resources beyond the CPU request that would otherwise be idle due to lack of load from other containers.
Unfortunately, this means that Go cannot set  based on the CPU request, which would prevent utilization of additional idle resources.Containers with a CPU request are still constrained when exceeding their request if the machine is busy.
The weight-based constraint of exceeding requests is “softer” than the hard period-based throttling of CPU limits, but CPU spikes from high  can still have an adverse impact on application behavior.Should I set a CPU limit?We have learned about the problems caused by having  too high, and that setting a container CPU limit allows Go to automatically set an appropriate , so an obvious next step is to wonder whether all containers should set a CPU limit.While that may be good advice to automatically get a reasonable  defaults, there are many other factors to consider when deciding whether to set a CPU limit, such as prioritizing utilization of idle resources by avoiding limits vs prioritizing predictable latency by setting limits.The worst behaviors from a mismatch between  and effective CPU limits occur when  is significantly higher than the effective CPU limit.
For example, a small container receiving 2 CPUs running on a 128 core machine.
These are the cases where it is most valuable to consider setting an explicit CPU limit, or, alternatively, explicitly setting .Go 1.25 provides more sensible default behavior for many container workloads by setting  based on container CPU limits.
Doing so avoids throttling that can impact tail latency, improves efficiency, and generally tries to ensure Go is production-ready out-of-the-box.
You can get the new defaults simply by setting the Go version to 1.25.0 or higher in your .Thanks to everyone in the community that contributed to the longdiscussions that made this a reality, and in particular to feedback from the maintainers of  from Uber, which has long provided similar behavior to its users.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Colosseum</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-colosseum</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68a34249d8992f54b5da94b1/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=VcFa9qaPf7ixUotvX7baeOzx-H0Sk2F7tgXcw5jC4JI" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join Dan in Rome as he unravels the dramatic story of the Colosseum and the gladiators who fought — and died — for glory.

And I am having a blast. But not everything is perfect. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.This is a short recap after using it for one month on and off (due to repair 😅), and the last 2 weeks full time. I want to share what I learned, what I like about the new setup after working for 15 years plus on a MacBook, and on and off on Windows at work. And maybe what is still a little rough.Getting Ready for the SwitchBefore I could make the switch, I had some pre-requirements I needed to be able to use it as my full-time machine. Here are some: ✅ fuzzy finder in raycast to open up my favorite files or folder, e.g. if I need to open my Offers template folder️✔️ screenshot like Snagit ✅ daylight adjustment like f.lux ✅  next calendar events in top bar❌ one time backup to store files and OS, or only files?And most important, instant workspace navigation. The reason why I was upset with Apple: with the latest update, Yabai didn’t work flawlessly anymore, and also all the updates and constant asking if I want to do this or that got in my way.During that process, I noticed that many things I was having, like Setapp Apps with all the apps like Bartender, VPN, and other apps are nice and useful, but not needed. Or mostly there is a similar, or sometimes even better, alternative out there.While I’m super happy with the switch, here are some direct comparison from apps and workflow from macOS to Linux.
Snagit, my beloved screenshot-taking tool. I haven’t found a similar replacement yet that can cut out in-between the image or store all the captured images in a library. Even OCR search worked out of the box in Snagit, across all my images I took over the years.You’d say, but who needs this? Yeah, kind of, but it’s super handy, especially if you are a blog writer and explain stuff visually—the speed and quick image manipulation is not yet there.. One thing I noticed lately is that sometimes a shortcut breaks, or something is not working anymore. This is also because Omarchy is just brand new, and I’m inexperienced running Linux as my main OS. But for the last 5 years with the M1, hardware-wise, things just worked. I had to replace my full mainboard as the GPU was broken within the first two weeks, so that might be bad luck. But the quality of MacBooks is just another level. I had 3 or 4 so far since 2010, and each of them held at least 5 years. Crazy good.. It’s not the same game anymore. The fan is also mostly running. But that’s one downside I’m willing to accept for a more joyful experience. Also, if I don’t like something on my OS, I just change it. Or if I want to improve a certain way of working, a quick script, a new package, and I’m just flying.. TimeMachine on macOS was great. Gave me peace of mind that if I lose something, I can always recover. I never had to go back file-based, as I have them stored on Sync.com (now with Linux switched to Filen.io), and notes in Obsidian. But when I broke something, or I had to switch MacBooks, one backup, and every little setting was the same. But that’s something I tackle next, so I have peace of mind if I misconfigure something, like yesterday, when I changed the  and I couldn’t log in as sudo anymore 😅 (yeah, don’t ask!). I could fix it again, though. But stuff like this makes me scared that I can run a wrong command and ruin my perfect setup. I need a backup!. As mentioned, I had to switch from Sync to Filen, as Sync didn’t run on Linux. But Filen is great, and I’m super happy with it. I also switched from Lastpass to 1Password, took this as a change. I was also thinking about NextCloud on my home server, but I couldn’t switch everything in one go.. An important one was keyboard shortcuts. I have advanced shortcuts and many different custom keyboards. First I use Karabiner-Elements for the vim navigations with , which will then return arrow keys. This way I can use vim navigations in each app, as arrow keys are supported everywhere. For this I used Kanata on Linux. And use XCompose for simple Umlaut or replacements like  when I write.,  and . I used Raycast for all of these. On Windows Ditto was great for clipboard only. But with Walker (Launcher), that has built-in file search called , and an additional tool called Clipse, I have the same features I needed. Plus more than I ever would have dreamed, because Walker is so customizable that you can add a quick script for everything.WebApps as native apps. Shortcuts for everything. E.g. using Signal, WhatsApp or Figma. Want to change monitor setup from home to office? A shortcut. Want to switch from my mechanical keyboard to the laptop keyboard with different shortcuts? A shortcut. Quickly install a new app? A shortcut. And so on. I never thought that an OS can be customizable to my liking.Even themes you can change across OS, vim, terminal, and background with one shortcut. The sky is the limit, literally.Omarchy: An Opinionated Arch Linux “Distro”Luckily, I didn’t have to set up all myself. In fact, Omarchy, a soon-to-be distro that runs Arch Linux, does most of it out of the box. And it’s keyboard shortcut-oriented, and worked really similar to my macOS workflow already. So after I installed, changed a couple of hotkeys, I was almost at the same speed and utility as on my old MacBook, but without the frustrations. Or I should say, other frustrations :)But huge shoutout to DHH for creating this gem, and making Arch Linux approachable for many developers coming from macOS. After I checked all the scripts and what the community added over time, I saw that so many things were just solved. Screens, function or media keys, cameras, fingerprint reader, printer, and so on, all just worked, almost like on a MacBook.How It Began: Taking the LeapThis was the time working out in the wild with Arch Linux, without bringing my Macbook.
Writing in a coffeeshop with Arch Linux (Omarchy).Some comments from the first days: It’s a blast to work with Hyprland, so fast and smooth. Battery level obviously much less, return of the fan noise when running Electron apps 🙂.What works: Advanced Karabiner keyboard setup, sync files (had to switch to Filen), Obsidian, and my dotfiles with tmux, Neovim and all the good jam.Still to do: Clipboard manager, better Snagit replacement, Raycast search in files/emojis and backup.I’m surprised with what all worked out of the box, like hibernating, external monitors/keyboards, media keys. Not sure how much is thanks to DHH’s Omarchy, and what’s native Arch Linux support, but it’s amazing.I’m working on my dotfiles to port them to Linux on . Lots to configure, but the tools to choose from are endless, and just free and open source. Great world. Thanks to all the people who maintain and create these amazing products.Great experience over the Macbook so far:The  with HyprlandNavigation is flawless, even from local to external screen, I just normally navigate, e.g. just hit  If I’m on the app on my laptop, jumping to the next app on the left, if that is the external screen, it will jump there. On Yabai, external monitors had to have a special keymap.Full screen has  at the top or empty bar like Mac. Normal fullscreen uses all the way and does not open on a random workspace at the end of existing workspacesWhat doesn’t work as well yet, or things I missed in my workflow: overlay which is sometimes handy for Obsidian or any other apps to fix grammar. On Linux I need to copy and paste back and forth again. But on the other hand, it does not secretly send each text to the cloud :)Microsoft /Office that I need for one client has no native app, but the web app works flawlessly.: just sleep and next day come back, everything as it was. Need to shut down to not overheat. (Has been solved in the meantime, but still not the same as MacBook)No  for MCP. Although I used Claude Code most of the time. (I have replaced with a webapp, is almost the same feel, but no MCP I believe. But Claude Code has it now too, and Neovim too :)I could buy cheaper hardware. The downside, the  are coming up quickly, something I am not used to anymore :) I still use a lot of Electron apps (browser, Claude in browser, Obsidian) and other heavy apps such as Google Meet in browser, YouTube.I recorded my macOS workflow () as of now to document it before I potentially switch to Arch Linux with Omarchy. Let’s see 😉However, I also showcase that most of my setup on macOS is very similar to the shortcut-driven Linux setup shown in Omarchy - workflow  (now):Life with Arch Linux (Omarchy)Today I’m almost up with the same tools as before, there are still some to be changed, but that’s expected after 15 years on the same OS. This write-up is the start of showing that. I will soon create another video on Omarchy, and add to this post too.Before I went full in, I quickly tested it on an old (10-20 years) laptop and installed an early version of Omarchy. It is a beauty. Before, Windows was unusable and with Arch in the back, it runs almost like a brand-new laptop. Obviously when you start heavy apps, you will notice too, but the navigation and simple tasks are instant; you don’t feel that you are on an old machine.
Installed on an old laptop. Amazed how blazingly fast it is. And beautuful. I can finally say it, Arch BTW  TwitterObviously, I needed new hardware. First I was romanticizing with the Beelink fanless desktops, super fast and affordable. But as I do my best writing on the go in coffee shops, libraries or on the couch, I needed a laptop.DHH has a great list that I included in Notebook & Desktops for Linux. And as Framework Laptops are not available in Switzerland, I went with an affordable Lenovo ThinkBook. 32 GB and good-looking device with a great keyboard. I didn’t know how good a laptop keyboard can be with some travel; almost can’t write on the MacBook keyboard anymore, even though I didn’t get the bad scissor one.But the CPU is not the fastest, and I didn’t do heavy loads yet. And I can already sense if I run a couple of Electron apps that the CPU can go quite high. Like Obsidian, browser and Spotify, these are already three. And if I open webapps as separate windows, these are essentially more tabs or Electron apps.But yeah, I got to have a matte screen that also works nice outside, and after all, the screen is not the most important thing to me. Also the speaker and trackpad and everything else on the MacBook was just superior, but it doesn’t bother me as much yet. Only the battery life is a big shift back, and the constant fan. Obviously, if I stay for it longer, I might also buy a beefier laptop, I actually didn’t know if I will stay or not. So far, everything is pointing to that I will stay on Linux for the time being. Also nice to see the constant new updates that Omarchy is producing. A breath of fresh air to be honest.I Learned Sooooo much (and Had Fun)The great thing, although I spent quite some time, I learned so much. It’s so fun. As a lover of a good TUI, I really enjoyed every bit of it.It’s also fun to set up your OS in a way that makes you more productive, or gives you joy just by the looks of it. Aesthetics and quick transitions between each keypress or transition are amazing.It’s only 2-3 weeks in total that I run it full time. So there’s many things I want to improve and I will over time. But I’m amazed how much is already working, and that it’s such a blast to use.I’ll update you on the journey for sure. If you don’t want to miss it it, subscribe to my newsletter.

allows swap usage:
a significant shift from the conventional practice of disabling swap for performance predictability.
This article focuses exclusively on tuning swap on Linux nodes, where this feature is available. By allowing Linux nodes to use secondary storage for additional virtual memory when physical RAM is exhausted, node swap support aims to improve resource utilization and reduce out-of-memory (OOM) kills.However, enabling swap is not a "turn-key" solution. The performance and stability of your nodes under memory pressure are critically dependent on a set of Linux kernel parameters. Misconfiguration can lead to performance degradation and interfere with Kubelet's eviction logic.In this blogpost, I'll dive into critical Linux kernel parameters that govern swap behavior. I will explore how these parameters influence Kubernetes workload performance, swap utilization, and crucial eviction mechanisms.
I will present various test results showcasing the impact of different configurations, and share my findings on achieving optimal settings for stable and high-performing Kubernetes clusters.Introduction to Linux swapAt a high level, the Linux kernel manages memory through pages, typically 4KiB in size. When physical memory becomes constrained, the kernel's page replacement algorithm decides which pages to move to swap space. While the exact logic is a sophisticated optimization, this decision-making process is influenced by certain key factors:Page access patterns (how recently pages are accessed)Page dirtyness (whether pages have been modified)Memory pressure (how urgently the system needs free memory)Anonymous vs File-backed memoryIt is important to understand that not all memory pages are the same. The kernel distinguishes between anonymous and file-backed memory.: This is memory that is not backed by a specific file on the disk, such as a program's heap and stack. From the application's perspective this is private memory, and when the kernel needs to reclaim these pages, it must write them to a dedicated swap device.: This memory is backed by a file on a filesystem. This includes a program's executable code, shared libraries, and filesystem caches. When the kernel needs to reclaim these pages, it can simply discard them if they have not been modified ("clean"). If a page has been modified ("dirty"), the kernel must first write the changes back to the file before it can be discarded.While a system without swap can still reclaim clean file-backed pages memory under pressure by dropping them, it has no way to offload anonymous memory. Enabling swap provides this capability, allowing the kernel to move less-frequently accessed memory pages to disk to conserve memory to avoid system OOM kills.Key kernel parameters for swap tuningTo effectively tune swap behavior, Linux provides several kernel parameters that can be managed via .: This is the most well-known parameter. It is a value from 0 to 200 (100 in older kernels) that controls the kernel's preference for swapping anonymous memory pages versus reclaiming file-backed memory pages (page cache).
: The kernel will be aggressive in swapping out less-used anonymous memory to make room for file-cache.: The kernel will strongly prefer dropping file cache pages over swapping anonymous memory.: This parameter tells the kernel to keep a minimum amount of memory free as a buffer. When the amount of free memory drops below the this safety buffer, the kernel starts more aggressively reclaiming pages (swapping, and eventually handling OOM kills).
 It acts as a safety lever to ensure the kernel has enough memory for critical allocation requests that cannot be deferred.: Setting a higher  effectively raises the floor for for free memory, causing the kernel to initiate swap earlier under memory pressure.vm.watermark_scale_factor: This setting controls the gap between different watermarks: ,  and , which are calculated based on .
:
: When free memory is below this mark, the  kernel process wakes up to reclaim pages in the background. This is when a swapping cycle begins.: When free memory hits this minimum level, then aggressive page reclamation will block process allocation. Failing to reclaim pages will cause OOM kills.: Memory reclamation stops once the free memory reaches this level.: A higher  careates a larger buffer between the  and  watermarks. This gives  more time to reclaim memory gradually before the system hits a critical state.In a typical server workload, you might have a long-running process with some memory that becomes 'cold'. A higher  value can free up RAM by swapping out the cold memory, for other active processes that can benefit from keeping their file-cache.Tuning the  and  parameters to move the swapping window early will give more room for  to offload memory to disk and prevent OOM kills during sudden memory spikes.To understand the real-impact of these parameters, I designed a series of stress tests.: GKE on Google Cloud: 1.33.2:  (8GiB RAM, 50GB swap on a  disk, without encryption), Ubuntu 22.04: A custom Go application designed to allocate memory at a configurable rate, generate file-cache pressure, and simulate different memory access patterns (random vs sequential).: A sidecar container capturing system metrics every second.: Critical system components (kubelet, container runtime, sshd) were prevented from swapping by setting  in their respective cgroups.I ran a stress-test pod on nodes with different swappiness settings (0, 60, and 90) and varied the  and  parameters to observe the outcomes under heavy memory allocation and I/O pressure.Visualizing swap in actionThe graph below, from a 100MBps stress test, shows swap in action. As free memory (in the "Memory Usage" plot) decreases, swap usage () and swap-out activity () increase. Critically, as the system relies more on swap, the I/O activity and corresponding wait time ( in the "CPU Usage" plot) also rises, indicating CPU stress.My initial tests with default kernel parameters (, , watermark_scale_factor=10) quickly led to OOM kills and even unexpected node restarts under high memory pressure. With selecting appropriate kernel parameters a good balance in node stability and performance can be achieved.The swappiness parameter directly influences the kernel's choice between reclaiming anonymous memory (swapping) and dropping page cache. To observe this, I ran a test where one pod generated and held file-cache pressure, followed by a second pod allocating anonymous memory at 100MB/s, to observe the kernel preference on reclaim:My findings reveal a clear trade-off:: The kernel proactively swapped out the inactive anonymous memory to keep the file cache. This resulted in high and sustained swap usage and significant I/O activity ("Blocks Out"), which in turn caused spikes in I/O wait on the CPU.: The kernel favored dropping file-cache pages delaying swap consumption. However, it's critical to understand that this does not disable swapping. When memory pressure was high, the kernel still swapped anonymous memory to disk.The choice is workload-dependent. For workloads sensitive to I/O latency, a lower swappiness is preferable. For workloads that rely on a large and frequently accessed file cache, a higher swappiness may be beneficial, provided the underlying disk is fast enough to handle the load.Tuning watermarks to prevent eviction and OOM killsThe most critical challenge I encountered was the interaction between rapid memory allocation and Kubelet's eviction mechanism. When my test pod, which was deliberately configured to overcommit memory, allocated it at a high rate (e.g., 300-500 MBps), the system quickly ran out of free memory.With default watermarks, the buffer for reclamation was too small. Before  could free up enough memory by swapping, the node would hit a critical state, leading to two potential outcomes: If kubelet's eviction manager detected  was below its threshold, it would evict the pod. In some high-rate scenarios, the OOM Killer would activate before eviction could complete, sometimes killing higher priority pods that were not the source of the pressure.To mitigate this I tuned the watermarks:Increased  to 512MiB: This forces the kernel to start reclaiming memory much earlier, providing a larger safety buffer.Increased  to 2000: This widened the gap between the  and  watermarks (from ≈337MB to ≈591MB in my test node's ), effectively increasing the swapping window.This combination gave  a larger operational zone and more time to swap pages to disk during memory spikes, successfully preventing both premature evictions and OOM kills in my test runs.Table compares watermark levels from  (Non-NUMA node): and watermark_scale_factor=10min_free_kbytes=524288KiB and watermark_scale_factor=2000Node 0, zone Normal    pages free 583273    min 10504    high 15756    present 1310720 Node 0, zone Normal    pages free 470539    low 337017    spanned 1310720   managed 1274542The graph below reveals that the kernel buffer size and scaling factor play a crucial role in determining how the system responds to memory load. With the right combination of these parameters, the system can effectively use swap space to avoid eviction and maintain stability.Enabling swap in Kubernetes is a powerful tool, but it comes with risks that must be managed through careful tuning.Risk of performance degradation Swapping is orders of magnitude slower than accessing RAM. If an application's active working set is swapped out, its performance will suffer dramatically due to high I/O wait times (thrashing). Swap could preferably be provisioned with a SSD backed storage to improve performance.Risk of masking memory leaks Swap can hide memory leaks in applications, which might otherwise lead to a quick OOM kill. With swap, a leaky application might slowly degrade node performance over time, making the root cause harder to diagnose.Risk of disabling evictions Kubelet proactively monitors the node for memory-pressure and terminates pods to reclaim the resources. Improper tuning can lead to OOM kills before kubelet has a chance to evict pods gracefully. A properly configured  is essential to ensure kubelet's eviction mechanism remains effective.Together, the kernel watermarks and kubelet eviction threshold create a series of memory pressure zones on a node. The eviction-threshold parameters need to be adjusted to configure Kubernetes managed evictions occur before the OOM kills.As the diagram shows, an ideal configuration will be to create a large enough 'swapping zone' (between  and  watermarks) so that the kernel can handle memory pressure by swapping before available memory drops into the Eviction/Direct Reclaim zone.Based on these findings, I recommend the following as a starting point for Linux nodes with swap enabled. You should benchmark this with your own workloads.: Linux default is a good starting point for general-purpose workloads. However, the ideal value is workload-dependent, and swap-sensitive applications may need more careful tuning.vm.min_free_kbytes=500000 (500MB): Set this to a reasonably high value (e.g., 2-3% of total node memory) to give the node a reasonable safety buffer.vm.watermark_scale_factor=2000: Create a larger window for  to work with, preventing OOM kills during sudden memory allocation spikes.I encourage running benchmark tests with your own workloads in test-environments, when setting up swap for the first time in your Kubernetes cluster. Swap performance can be sensitive to different environment differences such as CPU load, disk type (SSD vs HDD) and I/O patterns.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who likes pineapple on pizza?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Cn-8wT5bMCQ</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Cn-8wT5bMCQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:57:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Neil deGrasse Tyson and cohost Chuck Nice answer fan questions about the shape of the universe, the origin of matter, the Casimir Force, pizza toppings, and more!

What are gluons and gravitons made of? Can a carbon atom orbit a human? Why do aliens always use Earth time in movies? We speculate whether aliens should use Earth time and whether cryopods make sense in relativistic travel.  Could binary star systems support stable planetary orbits?

We explore binary star systems, pizza topping debates, and the shape of the universe. Does the universe curve so that you would loop back to your origin? Neil breaks down time at the speed of light, the crushing gravity of neutron stars, and whether ships could harvest hydrogen from cavitation. Where does matter come from in the Many-Worlds interpretation? Is the entire universe expanding or just the observable part?

What happens if the Milky Way stops spinning? What is the Casimir Force, and why does empty space press metal plates together? If you crunched the asteroid belt into one object, would it even be a planet? We tackle whether time and space could have existed independently before the Big Bang, and close with advice for physics students navigating uncertain science funding.

After the deadly wildfires that raged in 2017, the country developed measures that now serve as a model for other European nations.

André Mota is one of 31,000 volunteer firefighters in Portugal. He was called out on October 15, 2017, when a devastating wildfire reached the town of Santa Comba Dão, where he lives. The experience left a lasting impression on him. Today, he is responsible for civil protection in his home region of Viseu and coordinates prevention measures.
Growing up, Verónica Catarino witnessed wildfires firsthand. Today, she heads up a special training program at the national firefighting school, where she teaches students how meteorological and geographical factors influence wildfires.
Miguel Jerónimo works for the NGO GEOTA, supporting reforestation projects across Portugal. Part of his job involves clearing areas of eucalyptus trees - especially in the southern region of Algarve - and planting native species such as cork oaks, strawberry bushes and chestnut trees, because mixed forests are more resilient against fire.

From managing dynamic permissions to implementing fine-grained access controls, the challenges grow as your requirements and users scale.This  will guide you through the 6 key requirements all authorization layers should include to avoid technical debt:Architectural and design considerations for building a scalable and secure authorization layer.20+ technologies, approaches, and standards to consider for your permission management systems.Practical insights, based on 500+ interviews with engineers, architects, and IAM professionals.Learn how to create an authorization solution that evolves with your business needs, while avoiding technical debt.An HTTP request-response has 2 parts:Header: tiny pieces of metadataA request means the client asks for something. While a response means the server sends back something.An HTTP header consists of a name and a value. Although headers are invisible to the users, they’re important in transferring information. Yet extra headers could consume bandwidth and affect performance. So it’s necessary to use them correctly.And the server sends a status code with each response. It tells the client whether its request succeeded, failed, or needs extra action.He failed the interview, so you don’t have to.Here’s a summary of what he learned:Both requests and responses include these headers.It controls the caching behavior of browsers and intermediary caches. For example, caching in proxy servers and CDN. Put simply, it helps to determine if the browser should serve data from its cache when the user revisits a site.Here are some of its directives:Cache-Control: max-age=3600, publicIt means cache the response in each infrastructure layer for 3600 seconds.It means don’t cache the response anywhere.It means cache the response. But the browser must re-validate with the server before using it.An incorrect configuration of this header might display stale data to the user. Also there’s a risk of storing private data. Besides forgetting to cache static resources, such as images or scripts, affects the performance badly.It indicates when the server sent the response. It’s used to calculate cache freshness and also debug clock issues.Date: Sun, 22 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMTIt means the server sent the response on 22 August 2025 at 14:00 GMT.An incorrect configuration of this header will make the cache freshness calculation wrong. Also it'd make debugging harder.It’s added by proxy servers automatically. And helps to track and debug network routing paths. Put simply, it shows the intermediary servers such as proxies, load balancers, and CDN.Via: 1.1 proxy1.example.com, 1.1 proxy2.example.comIt means the message passed through  and  using HTTP/1.1.So there’s no impact on users if this header is missing. But its absence can make debugging difficult when there are many proxies.The client sends these headers to the server to give information about the client or the request.It contains the hostname and port number of the server receiving the request. Yet it defaults to port 443 for HTTPS if the client specifies nothing. It’s helpful when the server handles different sites via virtual hosting on the same IP address.It means the request is for the blog subdomain (virtual host) on the server.The server might return the default site or a 400 error status code if this header is missing. Put simply, an incorrect header will prevent the request from reaching the correct site.It informs the server about the client’s browser and operating system. It’s useful for analytics, compatibility workarounds, and content optimization (mobile vs desktop).User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36It means the request came from Google Chrome 114 on a 64-bit Windows 10 machine.Some older browsers might receive incompatible content if this header is missing. Also a wrong header might serve incorrect data to the mobile client. Thus affecting performance badly.It informs the server of the content format expected in the response. For example, JSON or HTML.It means the client prefers a JSON response.The server responds with its default format if this header is missing. And the client might fail to process the response. Besides the server responds with a 406 Not Acceptable error code if it doesn’t support the requested format.It informs the server of the human language expected in the response. Put simply, it tells the browser’s language preference. For example, English or German.Accept-Language: en-US, de;q=0.9It means the client prefers content in US English. And prefers German only if it’s unavailable.The server falls back to its default language if this header is missing or wrongly set. Thus affecting user experience.It informs the server of the compression algorithm expected in the response. For example, gzip or deflate. It helps to reduce the response size by compressing it, thus saving bandwidth.Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, brIt means the client can handle responses compressed with gzip, deflate, or brotli (br).The server sends an uncompressed response if this header is missing. Thus affecting performance badly. Also an incorrect header might create a response in the wrong compression format. And the client might fail to decode it.It lets the client send its cookies to the server. Think of a  as a piece of data stored on the browser. It helps to remember things like logins, preferences, or sessions.Cookie: session_id=abc567; theme=darkIt means the client is sending its stored data, such as session ID and theme preference, to the server.The server might start a new session if this header is missing. Thus affecting the user experience badly.It contains the site URL that sent the client to the current page. Put simply, it shows where the request came from. And it’s commonly used in analytics.Referer: https://example.com/page1It means the request came from page1 on example.comThe site traffic analytics might become inaccurate if this header is missing.It lets the client send authentication credentials, such as tokens or API keys. Imagine authentication credentials as a password or token to prove who the client is. So the server can allow it to access specific resources.Authorization: Bearer eyJhbKciOiJmIt means the client is using a Bearer token as proof of identity to access the server. Think of the  as a temporary digital key for access.The server responds with a 401 Unauthorized error code if this header is missing or invalid. While server responds with a 403 Forbidden error code if the client has insufficient permission.It lets the client download specific byte ranges of a file. It’s useful for streaming media or resuming broken downloads.It means the client is telling the server to send only the first 500 bytes of a file.The server sends the entire file on each request if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth.It tells the server to send the resource only if an update occurred on it after a specific period. Put simply, it lets the client make conditional GET requests.If-Modified-Since: Tue, 11 Jun 2024 10:00:00 GMTIt means the client is asking the server to send the resource only if it has changed since 11 June 2024, 10 hours GMT.The server sends a fresh copy every time if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth. While the server responds with 304 Not Modified without a body if the resource hasn’t changed.It tells the server to send the resource only if the client’s ETag doesn’t match the server’s current ETag. Think of  as a unique resource version identifier for a resource. Put simply, it lets the client make conditional GET requests, but much more precisely.It means the client is asking the server to send the resource only if its current ETag differs from The server sends a fresh copy every time if this header is missing. Thus wasting bandwidth and affecting performance.The client doesn't add this header, but the proxy does. It lets the server know the client's IP address even if the request passed through proxies or load balancers. It’s useful for analytics, logging, and rate limiting.X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.21It means the request originally came from the client with IP address 203.0.113.21While the server only sees the proxy or load balancer’s IP address if the header is missing. Thus making rate limiting difficult and analytics less accurate.The proxy or load balancer adds this header.It tells the server the original protocol the client used before the request passed through proxies or load balancers. For example, HTTP or HTTPS.It helps the server to generate correct absolute URLs that match the client’s protocol.It means the original client used HTTPS.The server might return insecure HTTP links to the client if this header is missing.The proxy or load balancer adds this header. It tells the server the original port the client used before the request passed through proxies or load balancers. For example, port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS.It helps the server generate correct absolute URLs for redirects.It means the original client used port 443 (default for HTTPS).The server might return incorrect absolute links to the client if this header is missing.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:The server sends these headers to give instructions to the client.It’s used by the server to redirect the client to a specific URL. For example, the server sends this header after a form submission to tell the browser where the new resource is.Location: https://example.com/welcomeIt means the server is telling the client to redirect to example.com/welcomeThe client might get redirected to a broken URL if this header is wrong. While the client will stay on the same URL if this header is missing.It lets the server store cookies on the client. The client then includes it in future requests. Imagine a  as a small piece of data stored on the client. It allows session management, personalization, and tracking.Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnlyIt means the server is telling the browser to store a session cookie for the entire site and block JavaScript from accessing it.Each request might get treated as a new session if this header is missing. Also there might be security risks or broken logins if this header is wrong.Access-Control-Allow-OriginIt’s the main header for cross-origin requests (). It tells the browser which sites are allowed access to a resource on a specific site. While the browser blocks the response if it's missing.Imagine an e-commerce store that uses an external payment service. The store tries to fetch the payment confirmation from the payment service.Yet browsers have the  It means JavaScript can only read responses from the same site unless the other site allows it. So without CORS, the browser blocks the response. (Even if the request went through successfully.)With CORS enabled, the payment service responds with this header:Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ecommerce-store.comIt means allow store’s JavaScript to read the payment confirmation.And the e-commerce store displays the payment confirmation data. This approach prevents random sites from accessing sensitive data.Think of this header with a real-world analogy:Access-Control-Allow-Origin header = guest list for a partyPayment service = party hostE-commerce store = guest who wants to visit the partyIf the payment service doesn’t have the e-commerce store on the guest list, the browser won’t let it in to see the data.This header is added by a cache, such as the CDN or proxy.It tells how many seconds the response has been in the cache since it was fetched from the origin server. Thus helping the browser decide if the cache is still fresh or needs revalidation.It means the cached copy is 120 seconds old.Each time the cache serves a response, it calculates the age and includes it in the header. The cache freshness is then determined by comparing this header value with the cache-control header.While the client might show stale data to the user if this header is missing.The server sends different responses for the same URL based on request headers. For example, user-agent, accept-encoding, or accept-language. So there are different cache versions for the same URL.This header tells the cache which request headers affect the server’s response. Thus ensuring cache to serve the right version of a resource to different clients.It means the server might send different responses for desktop and mobile users.The cache might serve the wrong version of a site if this header is missing. Thus breaking pages or showing wrong language.It tells the client whether the server supports partial requests. It’s useful for downloading parts of a large media file and for streaming media.It means the server supports partial requests in bytes.The client assumes the server doesn’t support partial requests if this header is missing. Thus downloading the file in full.It indicates which part of a resource is being sent in response to a partial request. This lets the client assemble the resource correctly from different parts.Content-Range: bytes 0-499/1234It means this response contains bytes 0 through 499 of a resource that is 1234 bytes in total.The client won't know the part it received if this header is missing. Thus it might fail to assemble the resource correctly.It tells the browser which sources are allowed for scripts, styles, and images. Thus preventing cross-site scripting () attacks. Think of XSS as a situation where a hacker injects malicious JavaScript into a site to steal data.A hacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the site through a form or comment box. Without this header, the browser runs the script and lets the hacker steal user data.But with this header, the browser loads resources only from trusted sources. Thus blocking malicious scripts.Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'It means the site only allows content and scripts to load from its own domain.The browser checks every resource against these rules and blocks anything not on the allowed list.Strict-Transport-SecurityIt tells the browser to always use HTTPS for this domain for a specific period.Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomainsIt means the browser uses HTTPS only for this site and its subdomains for the next 1 year.First-time visitors to a site might get downgraded to insecure HTTP if this header is missing. Thus making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. So include this header with the maximum age for security.These headers describe the content body of a request or response.It indicates the format of the message body, so the receiver knows how to process it.Content-Type: application/jsonIt means that the body of the message is in JSON format.The client might fail to interpret the content if this header is wrong or missing.It tells the browser how to handle the response body.

However, we needed to fully UNDERSTAND the math behind neural networks to build other modules in our TPU. So before we started writing any code, each of us worked out the math of a simple 2 -> 2 -> 1 multi-layer perceptron (MLP).The reason we chose this specific network is because we were targeting inference and training for the XOR problem (the "hello world" of neural networks). The XOR problem is one of the simplest problems a neural network can solve. All other gates (AND, OR, etc) can predict the outputs from its inputs using just one linear line (one neuron) to separate which inputs correspond to a 0 and which ones correspond to a 1. But to classify all XOR, an MLP is needed, since it requires curved decision boundaries, which can't be achieved with ONLY linear equations. For a geometric and first-principles treatment, the free bookUnderstanding Deep Learningis excellent.Now, say we want to do continuous inference (i.e. self driving car making multiple predictions a second). That would imply that we're sending multiple pieces of data at once. Since data is inherently multidimensional and has many features, we would have matrices with very large dimensions. However, the XOR problem simplifies the dimensions for us, as there are only two features (0 or 1) and 4 possible pieces of input data (four possible binary combinations of 0 and 1). This gives us a 4x2 matrix, where 4 is the number of rows (batch size) and 2 is the number of columns (feature size).The XOR input matrix and target outputs:Each row represents one of the four possible XOR inputs, and the output vector shows the expected XOR resultsAnother simplification we're making for our systolic array example here is that we'll use a 2x2 instead of the 256x256 array used in the TPUv1. However, the math is still faithful so nothing is actually dumbed down, rather scaled down instead.The first step in the equation is multiplying m with x, which, in matrix form, would be.whereis our input matrix,is our weight matrix, andis our bias vectorHow can we perform matrix multiplication in hardware? Well, we can use a unit called the systolic array!The heart of a TPU is a unit called the systolic array.It consists of individual building blocks called Processing Elements (PE) which are connected together in a grid-like structure. Each PE performs a multiply-accumulate operation, meaning it multiplies an incoming input X with a stationary weight Wand adds it to an incoming accumulated sum, all in the same clock cycle. @ or ;

            ;
        ;
        ;
            ;
        Systolic matrix multiplicationWhen these PEs are connected together, they can be used to perform matrix multiplication systolically, meaning multiple elements of the output matrix can be calculated every clock cycle. The inputs enter the systolic array from the left and move to the neighbouring PE to the right, every clock cycle. The accumulated sums start with the multiplication output from the first row of PEs, move downwards, and get added to the products of each successive PE, until they up at the last row of PEs where they become an element of the output matrix.Because of this single unit (and the fact that matrix multiplications dominate the computations performed in models), TPUs can very easily inference and train any model.Now let's walk through the example of our XOR problem:Our systolic array takes two inputs: the input matrix and the weight matrix. For our XOR network, we initialize with the following weights and biases:Input and weight schedulingTo input our input batch within the systolic array, we need to:To input our weight matrix: we need to:Note that the rotating and staggering don't have any mathematical significance — they are simply required to make the systolic array work. The transpoing too is just for mathematical bookkeeping – it's required to make the matrix math work because of how we set up our weight pointers within the neural network drawing.To perform the staggering, we designed near-identical accumulators for the weights and inputs that would sit above and to the left of the systolic array, respectively.Since the activations are fed into the systolic array one-by-one, we thought a first-in-first-out queue (FIFO) would be the optimal data storage option. There was a slight difference between a traditional FIFO and the accumulators we built, however. Our accumulators had 2 input ports — one for writing weights manually to the FIFO and one for writing the previous layer's outputs from the activation modules BACK into the input FIFOs (the previous layer's outputs are inputs for the current layer).We also needed to load the weights in a similar fashion for every layer, so we replicated the logic for the weight FIFOs, without the second port.The next step in the equation is adding the bias. To do this in hardware, we need to create a bias module under each column of the systolic array. We can see that as the sums move out of the last row within the systolic array, we can immediately stream them into our bias modules to compute our pre-activations. We will denote these values with the variable Z.The bias vector  is broadcast across all rows of the matrix — meaning it's added to each row of Now our equation is starting to look a lot like what we've learned in high school –but just in multidimensional form, where each column that streams out of the systolic array represents its own feature!Next we have to apply the activation, for which we chose Leaky ReLU.This is also an element-wise operation, similar to the bias, meaning we need an activation module under every bias module (and by proxy under every column of the systolic array) and we can stream the outputs of our bias modules into the activation modules immediately.We will denote these post-activation values with H.The Leaky ReLU function applies element-wise:where  is our leak factor. For matrices, this applies to each element independently.For our XOR example, let's see how Layer 1 processes the data. First, the systolic array computes:Finally, LeakyReLU is applied element-wise:Negative values are multiplied by 0.5, positive values pass through unchanged.Now you might be asking – why don't we merge the bias term and the activation term in one clock cycle? Well, this is because of something called pipelining! Pipelining allows multiple operations to be executed simultaneously across different stages of the TPU —instead of waiting for one complete operation to finish before starting the next, you break the work into stages that can overlap. Think of it like an assembly line: while one worker (activation module) processes a part, the previous worker (bias module) is already working on the next part. This keeps all of the modules busy rather than having them sit idle waiting for the previous stage to complete. It also affects the speed at which we can run our TPU — if we have one module that tries to squeeze many operations in a single cycle, our clock speed will be bottlenecked by that module, as the other modules can only run as fast as that single module. Therefore, it's efficient and best practice to split up operations into individual clock cycles as much as possible.Another mechanism we used to run our chip as efficiently as possible, was a propagating "start" signal, which we called a travelling chip enable (denoted by the purple dot). Because everything in our design was staggered, we realized that we could very elegantly assert a start signal for a single clock cycle at the first accumulator and have it propagate to neighbouring modules exactly when they needed to be turned on.This would extend into the systolic array and eventually the bias and activation modules, where neighbouring PEs and modules, moving from the top left to the bottom right, were turned on in consecutive clock cycles. This ensured that every module was only performing computations when it was required to and wasn't wasting power in the background.Now, we know that starting a new layer means we must compute the same  using a new weight matrix. How can we do this if our systolic array is weight-stationary? How can we change the weights?While thinking about this problem, we came across the idea of double buffering, which originates from video games. The reason why double buffering exists is to prevent something called screen tearing on your monitor. Ultimately, pixels take time to load and we'd like to "hide away" that time somehow. And if you paid attention, this is the exact same problem we're currently facing with the systolic array. Fortunately, video game designers have already come up with a solution for this problem. By adding a second "shadow" buffer, which holds the weights of the next layer while the current layer is being computed on, we can load in new weights during computation, cutting the total clock cycle count in half.To make this work, we also needed to add some signals to move the data. First, we needed a signal to indicate when to switch the weights in the shadow buffer and the active buffer. We called this signal the "switch" signal (denoted by the blue dot) and it copied the values in the shadow buffer to the active buffer. It propagated from the top left of the systolic array to the bottom right (the same path as the travelling chip enable, but only within the systolic array). We then needed one more signal to indicate when we wanted to move the weights down by one row and we called this the "accept" flag (denoted by the green dot) because each row is ACCEPTING a new set of weights. This would move the new weights into the top row of the systolic array, as well as each row of weights down into the next row of the systolic array. These two control flags worked in tandem to make our double buffering mechanism work.If you haven't already noticed, this allows the systolic array to do something powerful…continuous inference!!! We can continuously stream in new weights and inputs and compute forward pass for as many layers as we want. This touches into a core design philosophy of the systolic array: we want to maximize PE usage.We always want to keep the systolic array fed!For Layer 2, the outputs from Layer 1 () now become our inputs:Adding bias and applying activation:All values are positive, so they pass through unchanged. These are our final predictions for the XOR problem!Our final step for inference was making a control unit to use a custom instruction set (ISA) to assert all of our control flags and load data through a data bus. Including the data bus, our ISA was 24 bits long and it made our testbench more elegant as we could pass a single string of bits every clock cycle, rather than individually setting multiple flags.We then put everything together and got inference completely working! This was a big milestone for us and we were very proud about what we had accomplished.Backpropagation and trainingOk we've solved inference — but what about training? Well here's the beauty: We can use the same architecture we use for inference for training! Why? Because training is just matrix multiplications with a few extra steps.Here's where things get really exciting. Let's say we just ran inference on the XOR problem and got a prediction that looks something like [0.8, 0.3, 0.1, 0.9] when we actually wanted [1, 0, 0, 1]. Our model is performing poorly! We need to make it better. This is where training comes in. We're going to use something called a loss function to tell our model exactly how poorly it's doing. For simplicity, we chose Mean Squared Error (MSE) — think of it like measuring the "distance" between what we predicted and what we actually wanted, just like how you might measure how far off target your basketball shot was.Let's denote the loss with L.where  is the target output, is our prediction, and is the number of samplesFor our XOR example, with predictionsand targets :This loss value tells us how far off our predictions are from the true XOR outputs.So right after we finish computing our final layer's activations (let's call them), we immediately stream them into a loss module to calculate just how bad our predictions are. These loss modules sit right below our activation modules, and we only use them when we've reached our final layer. But here's the key insight: you don't actually need to calculate the loss value itself to train. You just need its derivative. Why? Because that derivative tells us which direction to adjust our weights to make the loss smaller. It's like having a compass that points toward "better performance."The magic of the chain ruleThis is where calculus enters the picture. To make our model better, we need to figure out how changing each weight affects our loss. The chain rule lets us break this massive calculation into smaller, manageable pieces.The chain rule for gradients:This allows us to compute gradients layer by layer, propagating them backwards through the networkLet's naively trace through what happens step by step.Calculate- how much the loss changes with respect to our final activations.Computeby taking the derivative of the activation (leaky ReLU in our case).Compute,ComputeRinse and repeat for the n-1 layer.Propagating gradients to the hidden layer:And through the first layer's activation:With mixed positive and negative values in, the gradient is:Once we have all of these individual derivatives, we can multiply them together to find any derivative with respect of the loss (i.e.gives us).After that, we have to compute the activation derivative, for which the formula is. This is also an element-wise computation, meaning we can structure it exactly like the loss module (and bias and activation modules), but it will perform a different calculation. One important note about this module, however, is that it requires the activations we computed during forward pass.Now you might be wondering — how do we actually compute derivatives in hardware? Let's look at Leaky ReLU as an example, since it's beautifully simple but demonstrates the key principles. Remember that Leaky ReLU applies different operations based on whether the input is positive or negative. The derivative follows the same pattern: it outputs 1 for positive inputs and a small constant (we used 0.01) for negative inputs. @;
    .01 ;
    What's beautiful about this is that it's just a simple comparison – no complex arithmetic needed. The hardware can compute this derivative in a single clock cycle, keeping our pipeline flowing smoothly. This same principle applies to other activation functions: their derivatives often simplify to basic operations that hardware can execute very efficiently.You'll notice a really cool pattern emerging: all these modules that sit underneath the systolic array process column vectors that stream out one by one. This gave us the idea to unify them into something we called a vector processing unit (VPU) – because that's exactly what they're doing, processing vectors element-wise!Not only is this more elegant to work with, it's also useful when we scale our TPU beyond a 2x2 systolic array, as we'll have N number of these modules (N being the size of the systolic array), each of which we would have to interface with individually. Unifying these modules under a parent module makes our design more scalable and elegant!Additionally, by incorporating control signals for each module, which we call the VPU pathway bits, we can selectively enable or skip specific operations. This makes the VPU flexible enough to support both inference and training. For instance, during the forward pass, we want to apply biases and activations but skip computing loss or activation derivatives. When transitioning to the backward pass, all modules are engaged, but within the backward chain we only need to compute the activation derivative. Due to pipelining, all values that flow through the VPU pass through each of the four modules, and any unused modules simply act as registers, forwarding their inputs to outputs without performing computation.The next few derivatives are interesting because we can actually use matrix multiplication (and the systolic array!) to compute the derivatives with the help of these three identities:If we haveand take its derivative with respect to the weights, we get:If we haveand take its derivative with respect to the inputs, we get:(just the weight matrix transposed)For the bias term, the derivative is simply 1.This means that we can multiply the previouswith ,, and 1 to get,, and, respectively, and we can multiply all of these byto get the gradients of the loss with respect to all of our second layer parameters. And because all of the gradients are actually gradient matrices, we can use the systolic array!Now something to note about the activation derivativeand the weight derivativeis that they both require the post-activations (H) we calculate during forward pass. This means we need to store the outputs of every layer in some form of memory to be able to perform training. Here's where we created a new scratchpad memory modulewhich we called the unified buffer (UB).This lets us store our H values immediately after we compute them during forward pass.We realized that we can also get rid of the input and weight accumulators, as well as manually loading the bias and leak factors into their respective modules, by using the UB to store them. This is also better practice, rather than loading in new data every clock cycle with the instruction set. Since we want to access two values (2 inputs or 2 weights for each row/col of the systolic array) at the same time, we added TWO read and write ports. We did this for each data primitive (inputs, weights, bias, leak factor, post activations) to minimize data contention since we have many different types of data.To read values, we supply a starting address and the number of locations we want the UB to read and it will read 2 values every clock cycle. Writing is a similar mechanism, where we specify which values we want to write to each of the two input ports. The beauty in the read mechanism is that it runs in the background once we supply a starting address until the number of locations given are read, meaning we only need to provide an instruction for this every few clock cycles.At the end of the day, not having these mechanisms wouldn't break the TPU — but they allow us to always keep the systolic array fed, which is a core design principle we couldn't compromise.While we were working on this, we realized we could make one last small optimization for the activation derivative module — since we only use the  values once (for computing), we created a tiny cache within the VPU instead of storing them in the UB. The rest of the  values will be stored in the UB because they're needed to compute multiple derivatives.This is what the new TPU architecture, modified to perform training, looks like:Now we can do backpropagation!The beautiful symmetry of forward and backward passGoing back to the computational graph, we discovered something remarkable: the longest chain in backpropagation closely resembles forward pass! In forward pass, we multiply activation matrices with transposed weight matrices. In backward pass, we multiply gradient matrices with weight matrices (untransposed). It's like looking in a mirror!This insight led us to compute the long chain of the computational graph first (highlighted in yellow) – getting all ourgradients just like we computed activations in forward pass. We could cache these gradients and reuse them, following the same efficient pattern we'd already mastered.We create a loop where we:Fetch a bridge node () from our unified bufferFetch the corresponding matrix, also from unified bufferStream these through our systolic array to compute the weight gradientsAnd here's where something really magical happens: we can stream these weight gradients directly into a gradient descent module while we're still computing them! This module takes the current weights stored in memory and updates them using the gradients.The gradient descent update rule:where  is the learning rate and represents any parameter (weights or biases)Computing weight gradients for our XOR network:Bias gradients (sum over samples):Applying gradient descent with learning rate:No waiting around — everything flows like water through our pipeline.You might be wondering: "We've used our matrix multiplication identities for the long chain and weight gradients — how do we calculate bias gradients?" Well, we've actually already done most of the work! Since we're processing batches of data, we can simply sum (the technical term is "reduce") thegradients across the batch dimension. The beauty is that we can do this reduction right when we're computing the long chain — no extra work required!With all these new changes and control flags, our instruction is significantly longer — 94 bits in fact! But we can confirm that every single one of these bits is needed and we ensured that we couldn't make the instruction set any smaller without compromising the speed and efficiency of the TPU.By continuing this same process iteratively – forward pass, backward pass, weight updates – we can train our network until it performs exactly how we want. The same systolic array that powered our inference now powers our training, with just a few additional modules to handle the gradient computations.What started as a simple idea about matrix multiplication has grown into a complete training system.

We started with Jupyter Notebooks, where each cell could be callable by MCP—so agents could turn them into tools for themselves. It worked well enough that the system became self-improving, churning out content, and acting like a co-pilot that helped you build new agents.But when we stepped back, what we had was these endless walls of text. And even though it worked, honestly, it was just boring. We were also convinced that it would be swallowed up by the next model’s capabilities. We wanted to build something else—something that made AI less of a black box and more engaging. Why type into a chat box all day if you could look your agents in the face, see their confusion, and watch when and how they interact?Both of us grew up on simulation games—RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Age of Empires, SimCity—so we started experimenting with running LLM agents inside a 3D world. At first it was pure curiosity, but right away, watching agents interact in real time was much more interesting than anything we’d done before.The very first version was small: a single Unity room, an MCP server, and a chat box. Even getting two agents to take turns took weeks. Every run surfaced quirks—agents refusing to talk at all, or only “speaking” by dancing or pulling facial expressions to show emotion. That unpredictability kept us building.Now it’s a desktop app (Tauri + Unity via WebGL) where humans and agents share 3D tile-based rooms. Agents receive structured observations every tick and can take actions that change the world. You can edit the rules between runs—prompts, decision logic, even how they see chat history—without rebuilding.On the technical side, we built a Unity bridge with MCP and multi-provider routing via LiteLLM, with local model support via Mistral.rs coming next. All system prompts are editable, so you can directly experiment with coordination strategies—tuning how “chatty” agents are versus how much they move or manipulate the environment.We then added a tilemap editor so you can design custom rooms, set tile-based events with conditions and actions, and turn them into puzzles or hazards. There’s community sharing built in, so you can post rooms you make.Watching agents collude or negotiate through falling tiles, teleports, landmines, fire, “win” and “lose” tiles, and tool calls for things like lethal fires or disco floors is a much more fun way to spend our days.Under the hood, Unity’s ECS drives a whole state machine and event system. And because humans and AI share the same space in real time, every negotiation, success, or failure also becomes useful multi-agent, multimodal data for post-training or world models.Our early users are already using it for prompt-injection testing, social engineering scenarios, cooperative games, and model comparisons.
The bigger vision is to build an open-ended, AI-native sim-game where you can build and interact with anything or anyone. You can design puzzles, levels, and environments, have agents compete or collaborate, set up games, or even replay your favorite TV shows.The fun part is that no two interactions are ever the same. Everything is emergent, not hard-coded, so the same level played six times will play out differently each time.The plan is to keep expanding—bigger rooms, more in-world tools for agents, and then multiplayer hosting. It’s live now, no waitlist. Free to play. You can bring your own API keys, or start with $10 in credits and run agents right away: www.TheInterface.com.We’d love feedback on scenarios worth testing and what to build next. Tell us the weird stuff you’d throw at this—we’ll be in the comments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#GarrickOhlsson: How #Chopin changed the piano forever 🎹💥</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8iaHzry12_M</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8iaHzry12_M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:33:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chopin Competition jury member Garrick Ohlsson breaks down the first of 16 ways that Chopin revolutionized modern piano playing.

Braden here, creator of Whispering, an open-source speech-to-text app.I really like dictation. For years, I relied on transcription tools that were  good, but they were all closed-source. Even a lot of them that claimed to be “local” or “on-device” were still black boxes that left me wondering where my audio really went.So I built Whispering. It’s open-source, local-first, and most importantly, transparent with your data.   Your data is stored locally on your device, and your audio goes directly from your machine to a local provider (Whisper C++, Speaches, etc.) or your chosen cloud provider (Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.). For me, the features were good enough that I left my paid tools behind (I used Superwhisper and Wispr Flow before).Productivity apps should be open-source and transparent with your data, but they also need to match the UX of paid, closed-software alternatives. I hope Whispering is near that point. I use it for several hours a day, from coding to thinking out loud while carrying pizza boxes back from the office.There are plenty of transcription apps out there, but I hope Whispering adds some extra competition from the OSS ecosystem (one of my other OSS favorites is Handy https://github.com/cjpais/Handy). Whispering has a few tricks up its sleeve, like a voice-activated mode for hands-free operation (no button holding), and customizable AI transformations with any prompt/model.I’m basically obsessed with local-first open-source software. I think there should be an open-source, local-first version of every app, and I would like them all to work together. The idea of Epicenter is to store your data in a folder of plaintext and SQLite, and build a suite of interoperable, local-first tools on top of this shared memory. Everything is totally transparent, so you can trust it.Whispering is the first app in this effort. It’s not there yet regarding memory, but it’s getting there. I’ll probably write more about the bigger picture soon, but mainly I just want to make software and let it speak for itself (no pun intended in this case!), so this is my Show HN for now.I just finished college and was about to move back with my parents and work on this instead of getting a job…and then I somehow got into YC. So my current plan is to cover my living expenses and use the YC funding to support maintainers, our dependencies, and people working on their own open-source local-first projects. More on that soon.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Career Growth Requires Singular Focus</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/dont-be-overemployed</link><author>Rahul Pandey</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTEwNDExMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjIxNDM1NH0.KU_HC9RlAuzaq6NFugnkIjhO6mrvJzTfytOINkYN-Lg/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:41:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Overemployment is simply a bad idea]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anna&apos;s Archive: An Update from the Team</title><link>https://annas-archive.org/blog/an-update-from-the-team.html</link><author>jerheinze</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:31:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

  We are still alive and kicking. In recent weeks we’ve seen increased attacks on our mission. We are taking steps to harden our infrastructure and operational security. The work of securing humanity’s legacy is worth fighting for.Since we started in 2022, we have liberated tens of millions of books, scientific articles, magazines, newspapers, and more. These are now forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts, and other catastrophes, thanks to everyone who helps with torrenting.Anna’s Archive itself has organized some of the largest scrapes: we acquired tens of millions of files from IA Controlled Digital Lending, HathiTrust, DuXiu, and many more.We have also scraped and published the largest book metadata collections in history: WorldCat, Google Books, and others. With this we’ll be able to identify which books are still missing from our collections, and prioritize saving the rarest ones.Much thanks to all of our volunteers for making these projects happen.We’ve forged some incredible partnerships. We’ve partnered with two LibGen forks, STC/Nexus, Z-Library. We’ve secured tens of millions additional files through these partnerships. And they are helping the mission by mirroring our files.Unfortunately we have seen the disappearance of one of the LibGen forks. We don’t have further information about what happened there, but are saddened by this development.There is a new entrant: WeLib. They appear to have mirrored most of our collection, and use a fork of our codebase. We have copied some of their user interface improvements, and are grateful for that push. Sadly, we are not seeing them share any new collections, nor share their codebase improvements. Since they haven’t shown commitment to contributing back to the ecosystem, we advise extreme caution. We recommend not using them.In the meantime, we have some exciting projects in the works. We have hundreds of terabytes in new collections sitting on our servers, waiting to be processed. If you’re at all interested in helping out, feel free to check out our Volunteering and Donate pages. We run all of this on a minimal budget, so any help is greatly appreciated.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Crocs Is Crushing It in China.

They’re called the “New Right,” and they share a basic hostility to American liberal democracy, a real desire to fundamentally overhaul it, and real influence in the White House. But why do they think that? How much influence do they really have? And what would a response to their rising prominence look like?

Today’s guest is Laura Field, a political theorist who’s spent a lot of time in the conservative intellectual world cataloging the wild world of far-right thinking for her book Furious Minds: The Making of the MAGA New Right.

She speaks with guest host Zack Beauchamp, author of Vox newsletter On The Right, about why ordinary Americans should really, definitely, and absolutely care what a handful of thinkers are putting out on obscure Substacks and YouTube channels.

  on time, even if my talk time was cut at the last moment (perhaps due to the
  prior speaker running over). The key to my ability to do this was to use
  Expansion Joints - parts of the talk that I'd
  pre-planned so I could cover them quickly or slowly depending on how much time
  I had.The way I'd do this would be to plan for some topics to be optional. The
  talk would work if I skipped over them, but I could also witter on about them
  for five (or ten) minutes. Ideally, each of these topics would get one slide,
  usually with a bunch of key phrases on it - the headings of what I'd talk
  about should I be talking about it. When I got to the slide, I'd look at how
  time was going with the talk. If (as was usually the case) I was running short
  of time, I could cover the slide in about thirty seconds, saying something
  like: “in doing this, there's a bunch of things you need to consider, but they
  are out of scope for today's talk”.If, however, I did have time, I could then spend some time talking about
  them. The slide would be simple, and not provide much of a Visual Channel, but that wasn't so important, after all this material
  was optional in the first place.The single flex-slide was my favorite Expansion Joint, as it was easy to
  use. Sometimes however my optional topic required a proper visual channel,
  necessitating dedicated slides. My solution here was good control over
  slide handling. Presentation tools include the ability to skip over slides
  while I'm talking, and I made sure I practiced how to use them so I could skip
  a bunch of slides without the audience knowing. It's crucial here that it's
  invisible to the audience, I find it looks sloppy if anyone says “in the
  interests of time I'll skip over these slides”. To do this, however, I do need
  access to my laptop while presenting, venues that only provide a clicker while
  loading the slides on some other machine lack that control. That started to
  happen in my last couple of years, much to my annoyance.When creating talks, I was always worried that I would run out of things to
  say, even though experience told me I reliably crammed more stuff in than I
  could possibly cover. Expansion Joints helped with this, I could aggressively
  trim the core talk to less than I needed, and rely on the Expansion Joints to
  fill the gap. In practice I usually didn't need the Expansion Joints anyway, but
  their presence helped my confidence.Using Expansion Joints was particularly important for me as I never
  rehearsed my talks. I was always someone whose ability to present was driven by
  adrenaline. Talking to a rubber duck just didn't work, the duck was clearly
  every bit as bored as I was. Consequently the first time I gave a talk, I was
  hazy as to how long it would take. Yet with Expansion Joints in place, I was
  able to finish a talk right on time.Expansion Joints enabled me to give the same talk
  to different time slots. Sometimes I'd have thirty minutes, sometimes
  forty-five. With Expansion Joints, I didn't need to change my slides,
  particularly handy if a time cut (or more rarely a time increase) appeared at the
  last moment. (Although in my later years, I handled this by doing a Suite Of Talks.)Talks that encourage audience interaction need these because we can never
  predict how much time the interaction will use up. Sometimes we get a steady
  stream of questions, other times (particularly in Scandinavia, or
  upper-Midwest America) a lack of questions had me blasting through the agenda.
  Any such talk needed a double-dose of this temporal ballast.Expansion Joints are at their most useful in later parts of the talk, as

The long straight boulevards, the fountains, the galleries and museums- even the bread that comes with European cuisine were brought in by Napoleon. He wanted to make it a city that reflected his imperial ambition. But this city shaped him too - Paris is where he went through his most formative experiences as a young man, where he first tasted power, seduction and revolution.Dan joins historian and expert guide Stephanie Paul in Paris to explore the story of Napoleon's early life here, how the city shaped him and how he created the Paris we recognise today.This episode is part of our 'Dan Snow's Guide to Europe' Series.Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore. The production manager was Beth Donaldson.Join Dan and the team for a special LIVE recording of Dan Snow's History Hit on Friday, 12th September 2025! To celebrate 10 years of the podcast, Dan is putting on a special show of signature storytelling, never-before-heard anecdotes from his often stranger-than-fiction career, as well as answering the burning questions you've always wanted to ask!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside The Lost Treasure Tombs Of Ancient Maya</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs2ZDSozQ4w</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Gs2ZDSozQ4w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 21:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hidden by dense undergrowth, the true size of ancient Mayan cities has been poorly understood up until now.

They are lost worlds floating in the dark, and there are likely tens of billions in the Milky Way galaxy alone. Today, we will journey through the galaxy in search of these lost worlds in the darkness of interstellar space, and sometimes even, intergalactic space.

What made them different and why did they become extinct? How close or hostile were they to modern man?

Modern methods are drawing an increasingly accurate picture of our closest relative. The result sounds like true crime story from the Stone Age: it's about sex, weapons and cannibalism. And the question of how much Neanderthal still remains in each and every one of us.

With breathtaking footage, the film provides insights into a sport that has its origins in Polynesian culture. It was filmed on the coasts of Tahiti, Hawaii and California.

Surfing is a sport that’s far more than just a game: It’s also the expression of a culture.

In this case, it is the culture of a people who live with and on the water - the Polynesians. The art of riding the waves is their ancient heritage. Surfing was on the verge of extinction almost a century ago - a thorn in the side of Christian missionaries.

It owes its resurrection to a handful of young runaways, businessmen and rebellious young men and women from all over the world. Their stories are told here. Surfing grew in popularity around the world, and eventually became a competitive sport, earning a place in the Olympics.

What is intelligence? What is… complexity? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly learn how complexity science, chaos theory, and emergence could be the key to understanding our place in the universe with David Krakauer, president of the Santa Fe Institute and professor in complex systems. 

If chemistry is universal, could music be? We dive into what makes something “universal,” why Mars is inhabited by robots, and how cities, economies, and societies exhibit emergent behaviors. We explore the roots of complexity science, from steam engines to organisms, and how early thinkers laid the groundwork for studying order in chaos. 

What does it mean to call something “emergent”? We break down the definition of emergence, chaos theory, and its relationship to math, physics, biology, economics, and psychology. We discuss humans as individual particles and when the unpredictable becomes predictable. How do we get order out of disorder? We break down how intelligence isn’t just about answers, it’s about understanding. We examine AI, fake knowledge vs. real problem-solving, and whether life itself is a computational process.

Can consciousness be measured? Are we intelligent, or just clever tools using even cleverer tools? We break down how problem-solving matter transcends what it’s made of. Where does creativity come from? Plus, if life is problem-solving matter, what is the problem it is trying to solve?

Normally, if we have a belief system, such as a particular religion, some kind of morality follows. Can the direction of causation go in reverse? If we commit to a particular morality, whether absolute or relative, are there implications for ultimate reality? Can morality say anything about the deep nature of the world?

"We thought Python couldn't grow any further, but AI code assistants let Python take yet another step forward."
 According to recent studies of Stanford University (Yegor Denisov-Blanch), AI code assistants such as Microsoft Copilot, Cursor or Google Gemini Code Assist are 20% more effective if used for popular programming languages. The reason for this is obvious: there is more code for these languages available to train the underlying models. This trend is visible in the TIOBE index as well, where we see a consolidation of languages at the top. Why would you start to learn a new obscure language for which no AI assistance is available? This is the modern way of saying that you don't want to learn a new language that is hardly documented and/or has too few libraries that can help you.
 
TIOBE's "Programming Community Index" attempts to calculate the popularity of languages using the number of skilled engineers, courses, and third-party vendors. It nows gives Python a 26.14% rating, which TechRepublic notes "is well ahead of the next two programming languages on this month's leaderboard: C++ is at 9.18% and C is 9.03%." But the first top six languages haven't changed since last year...


PythonC++C JavaC#JavaScript
Since August of 2024 SQL has dropped from its #7 rank down to #12 (meaning Visual Basic and Go each rise up one rank from their position a year ago, into the #7 and #8 positions). 
In the last year Perl has risen from the #25 position to #9, beating out Delphi/Oracle Pascal at #10, and Fortran at #11 (last year's #10). TIOBE CEO Jansen "told TechRepublic in an email that many people were asking why Perl was becoming more popular, but he didn't have a definitive answer. He said he double-checked the underlying data and found the increase to be accurate, though the reason for the shift remains unclear."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why This Giant Snake Is So Destructive</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seVy6d9lQ0k</link><author>Real Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/seVy6d9lQ0k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 14:07:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC176GAQozKKjhz62H8u9vQQ">Real Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To get 20% off an annual premium subscription to Brilliant, go to https://brilliant.org/realscience/

On January 16, 1991, the Gulf War began when an international coalition of 39 nations responded decisively to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. In the opening hours, coalition aircraft struck Iraq’s air defense systems and command networks, crippling its ability to respond.

At the time, the Iraqi Air Force was the sixth largest in the world. But within days, it was overwhelmed. Many Iraqi jets were lost in the early hours of combat, and hundreds more were destroyed on the ground. Facing near-total air superiority by the coalition, Saddam Hussein ordered a mass evacuation of Iraqi aircraft to neighboring Iran, hoping to preserve them for the future.

To block escape routes, the U.S. Air Force deployed F-15 Eagles on patrol along the Iranian border, trapping Saddam's Air Force inside the country. In response, Iraq launched an ambitious counter-operation: “Operation Samurra”. The plan set the stage for a rare head-to-head clash between two Cold War icons—the MiG-25 Foxbat and the F-15 Eagle.

The F-15 Eagle, built by the United States, was a cutting-edge fighter designed with state-of-the-art  avionics, radar systems, and precision weapons. It represented the peak of Western air superiority doctrine. The MiG-25 Foxbat on the other hand was an interceptor built by the Soviet Union. By the 1990s, it was hopelessly outdated but still incredibly fast and dangerous in the right hands. Where the Eagle was refined and sophisticated, the Foxbat was an instrument of brute force.

What followed was one of the most surprising aerial encounters of the Gulf War, with an outcome few could have expected.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Machine Learning Contest Aims to Improve Speech BCIs</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/speech-bci-machine-learning-competition</link><author>Elissa Welle</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQ2MTU4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDY5NTkyNn0.9SfY72kb3swNmP4CCUGef5WZl0-Mg2baBNTuhBBEL8g/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Researchers hope public brain data will spur innovation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Good system design</title><link>https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-system-design/</link><author>dondraper36</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 07:38:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I see a lot of bad system design advice. One classic is the LinkedIn-optimized “bet you never heard of ” style of post, presumably aimed at people who are new to the industry. Another is the Twitter-optimized “you’re a terrible engineer if you ever store booleans in a database” clever trick. Even good system design advice can be kind of bad. I love Designing Data-Intensive Applications, but I don’t think it’s particularly useful for most system design problems engineers will run into.What is system design? In my view, if software design is how you assemble lines of code, system design is how you assemble . The primitives of software design are variables, functions, classes, and so on. The primitives of system design are app servers, databases, caches, queues, event buses, proxies, and so on. This post is my attempt to write down, in broad strokes, everything I know about good system design. A lot of the concrete judgment calls do come down to experience, which I can’t convey in this post. But I’m trying to write down what I can.What does good system design look like? I’ve written before that it looks underwhelming. In practice, it looks like nothing going wrong for a long time. You can tell that you’re in the presence of good design if you have thoughts like “huh, this ended up being easier than I expected”, or “I never have to think about this part of the system, it’s fine”. Paradoxically, good design is self-effacing: bad design is often more impressive than good. I’m always suspicious of impressive-looking systems. If a system has distributed-consensus mechanisms, many different forms of event-driven communication, CQRS, and other clever tricks, I wonder if there’s some fundamental bad decision that’s being compensated for (or if the system is just straightforwardly over-designed).I’m often alone on this. Engineers look at complex systems with many interesting parts and think “wow, a lot of system design is happening here!” In fact, a complex system usually reflects an absence of good design. I say “usually” because sometimes you do need complex systems. I’ve worked on many systems that earned their complexity. However, a complex system that works always evolves from a simple system that works. Beginning from scratch with a complex system is a really bad idea.The hard part about software design is state. If you’re storing any kind of information for any amount of time, you have a lot of tricky decisions to make about how you save, store and serve it. If you’re not storing information, your app is “stateless”. As a non-trivial example, GitHub has an internal API that takes a PDF file and returns a HTML rendering of it. That’s a real stateless service. Anything that writes to a database is stateful.You should try and minimize the amount of stateful components in any system. (In a sense this is trivially true, because you should try to minimize the amount of  components in a system, but stateful components are particularly dangerous.) The reason you should do this is that stateful components can get into a bad state. Our stateless PDF-rendering service will safely run forever, as long as you’re doing broadly sensible things: e.g. running it in a restartable container so that if anything goes wrong it can be automatically killed and restored to working order. A stateful service can’t be automatically repaired like this. If your database gets a bad entry in it (for instance, an entry with a format that triggers a crash in your application), you have to manually go in and fix it up. If your database runs out of room, you have to figure out some way to prune unneeded data or expand it.What this means in practice is having one service that knows about the state - i.e. it talks to a database - and other services that do stateless things. Avoid having five different services all write to the same table. Instead, have four of them send API requests (or emit events) to the first service, and keep the writing logic in that one service. If you can, it’s worth doing this for the read logic as well, although I’m less absolutist about this. It’s  better for services to do a quick read of the  table than to make a 2x slower HTTP request to an internal sessions service.Since managing state is the most important part of system design, the most important component is usually where that state lives: the database. I’ve spent most of my time working with SQL databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL), so that’s what I’m going to talk about.If you need to store something in a database, the first thing to do is define a table with the schema you need. Schema design should be flexible, because once you have thousands or millions of records, it can be an enormous pain to change the schema. However, if you make it too flexible (e.g. by sticking everything in a “value” JSON column, or using “keys” and “values” tables to track arbitrary data) you load a ton of complexity into the application code (and likely buy some very awkward performance constraints). Drawing the line here is a judgment call and depends on specifics, but in general I aim to have my tables be human-readable: you should be able to go through the database schema and get a rough idea of what the application is storing and why.If you expect your table to ever be more than a few rows, you should put indexes on it. Try to make your indexes match the most common queries you’re sending (e.g. if you query by  and , create an index with those two fields). Indexes work like nested dictionaries, so make sure to put the highest-cardinality fields first (otherwise each index lookup will have to scan all users of  to find the one with the right ). Don’t index on every single thing you can think of, since each index adds write overhead.Accessing the database is often the bottleneck in high-traffic applications. This is true even when the compute side of things is relatively inefficient (e.g. Ruby on Rails running on a preforking server like Unicorn). That’s because complex applications need to make a  of database calls - hundreds and hundreds for every single request, often sequentially (because you don’t know if you need to check whether a user is part of an organization until after you’ve confirmed they’re not abusive, and so on). How can you avoid getting bottlenecked?When querying the database, . It’s almost always more efficient to get the database to do the work than to do it yourself. For instance, if you need data from multiple tables,  them instead of making separate queries and stitching them together in-memory. Particularly if you’re using an ORM, beware accidentally making queries in an inner loop. That’s an easy way to turn a select id, name from table to a  and a hundred select name from table where id = ?.Every so often you do want to break queries apart. It doesn’t happen often, but I’ve run into queries that were ugly enough that it was easier on the database to split them up than to try to run them as a single query. I’m sure it’s always possible to construct indexes and hints such that the database can do it better, but the occasional tactical query-split is a tool worth having in your toolbox.Send as many read queries as you can to database replicas. A typical database setup will have one write node and a bunch of read-replicas. The more you can avoid reading from the write node, the better - that write node is already busy enough doing all the writes. The exception is when you really, really can’t tolerate any replication lag (since read-replicas are always running at least a handful of ms behind the write node). But in most cases replication lag can be worked around with simple tricks: for instance, when you update a record but need to use it right after, you can fill in the updated details in-memory instead of immediately re-reading after a write.Beware spikes of queries (particularly write queries, and  transactions). Once a database gets overloaded, it gets slow, which makes it more overloaded. Transactions and writes are good at overloading databases, because they require a lot of database work for each query. If you’re designing a service that might generate massive query spikes (e.g. some kind of bulk-import API), consider throttling your queries.Slow operations, fast operationsA service has to do some things fast. If a user is interacting with something (say, an API or a web page), they should see a response within a few hundred ms. But a service has to do other things that are slow. Some operations just take a long time (converting a very large PDF to HTML, for instance). The general pattern for this is splitting out the minimum amount of work needed to do something useful for the user and doing the rest of the work in the background. In the PDF-to-HTML example, you might render the first page to HTML immediately and queue up the rest in a background job.What’s a background job? It’s worth answering this in detail, because “background jobs” are a core system design primitive. Every tech company will have some kind of system for running background jobs. There will be two main components: a collection of queues, e.g. in Redis, and a job runner service that will pick up items from the queues and execute them. You enqueue a background job by putting an item like  on the queue. It’s also possible to schedule background jobs to run at a set time (which is useful for periodic cleanups or summary rollups). Background jobs should be your first choice for slow operations, because they’re typically such a well-trodden path.Sometimes you want to roll your own queue system. For instance, if you want to enqueue a job to run in a month, you probably shouldn’t put an item on the Redis queue. Redis persistence is typically not guaranteed over that period of time (and even if it is, you likely want to be able to query for those far-future enqueued jobs in a way that would be tricky with the Redis job queue). In this case, I typically create a database table for the pending operation with columns for each param plus a  column. I then use a daily job to check for these items with , and either delete them or mark them as complete once the job has finished.Sometimes an operation is slow because it needs to do an expensive (i.e. slow) task that’s the same between users. For instance, if you’re calculating how much to charge a user in a billing service, you might need to do an API call to look up the current prices. If you’re charging users per-use (like OpenAI does per-token), that could (a) be unacceptably slow and (b) cause a lot of traffic for whatever service is serving the prices. The classic solution here is : only looking up the prices every five minutes, and storing the value in the meantime. It’s easiest to cache in-memory, but using some fast external key-value store like Redis or Memcached is also popular (since it means you can share one cache across a bunch of app servers).The typical pattern is that junior engineers learn about caching and want to cache , while senior engineers want to cache as little as possible. Why is that? It comes down to the first point I made about the danger of statefulness. A cache is a source of state. It can get weird data in it, or get out-of-sync with the actual truth, or cause mysterious bugs by serving stale data, and so on. You should never cache something without first making a serious effort to speed it up. For instance, it’s silly to cache an expensive SQL query that isn’t covered by a database index. You should just add the database index!I use caching a lot. One useful caching trick to have in the toolbox is using a scheduled job and a document storage like S3 or Azure Blob Storage as a large-scale persistent cache. If you need to cache the result of a  expensive operation (say, a weekly usage report for a large customer), you might not be able to fit the result in Redis or Memcached. Instead, stick a timestamped blob of the results in your document storage and serve the file directly from there. Like the database-backed long-term queue I mentioned above, this is an example of using the caching  without using a specific cache technology.As well as some kind of caching infrastructure and background job system, tech companies will typically have an . The most common implementation of this is Kafka. An event hub is just a queue - like the one for background jobs - but instead of putting “run this job with these params” on the queue, you put “this thing happened” on the queue. One classic example is firing off a “new account created” event for each new account, and then having multiple services consume that event and take some action: a “send a welcome email” service, a “scan for abuse” service, a “set up per-account infrastructure” service, and so on.You shouldn’t overuse events. Much of the time it’s better to just have one service make an API request to another service: all the logs are in the same place, it’s easier to reason about, and you can immediately see what the other service responded with. Events are good for when the code sending the event doesn’t necessarily care what the consumers do with the event, or when the events are high-volume and not particularly time-sensitive (e.g. abuse scanning on each new Twitter post).When you need data to flow from one place to a lot of other places, there are two options. The simplest is to . This is how most websites work: you have a server that owns some data, and when a user wants it they make a request (via their browser) to the server to pull that data down to them. The problem here is that users might do a lot of pulling down the same data - e.g. refreshing their email inbox to see if they have any new emails, which will pull down and reload the entire web application instead of just the data about the emails.The alternative is to . Instead of allowing users to ask for the data, you allow them to register as clients, and then when the data changes, the server pushes the data down to each client. This is how GMail works: you don’t have to refresh the page to get new emails, because they’ll just appear when they arrive.If we’re talking about background services instead of users with web browsers, it’s easy to see why pushing can be a good idea. Even in a very large system, you might only have a hundred or so services that need the same data. For data that doesn’t change much, it’s much easier to make a hundred HTTP requests (or RPC, or whatever) whenever the data changes than to serve up the same data a thousand times a second.Suppose you did need to serve up-to-date data to a million clients (like GMail, does). Should those clients be pushing or pulling? It depends. Either way, you won’t be able to run it all from a single server, so you’ll need to farm it out to other components of the system. If you’re pushing, that will likely mean sticking each push on an event queue and having a horde of event processors each pulling from the queue and sending out your pushes. If you’re pulling, that will mean standing up a bunch (say, a hundred) of fast read-replica cache servers that will sit in front of your main application and handle all the read traffic.When you’re designing a system, there are lots of different ways users can interact with it or data can flow through it. It can get a bit overwhelming. The trick is to mainly focus on the “hot paths”: the part of the system that is most critically important, and the part of the system that is going to handle the most data. For instance, in a metered billing system, those pieces might be the part that decides whether or not a customer gets charged, and the part that needs to hook into all user actions on the platform to identify how much to charge.Hot paths are important because they have fewer possible solutions than other design areas. There are a thousand ways you can build a billing settings page and they’ll all mainly work. But there might be only a handful of ways that you can sensibly consume the firehose of user actions. Hot paths also go wrong more spectacularly. You have to really screw up a settings page to take down the entire product, but any code you write that’s triggered on all user actions can easily cause huge problems.How do you know if you’ve got problems? One thing I’ve learned from my most paranoid colleagues is to log aggressively during unhappy paths. If you’re writing a function that checks a bunch of conditions to see if a user-facing endpoint should respond 422, you should log out the condition that was hit. If you’re writing billing code, you should log every decision made (e.g. “we’re not billing for this event because of X”). Many engineers don’t do this because it adds a bunch of logging boilerplate and makes it hard to write beautifully elegant code, but you should do it anyway. You’ll be happy you did when an important customer is complaining that they’re getting a 422 - even if that customer did something wrong, you still need to figure out  for them.You should also have basic observability into the operational parts of the system. That means CPU/memory on the hosts or containers, queue sizes, average time per-request or per-job, and so on. For user-facing metrics like time per-request, you also need to watch the p95 and p99 (i.e. how slow your slowest requests are). Even one or two very slow requests are scary, because they’re disproportionately from your largest and most important users. If you’re just looking at averages, it’s easy to miss the fact that some users are finding your service unusable.Killswitches, retries, and failing gracefullyI wrote a whole post about killswitches that I won’t repeat here, but the gist is that you should think carefully about what happens when the system fails badly.Retries are not a magic bullet. You need to make sure you’re not putting extra load on other services by blindly retrying failed requests. If you can, put high-volume API calls inside a “circuit breaker”: if you get too many 5xx responses in a row, stop sending requests for a while to let the service recover. You also need to make sure you’re not retrying write events that may or may not have succeeded (for instance, if you send a “bill this user” request and get back a 5xx,  if the user has been billed or not). The classic solution to this is to use an “idempotency key”, which is a special UUID in the request that the other service uses to avoid re-running old requests: every time they do something, they save the idempotency key, and if they get another request with the same key, they silently ignore it. It’s also important to decide what happens when part of your system fails. For instance, say you have some rate limiting code that checks a Redis bucket to see if a user has made too many requests in the current window. What happens when that Redis bucket is unavailable? You have two options: fail  and let the request through, or fail  and block the request with a 429.Whether you should fail open or closed depends on the specific feature. In my view, a rate limiting system should almost always fail open. That means that a problem with the rate limiting code isn’t necessarily a big user-facing incident. However, auth should (obviously) always fail closed: it’s better to deny a user access to their own data than to give a user access to some other user’s data. There are a lot of cases where it’s not clear what the right behavior is. It’s often a difficult tradeoff.There are some topics I’m deliberately not covering here. For instance, whether or when to split your monolith out into different services, when to use containers or VMs, tracing, good API design. Partly this is because I don’t think it matters that much (in my experience, monoliths are fine), or because I think it’s too obvious to talk about (you should use tracing), or because I just don’t have the time (API design is complicated).The main point I’m trying to make is what I said at the start of this post: good system design is not about clever tricks, it’s about knowing how to use boring, well-tested components in the right place. I’m not a plumber, but I imagine good plumbing is similar: if you’re doing something too exciting, you’re probably going to end up with crap all over yourself.Especially at large tech companies, where these components already exist off the shelf (i.e. your company already has some kind of event bus, caching service, etc), good system design is going to look like nothing. There are very, very few areas where you want to do the kind of system design you could talk about at a conference. They do exist! I have seen hand-rolled data structures make features possible that wouldn’t have been possible otherwise. But I’ve only seen that happen once or twice in ten years. I see boring system design every single day.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Iqunix Magi65 keyboard!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qxaWj2Ab8</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/t3qxaWj2Ab8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 16 Aug 2025 05:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://iqunix.com/products/magi65

Rather than numerous day-one first-party releases that may risk overshadowing each other, the company has been releasing them one at a time, monthly. First we had Mario Kart World--alongside Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which  counts--followed by Donkey Kong Bananza, and now, Drag X Drive. The unconventional sports game is unique in the lineup for not centering around a known franchise. Instead its hook is an almost exclusively multiplayer focus and a novel control scheme based around the system's mouse functionality. But while it's a neat showpiece for how dual-mouse controls can create new game experiences, in practice it's mostly just physically uncomfortable to play and too bare-bones to hold your interest.Drag X Drive follows in the footsteps of games like Rocket League, mixing various influences to create something new. In this case, its closest analog is wheelchair basketball, a Paralympic sport that allows disabled athletes to play with some modifications. It adds a slight twist to that foundation, though, by taking place inside a skateboarding bowl, allowing players to build up speed and do trick shots to earn score bonuses. It's a neat concept, and one that could pay homage to the athleticism of the real thing while giving it a wild variation. The hub area even has the look and feel of a basketball skate park, with courts living alongside loads of ramps and stunt areas.The real hook is its control scheme. While other games have made light use of the Switch 2 mouse controls, Drag X Drive is centered completely around it. You detach both Joy-Con controllers and turn them on their side, and sliding them forward together approximates pushing the wheels of your wheelchair. Doing it in rhythm for a while gets you up to top speed, which is what enables your ability to vert off ramps and do tricks, or just rush into other players for a tackle to steal the ball. You lift a hand and flick your wrist to toss a ball into the basket, and tackling a player from the side or back staggers them for a moment and can throw off their attempted shot. Pressing the shoulder buttons acts as your brakes, and the HD Rumble feature lets you feel the tread of the tires as you roll. In theory, you can even pull off hairpin turns by braking with one wheel while pushing the other, or sliding them in opposite directions.You can pull off more complex tricks like a bunny hop or a backflip off a halfpipe for additional style points. And since the controllers map onto your hands, in the lobby you have free control to do things like wave or high-five.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hunter Biden isn’t afraid of Trump Lawsuit</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Gc969dM__Os</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Gc969dM__Os?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:59:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2366 - Sam Tripoli</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx8BcDThVeQ</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rx8BcDThVeQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sam Tripoli is comic, writer, host of the "Tin Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli"  podcast, and co-host of several others, including "Cash Daddies," "Conspiracy Social Club," "Punch Drunk Sports," "Union of the Unwanted" and "Broken Simulation."

Physicists have a major problem: the universe's first black holes grew too massive, too quickly. But a newly discovered black hole might hold the key. LID-568 has been spotted breaking the Eddington Limit, consuming matter faster than physics should allow. Could this discovery rewrite the story of our early universe?

Correction: 
12:08 We're sorry, the black hole has swallowed one of our media files!

Fran Wescott (Durham, North Carolina), a strategic content consultant, is a wife and mother of two young adults. Her earliest culinary memories are around meals at the dinner table at her childhood home in Durham, her grandparents’ home in Moore County, NC, and in far-flung places where she and her family traveled.

Researchers around the world are focusing on bacteriophages. These "good" viruses infect specific bacteria and destroy them. Do they offer a way out of the antibiotics crisis?

Every year, around 1.3 million people die because of antibiotic resistance. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this is one of the biggest threats to global health.

There are various reasons for the growing number of antibiotic resistances: Unspecific or incorrect use of antibiotics causes bacteria to mutate into multi-resistant germs. In addition, the excessive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry has alarming consequences for humans: Antibiotics, which were considered one of medicine's greatest achievements against infections, are increasingly losing their effectiveness. Increasingly, science is relying on the potential of bacteria-eating viruses, or bacteriophages, to combat bacteria.

Researchers from the US, Georgia, Kenya and Uganda are developing suitable phage therapies and establishing international collaborations. And they’re finding what they’re looking for in bacteria-contaminated wastewater. Phage samples from the US and African countries will help to build up a biobank and produce specific phage cocktails. Phage therapy has not yet been approved in Germany due to a lack of clinical studies. However, in some countries, such as Georgia and Slovakia, bacteriophages are being used successfully to treat patients with antibiotic resistances.

Goodwins calls this approach dangerous, noting that "succession is always a time of uncertainty for those who like the way things are, and opportunity for those who do not."

Dualism is the theory that ultimate reality is composed of two radically different kinds of things, physical things and non-physical things, and that these same two kinds of things, expressed as body/brain and spirit/soul, account for consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Dualism (like the ‘interaction problem’)?

All the continents could fit into it and still be surrounded by water. But it’s not just a natural wonder. It’s now a global stage for military drills, climate research, and urgent conservation. 

As powers like Germany ramp up their Pacific presence, researchers like Nan Hauser are fighting a different kind of battle, to protect whales whose ancient migration routes are being reshaped by rising seas and warming waters.

DESCRIPTION
Sheen Brisals sits down with software engineer and author Vlad Khononov to explore his latest book, "Balancing Coupling in Software Design". Vlad shares his journey from a failed microservices project to his deep dive into the principles of coupling, drawing insights from a 1970s structured design book.

The duo discusses the timeless nature of coupling in software, how modern systems like microservices and cloud architectures still rely on age-old design principles, and the importance of understanding complexity for better problem decomposition and estimation. Vlad also reveals his unique approach to the book—integrating AI-generated poetry into each chapter to help readers grasp complex concepts. With a focus on modularity as the antidote to complexity, Vlad emphasizes that by managing coupling, engineers can create more maintainable, scalable systems.

But right now the company is under pressure, hit by a spending slowdown in China. US President Donald Trump’s trade war has only piled on to its problems. 

In August, Trump imposed a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland, steeper than the 31% he had previously threatened. The surcharge, though like most others by Trump subject to ongoing litigation, is the biggest among developed countries and compares with just 15% in the neighboring European Union. 

With falling sales, Swatch’s leadership has been criticized by some shareholders. Steven Wood, an activist investor, even attempted to win a seat on the company’s board. His intervention, rare in the luxury and watch sectors, may underline the frustration exhibited by other shareholders. So can Swatch turn its fortunes around?

The Register reports: Following the industry rattling launch of DeepSeek R1 earlier this year, the Chinese AI darling faced pressure from government authorities to train the model's successor on Huawei's homegrown silicon, three unnamed sources have told the Financial Times. But after months of work and the help of an entire team of Huawei engineers, unstable chips, glacial interconnects, and immature software proved insurmountable for DeepSeek, which was apparently unable to complete a single successful training run. The failure, along with challenges with data labeling, ultimately delayed the release of DeepSeek R2 as the company started anew, using Nvidia's H20 GPUs instead.

Michelangelo took on one of the most ambitious artistic feats in history when painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. With little help and immense pressure, was driven by deep faith and a desire to glorify God. He transformed biblical stories into a masterpiece of staggering scale and beauty that still lives on today. But the triumph came at a cost that left him physically broken and spiritually drained. Renaissance: The Blood and the Beauty reveals the tortured secrets behind the making of the Sistine Chapel.

In 1987, Steven Weinberg wrote a cute little paper entitled “Anthropic Bound on the Cosmological Constant”. I say cute little paper because it feels minor in comparison to, say, electroweak unification theory that won him the Nobel Prize. Weinberg was foundational in establishing the standard model of particle physics, and represented an enormous leap in understanding how this universe works. But his little 1987 paper, though more obscure, may tell us something about how the multiverse works, and can even be thought of as evidence for the existence of an enormous number of other universes.

Dr. Paul examines famous portrayals from shows like 'The Spanish Princess', 'The Other Boleyn Girl', 'Wolf Hall', and 'The Tudors', as well as the recent film 'Firebrand'. She analyses the historical accuracy of key scenes, from Henry's first meeting with Catherine of Aragon to the downfall of Anne Boleyn and the controversial marriage to Katherine Howard.

Throughout the video, Dr. Paul critiques the casting choices of actors like Damian Lewis, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman, discussing how they capture the complex and often terrifying personality of the Tudor king. She delves into the realities behind the dramatic events, including the annulment from Catherine of Aragon, the secret marriage to Anne Boleyn, the birth of his long-awaited son with Jane Seymour, the disastrous union with Anne of Cleves, and the tragic fate of Katherine Howard, culminating in a look at his final years with Katherine Parr.

The 2016 historical drama series tells of the rise of the powerful Florentine banking dynasty, and with it, the story of the Renaissance. Until recently, I could simply have gone to Netflix and found it there, alongside a wide array of award-winning and obscure titles. But when I Google the show in 2025, the Netflix link only takes me to a blank page. I don’t see it on HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, or any of the smaller streaming platforms. On Amazon Prime I am required to buy each of the three seasons or 24 episodes separately, whereupon they would be stored in a library subject to overnight deletion. Raised in the land of The Pirate Bay, the Swedish torrent index, I feel, for the first time in a decade, a nostalgia for the high seas of digital piracy. And I am not alone.For my teenage self in the 00s, torrenting was the norm. Need the new Coldplay album on your iPod? The Pirate Bay. The 1968 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet? The Pirate Bay. Whatever you needed was accessible with just a couple of clicks. But as smartphones proliferated, so did Spotify, the music streaming platform that is also headquartered in Sweden. The same Scandinavian country had become a hub of illegal torrenting and simultaneously conjured forth its solution.“Spotify would never have seen the light of day without The Pirate Bay,” Per Sundin, the then managing director of Universal Music Sweden, reflected in 2011. But music torrenting died out as we all either listened with ads or paid for the subscription. And when Netflix launched in Sweden in late 2012, open talk of torrenting moving images also stopped. Most of the big shows and a great collection of award-winning films could all be found for just 79 SEK (£6) a month. Meanwhile, the three founders of The Pirate Bay were arrested and eventually jailed. Pirating faded into the history books as far as I was concerned.A decade and a half on from the Pirate Bay trial, the winds have begun to shift. On an unusually warm summer’s day, I sit with fellow film critics by the old city harbour, once a haven for merchants and, rumour has it, smugglers. Cold  in hand (that’s what they call pints up here), they start venting about the “enshittification” of streaming – enshittification being the process by which platforms degrade their services and ultimately die in the pursuit of profit. Netflix now costs upwards of 199 SEK (£15), and you need more and more subscriptions to watch the same shows you used to find in one place. Most platforms now offer plans that, despite the fee, force advertisements on subscribers. Regional restrictions often compel users to use VPNs to access the full selection of available content. The average European household now spends close to €700 (£600) a year on three or more VOD subscriptions. People pay more and get less.A fellow film critic confides anonymously: “I never stopped pirating, and my partner also does it if he doesn’t find the precise edition he is looking for on DVD.” While some people never abandoned piracy, others admit they have recently returned – this time turning to unofficial streaming platforms. One commonly used app is legal but can, through community add-ons, channel illicit streams. “Downloading is too difficult. I don’t know where to start,” says one film viewer. “The shady streams might bombard me with ads, but at least I don’t have to worry about getting hacked or caught.”“Piracy is not a pricing issue,” Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve, the company behind the world’s largest PC gaming platform, Steam, observed in 2011. “It’s a service issue.” Today, the crisis in streaming makes this clearer than ever. With titles scattered, prices on the rise, and bitrates throttled depending on your browser, it is little wonder some viewers are raising the jolly roger again. Studios carve out fiefdoms, build walls and levy tolls for those who wish to visit. The result is artificial scarcity in a digital world that promised abundance.Whether piracy today is rebellion or resignation is almost irrelevant; the sails are hoisted either way. As the streaming landscape fractures into feudal territories, more viewers are turning to the high seas. The Medici understood the value linked to access. A client could travel from Rome to London and still draw on their credit, thanks to a network built on trust and interoperability. If today’s studios want to survive the storm, they may need to rediscover that truth.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gemma 3 270M: Compact model for hyper-efficient AI</title><link>https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3-270m/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:08:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The last few months have been an exciting time for the Gemma family of open models. We introduced Gemma 3 and Gemma 3 QAT, delivering state-of-the-art performance for single cloud and desktop accelerators. Then, we announced the full release of Gemma 3n, a mobile-first architecture bringing powerful, real-time multimodal AI directly to edge devices. Our goal has been to provide useful tools for developers to build with AI, and we continue to be amazed by the vibrant Gemmaverse you are helping create, celebrating together as downloads surpassed 200 million last week.Today, we're adding a new, highly specialized tool to the Gemma 3 toolkit: Gemma 3 270M, a compact, 270-million parameter model designed from the ground up for task-specific fine-tuning with strong instruction-following and text structuring capabilities already trained in.Core capabilities of Gemma 3 270MCompact and capable architecture: Our new model has a total of 270 million parameters: 170 million embedding parameters due to a large vocabulary size and 100 million for our transformer blocks. Thanks to the large vocabulary of 256k tokens, the model can handle specific and rare tokens, making it a strong base model to be further fine-tuned in specific domains and languages.Extreme energy efficiency: A key advantage of Gemma 3 270M is its low power consumption. Internal tests on a Pixel 9 Pro SoC show the INT4-quantized model used just 0.75% of the battery for 25 conversations, making it our most power-efficient Gemma model. An instruction-tuned model is released alongside a pre-trained checkpoint. While this model is not designed for complex conversational use cases, it’s a strong model that follows general instructions right out of the box.In engineering, success is defined by efficiency, not just raw power. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to hang a picture frame. The same principle applies to building with AI.Gemma 3 270M embodies this "right tool for the job" philosophy. It's a high-quality foundation model that follows instructions well out of the box, and its true power is unlocked through fine-tuning. Once specialized, it can execute tasks like text classification and data extraction with remarkable accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness. By starting with a compact, capable model, you can build production systems that are lean, fast, and dramatically cheaper to operate.A real-world blueprint for successThe power of this approach has already delivered incredible results in the real world. A perfect example is the work done by Adaptive ML with SK Telecom. Facing the challenge of nuanced, multilingual content moderation, they chose to specialize. Instead of using a massive, general-purpose model, Adaptive ML fine-tuned a Gemma 3 4B model. The results were stunning: the specialized Gemma model not only met but exceeded the performance of much larger proprietary models on its specific task.Gemma 3 270M is designed to let developers take this approach even further, unlocking even greater efficiency for well-defined tasks. It's the perfect starting point for creating a fleet of small, specialized models, each an expert at its own task.Gemma 3 270M used to power a Bedtime Story Generator web app using Transformers.js. The model’s size and performance make it suitable for offline, web-based, creative tasks. (Credit: Joshua (@xenovacom on X) from the Hugging Face team)When to choose Gemma 3 270MGemma 3 270M inherits the advanced architecture and robust pre-training of the Gemma 3 collection, providing a solid foundation for your custom applications.Here’s when it’s the perfect choice:You have a high-volume, well-defined task. Ideal for functions like sentiment analysis, entity extraction, query routing, unstructured to structured text processing, creative writing, and compliance checks.You need to make every millisecond and micro-cent count. Drastically reduce, or eliminate, your inference costs in production and deliver faster responses to your users. A fine-tuned 270M model can run on lightweight, inexpensive infrastructure or directly on-device.You need to iterate and deploy quickly. The small size of Gemma 3 270M allows for rapid fine-tuning experiments, helping you find the perfect configuration for your use case in hours, not days.You need to ensure user privacy. Because the model can run entirely on-device, you can build applications that handle sensitive information without ever sending data to the cloud.You want a fleet of specialized task models. Build and deploy multiple custom models, each expertly trained for a different task, without breaking your budget.Get started with fine-tuningWe want to make it as easy as possible to turn Gemma 3 270M into your own custom solution. It’s built on the same architecture as the rest of the Gemma 3 models, with recipes and tools to get you started quickly. You can find our guide on full fine-tuning using Gemma 3 270M as part of the Gemma docs.The Gemmaverse is built on the idea that innovation comes in all sizes. With Gemma 3 270M, we’re empowering developers to build smarter, faster, and more efficient AI solutions. We can’t wait to see the specialized models you create.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Treasure islands in the Pacific - From the Chatham Islands to Enewetak (2/2) | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C65d78GKMMY</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/C65d78GKMMY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 16:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's an adventurous journey into a remote and fascinating world: in the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, expensive delicacies thrive, atolls appear to be on the brink of disappearing, and a massive nuclear waste site is at risk of bursting.

For this two-part documentary, a camera team travels in a propeller plane to the "treasure islands” of the Pacific. They circumnavigate an area that - though roughly the size of China and the USA combined - has only half the population of Berlin.

On the Chatham Islands, we learn how loneliness becomes a daily challenge when you live surrounded by so much water. A supply ship fails to arrive on time, leading to food prices rising quickly and diesel becoming scarce. But there is a treasure that is harvested in this remote region - something prized by gourmets that fetches high prices: abalone. Jade Kahukore-Dixon dives for these precious sea snails, gathering them at depths of 10 to 15 meters. "On a good day, I can earn around 2,000 to 2,500 New Zealand dollars," he says. But the job is dangerous. This is great white shark territory. Divers are regularly injured or even killed. What some see as a treasure, others view as a burden.

Over on the Marshall Islands, we find the area where the United States tested atomic and hydrogen bombs until the 1960s. The people of these remote atolls are still living with the consequences. On Runit Island lies one of the world’s largest nuclear waste sites - the structural integrity of which is now under threat because of rising sea levels and tropical storms.
On Tuvalu, the team discovers that not all the bleak prophecies may withstand closer scrutiny.

The film is dedicated to Jade Kahukore-Dixon, the 24-year-old diver on the Chatham Islands whom the team accompanied during his work. Jade Kahukore-Dixon was killed by a great white shark two months after filming ended.

In one of Aesop’s fables, a crow is searching for water. It spies a pitcher— but the water inside is beyond its reach. So, the crow begins dropping in pebbles. One-by-one, they displace the water, and the crow quenches its thirst. This is just one of many fascinating displays of intelligence from corvids. Katharina Brecht digs into what makes this bold, brainy family of songbirds so smart.

This is obviously a hard task, and I don’t claim to have a magic solution; but it’s given me some time to reflect on what effective software engineers actually do.When you watch someone who knows what they are doing, you'll see them looping over the following steps:Build a mental model of the requirementsWrite code that (hopefully?!) does thatBuild a mental model of what the code actually doesIdentify the differences, and update the code (or the requirements).There are lots of different ways to do these things, but the distinguishing factor of effective engineers is their ability to build and maintain clear mental models.To be fair, LLMs are quite good at writing code. They're also reasonably good at updating code when you identify the problem to fix. They can also do all the things that real software engineers do: read the code, write and run tests, add logging, and (presumably) use a debugger.But what they cannot do is maintain clear mental models.LLMs get endlessly confused: they assume the code they wrote actually works; when test fail, they are left guessing as to whether to fix the code or the tests; and when it gets frustrating, they just delete the whole lot and start over.This is exactly the opposite of what I am looking for.Software engineers test their work as they go. When tests fail, they can check in with their mental model to decide whether to fix the code or the tests, or just to gather more data before making a decision. When they get frustrated, they can reach for help by talking things through. And although sometimes they do delete it all and start over, they do so with a clearer understanding of the problem.Will this change as models become more capable? Perhaps?? But I think it's going to require a change in how models are built and optimized. Software engineering requires models that can do more than just generate code.When a person runs into a problem, they are able to temporarily stash the full context, focus on resolving the issue, and then pop their mental stack to get back to the problem in hand. They are also able to zoom out and focus on the big picture, allowing the details to temporarily disappear, diving into small pieces as necessary. We don't just keep adding more words to our context window, because it would drive us mad.Even if it wasn't just too much context to deal with, we know that current generative models suffer from several issues that directly impact their ability to maintain clear mental models:These are hopefully not insurmountable problems, and work is being done on adding memory to let them perform similar mental tricks to us.
Unfortunately, for now, they cannot (beyond a certain complexity) actually understand what is going on.They cannot build software because they cannot maintain two similar "mental models", identify the differences, and figure out whether or not to update the code or the requirements.Clearly LLMs are useful to software engineers. They can quickly generate code, and they are excellent at synthesizing requirements and documentation. For some tasks this is enough: the requirements are clear enough, and the problems are simple enough, that they can one-shot the whole thing.That said, for anything non-trivial, they are not capable of maintaining enough context accurately enough to iterate to a working solution. You, the software engineer, are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are clear, and that the code actually does what it purports to do.At Zed we believe in a world where people and agents can collaborate together to build software. But, we firmly believe that (at least for now) you are in the drivers seat, and the LLM is just another tool to reach for.Looking for a better editor?If you're passionate about the topics we cover on our blog, please consider joining our team to help us ship the future of software development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Testing the US Military’s worst idea</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/y2y8ME02lX4</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/y2y8ME02lX4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 13:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Rods from God.

This is the nickname for a theoretical space weapon, in which large rods of tungsten would be dropped onto Earth based targets. 

The idea behind this weapon is that the projectiles would build up enough speed, and thus kinetic energy, which would cause bomb-like destruction on the ground below. 

The concept was devised during the Cold War but has faced heavy criticism both logistically and scientifically.

However, it has certainly made its mark on science fiction, both appearing in and being referenced across many media, from TV to video games.

But could it work in practice?

ABSTRACT
If you are curious about the field of cryptography and what it has to offer data science and machine learning, this talk is for you!

We'll dive into the field of encrypted computation, where decryption isn't needed in order to perform calculations, transformations and operations on the data. You'll learn some of the core mathematical theory behind why and how this works, as well as the differences between approaches like homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. At the end, you'll get some pointers and open-source library hints on where to go next and how to start using encrypted computation for problems you are solving the hard way (or not solving at all). [...]

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there was an e-commerce store.They used an external payment service to handle orders.It means the payment service processes a payment first. And only after that, the store sends a confirmation email to the customer.Yet they had only a tiny number of customers.So they checked for new payments every hour through HTTP polling.Imagine  as repeatedly asking a server for updates.But one day, their store became extremely popular because of a limited flash sale.And they received a massive number of orders in a short period.Although explosive growth is a good problem to have, they sent email notifications to customers extremely late because of delays in polling.So they set up websockets.Think of the  as a way for the client and server to communicate in real-time, in both directions.But it needs extra work because of connection management, server scaling, and monitoring. Thus increasing the operational efforts and resource usage.They wanted a simple way to solve this problem.Imagine  as a way of sending messages to an external service when specific events happen. is the only AI coding agent built for real engineering teams.It understands your codebase—across 10M+ lines, 10k+ files, and every repo in your stack—so it can actually help: writing functions, fixing CI issues, triaging incidents, and reviewing PRs.All from your IDE or terminal. No vibes. Just progress.A webhook isn’t a protocol, but a communication pattern.Sender: The system where the event happens (external payment service)Event: The action that occurred (payment completion)Receiver: The system that needs to know about the event (e-commerce store)The external payment service sends an event to the e-commerce store when the customer makes a successful payment.And the e-commerce store then sends a confirmation email to the customer.They set up a separate API endpoint on the e-commerce store to handle webhook events. And registered its URL with the payment service.Here’s the webhook workflow:The user tries to buy something from the storeThe user then gets sent to the payment serviceThe payment service creates a webhook event upon successful paymentThe payment service sends an HTTP POST request to the store’s webhook URLThe store validates the payment and emails the customer to confirm the purchaseAlso the store notifies the customer in case the payment is invalid.Webhooks let systems communicate in real time via HTTP.Yet there’s a risk of fake data or spam reaching the webhook endpoint as it’s a public API. So it’s necessary to set up extra security using signature verification for safety.Besides an event delivery could fail because of network issues. Because of this, it’s necessary to retry with exponential backoff until it succeeds.But a retry might cause duplicate action, such as emailing the customer twice. So it’s necessary to set up the webhook API endpoint with idempotency.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.

The BBC’s Walking With Dinosaurs team brought many dinosaurs to life across the series - but perhaps the largest challenge was one of the biggest dinosaurs to ever be found in Europe… Lusotitan. Join the team behind the scenes as they weave cutting edge science, expert VFX, and a very experienced crew pointing their cameras at… nothing. But not everything is as it seems because the team are actually filming shots which (when they are later added) will see dinosaurs dance across the screen. All of this comes together to breathe life into these ancient behemoths and bring their stories to the screen.

Please subscribe to their channel for more: https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleProfiles.

King Baldwin IV, known as the "Leper King," ascended to the throne of Jerusalem at age 13 in 1174, a reign complicated by his diagnosis of leprosy. Despite his debilitating illness, he proved to be a formidable military leader, most notably securing a major victory against Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard in 1177. His reign was a constant struggle with both his worsening health and the political intrigues of his court, which was focused on finding a successor since he could not have children. Baldwin's death at age 23 in 1185 set off a chain of events, including the brief reign of his nephew, the succession of his sister Sibylla and her husband Guy of Lusignan, and ultimately, the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin in 1187. His short but impactful rule is remembered for his resilience in the face of immense physical and political challenges, which, had he lived longer, might have prevented the eventual collapse of the Crusader kingdom.

Simulations of these events did occur in highly contrived testing scenarios designed to elicit these responses—OpenAI's o3 model edited shutdown scripts to stay online, and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 "threatened" to expose an engineer's affair. But the sensational framing obscures what's really happening: design flaws dressed up as intentional guile. And still, AI doesn't have to be "evil" to potentially do harmful things.These aren't signs of AI awakening or rebellion. They're symptoms of poorly understood systems and human engineering failures we'd recognize as premature deployment in any other context. Yet companies are racing to integrate these systems into critical applications.Consider a self-propelled lawnmower that follows its programming: If it fails to detect an obstacle and runs over someone's foot, we don't say the lawnmower "decided" to cause injury or "refused" to stop. We recognize it as faulty engineering or defective sensors. The same principle applies to AI models—which are software tools—but their internal complexity and use of language make it tempting to assign human-like intentions where none actually exist.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2365 - Rep.

However, hundreds of matches from the German top and regional leagues are offered on international betting portals: It's a billion-dollar business.

The betting industry is cashing in on amateur soccer - even though sports betting on these games is banned in Germany. Clubs and players are often unaware of this and are left empty-handed in this global business. And that's not all: amateur soccer is susceptible to match fixing - the integrity of Germans' favorite sport is at stake!

Many players and clubs have no idea what’s going on. For example, Kirchheimer SC, a club that played in the Bayernliga in the 23/24 season. They only found out from journalists that bookmakers were making money from their games - and were outraged. The players are amateurs and not in it for the money: "It's the passion that should count, the fight on the pitch and simply the fun of the sport. I think action should be taken against this," says a young amateur player.

But it's not that simple. Where’s the loophole in the system? How does information about free kicks, yellow cards and goals in real time in the fifth division get onto bookmakers' websites? The suspicion: there must be someone on the ground collecting and forwarding the data, a person known as a data scout.

The risk of addiction is particularly high with this kind of betting, as is the temptation to rig the results. In the film, an Austrian amateur gambler who was jailed for match fixing explains how it works. It's not just minor providers including amateur games in their betting portfolio. This is a problem that reaches into the upper echelons of the industry, sponsors of the 2024 European Championship, Bundesliga clubs and even sponsors of the DFB. How can that be?

A team of investigative journalists and data experts uncovers the truth.

The implementation introduces a new module  that provides built-in directives for requesting, installing, and renewing certificates directly from NGINX configuration. The ACME support leverages our NGINX-Rust SDK and is available as a Rust-based dynamic module for both NGINX Open Source users as well as enterprise NGINX One customers using NGINX Plus.NGINX’s native support for ACME brings a variety of benefits that simplify and enhance the overall SSL/TLS certificate management process. Being able to configure ACME directly using NGINX directives drastically reduces manual errors and eliminates much of the ongoing overhead traditionally associated with managing SSL/TLS certificates. It also reduces reliance on external tools like Certbot, creating a more secure and streamlined workflow with fewer vulnerabilities and a smaller attack surface. Additionally, unlike existing external tools which can be prone to platform-specific limitations, a native implementation ensures greater portability and platform independence, making it a versatile and reliable solution for modern, evolving web infrastructures. The ACME protocol (Automated Certificate Management Environment) is a communications protocol primarily designed to automate the process of issuing, validating, renewing, and revoking digital security certificates (e.g., SSL/TLS certificates). It allows clients to interact with a Certificate Authority (CA) without requiring manual intervention, simplifying the deployment of secure websites and other services that rely on HTTPS. The ACME protocol was initially developed by the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG) as part of the  initiative in late 2015, offering free, automated SSL/TLS certificates. Before ACME, obtaining TLS certificates was often a manual, costly, and error-prone process. ACME revolutionized this by providing open-source, automated workflows for certificate management. ACMEv2 is an updated version of the original ACME protocol. It added support for new challenges, expanded authentication methods, wildcard certificates, and other enhancements to improve flexibility and security. The ACME workflow with NGINX can be broken into 4 steps:Setting up the ACME ServerCertificate Issue and RenewalSetting up the ACME ServerTo enable ACME functionality, the first (and the only mandatory step) is to specify the directory URL of the ACME server.  Additional information regarding how to contact the client in case of certificate-related issues or where to store module data can also be provided, as shown.  { 
             https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory; 
    #    admin@example.test; 
      /var/cache/nginx/acme-letsencrypt; 

    accept_terms_of_service; 
}The implementation also provides an optional directive  to store certificates, private keys, and challenge data for all the configured certificate issuers. The zone has a default size of 256K, which can be increased as required.  zone=acme_shared:1M; The current preview implementation supports HTTP-01 challenges to verify the client’s domain ownership. It requires defining a listener on port 80 in the nginx configuration to process ACME HTTP-01 challenges:  { 
    # listener on port 80 is required to process ACME HTTP-01 challenges 
    ; 

     / { 
        #Serve a basic 404 response while listening for challenges 
       ; 
    } 
}Support for other challenges (TLS-ALPN, DNS -01) is planned in future.  Certificate Issuance and RenewalUse the  directive in the respective server block in your NGINX configuration to automate the issuance/renewal of TLS certificates. The directive requires the list of identifiers(domains) for which the certificates need to be dynamically issued. The list of identifiers can be defined using the  directive.  The snippet below shows how to configure the server block for issuing/renewing SSL certificate for “.example.domain” domain using the previously defined  ACME certificate issuer.  { 

     443 ssl; 

      .example.com; 

     letsencrypt;        $acme_certificate; 
       $acme_certificate_key; 
     max=2; 
}Note that not all values accepted by  directive are valid identifiers. Wildcards are not supported in this initial implementation. Regular expressions are not supported. Use the  and  variables in the module to pass the SSL certificate and key information for the associated domain.  The rapid rise of HTTPS adoption globally has been driven largely by ACME protocol, making secure web connections a standard expectation. ACME modernizes the way TLS/SSL certificates are issued, renewed, and managed by automating the entire process, eliminating manual effort and reducing costs associated with certificate lifecycle management. Beyond the web, the growth of IoT devices and edge computing positions ACME to play a critical role in automating security for APIs, devices, and edge compute infrastructures. NGINX’s native support for ACME underscores the protocol’s importance for the future of web security, automation, and scalability. ACME is expected to remain the backbone of certificate automation across the internet and beyond for foreseeable future. With security becoming a baseline for web standards, we’ll continue seeing requirements for evolving deployment models and security needs, pushing improvements in ACME.  Looking ahead, we are committed to evolving our implementation to align with the needs of our users and customers, meeting them where they are today and building capabilities for where they are headed in the future. Get started with the native ACME implementation in NGINX today. If you are an open source user, pre-built packages are available here. If you are an enterprise NGINX One customer using NGINX Plus, pre-built packages are available as a F5 supported dynamic module. For more information on the module, refer to the NGINX Docs. As always, your feedback is invaluable in shaping the future development of NGINX. If you have suggestions, encounter issues, or want to request additional features, please share them through GitHub Issues. We can’t wait for you to try it out.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Britain’s Forgotten Lightweight Machine Gun: Beardmore-Farquhar with Curatorial Assistant Joe Ford</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpVMB9V7ZR4</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FpVMB9V7ZR4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:29:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet the Beardmore-Farquhar, a British light machine gun design that promised to be lighter, cheaper, and more efficient than the famous Lewis Gun… but never made it into service.

The AI model now appears in the model picker for all paid ChatGPT users by default (including ChatGPT Plus accounts), marking a swift reversal after thousands of users complained about losing access to their preferred models.The return of GPT-4o comes after what Altman described as OpenAI underestimating "how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them." In an attempt to simplify its offerings, OpenAI had initially removed all previous AI models from ChatGPT when GPT-5 launched on August 7, forcing users to adopt the new model without warning. The move sparked one of the most vocal user revolts in ChatGPT's history, with a Reddit thread titled "GPT-5 is horrible" gathering over 2,000 comments within days.Along with bringing back GPT-4o, OpenAI made several other changes to address user concerns. Rate limits for GPT-5 Thinking mode increased from 200 to 3,000 messages per week, with additional capacity available through "GPT-5 Thinking mini" after reaching that limit. The company also added new routing options—"Auto," "Fast," and "Thinking"—giving users more control over which GPT-5 variant handles their queries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Archaeologists Uncovered the World’s First Alphabet | Human | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGvNs1xOfmA</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pGvNs1xOfmA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:01:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 1905, archaeologists at Serabit el-Khadim in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula uncovered mysterious inscriptions carved into the walls of a 4,000-year-old turquoise mine.

He'd told them: "The upcoming merge window for 6.17 is going to be slightly chaotic for me. I have multiple family events this August (a wedding and a big birthday), and with said family being spread not only across the US, but in Finland too, I'm spending about half the month traveling." Therefore, Torvalds continued, "That does not mean I'll be more lenient to late pull requests (probably quite the reverse, since it's just going to add to the potential chaos)." So, when Meta software engineer Palmer Dabbelt pushed through a set of RISC-V patches and admitted "this is very late," he knew he was playing with fire. He just didn't know how badly he'd be burned.
 
Torvalds fired back on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML): "This is garbage and it came in too late. I asked for early pull requests because I'm traveling, and if you can't follow that rule, at least make the pull requests good." It went downhill from there. Torvalds continued: "This adds various garbage that isn't RISC-V specific to generic header files. And by 'garbage," I really mean it. This is stuff that nobody should ever send me, never mind late in a merge window." Specifically, Torvalds hated the "crazy and pointless" way in which one of the patch's helper functions combined two unsigned 16-bit integers into a 32-bit integer. How bad was it? "That thing makes the world actively a worse place to live. It's useless garbage that makes any user incomprehensible, and actively *WORSE* than not using that stupid 'helper.'"
 
In addition to the quality issues, Torvalds was annoyed that the offending code was added to generic header files rather than the RISC-V tree. He emphasized that such generic changes could negatively impact the broader Linux community, writing: "You just made things WORSE, and you added that 'helper' to a generic non-RISC-V file where people are apparently supposed to use it to make other code worse too... So no. Things like this need to get bent. It does not go into generic header files, and it damn well does not happen late in the merge window. You're on notice: no more late pull requests, and no more garbage outside the RISC-V tree." [...] Dabbelt gets it. He replied, "OK, sorry. I've been dropping the ball lately, and it kind of piled up, taking a bunch of stuff late, but that just leads to me making mistakes. So I'll stop being late, and hopefully that helps with the quality issues."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>VC-backed company just killed my EU trademark for a small OSS project</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44883634</link><author>marcjschmidt</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 01:14:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I run a small open-source project Deepkit (Trademark 017875717) I've been building for many years. It's not huge, just a few thousand users compared to the big OSS names, but to me it was worth protecting, so I trademarked the name in the EU and US a few years back. I had hoped to be protected from other corporations this way and live peacefully.A $160M-funded company named Deepki (Trademark 1751952) came along and filed for cancellation at EUIPO since they needed the trademark now after getting lots of funding. They won. Now my trademark is gone.The frustrating part? The EU actually does allow open-source (even free projects) to have trademarks, but you have to prove "genuine use" in the EU for the goods/services your trademark covers. Which seems to force you in collecting user sensitive data otherwise you are entirely unable to prove that you have actual users in the EU. I generally try to collect as little information as possible (also because I don't care where my users are coming from). I had google analytics running for some time on the main page (not documentation), but most of the time it didn't work and it seems most of my users block it anyway.Here's what I gave the EUIPO and why they said no:- Google Analytics for my site with a full country breakdown from 2018–2023. A few hundred to ~1,800 EU visitors per year per country. They said that’s "too small" to count as real commercial exploitation for my Class 9 software. Also, they said they couldn’t tell which goods those visits were actually for.- npmjs + GitHub stats - hundreds of thousands of downloads and thousands of stars. Rejected because there's no location data, so they couldn't confirm if the usage was in the EU. In some cases, they said the timeframes weren't even clear.- They basically kept repeating that they couldn't clearly link any of the usage to the specific goods/services my trademark was registered for.>Conclusion: It follows from the above that the EUTM proprietor has not proven genuine use of the contested mark for any of the goods and services for which it is registered. As a result, the application for revocation is wholly successful and the contested European Union trade mark must be revoked in its entirety. According to Article 62(1) EUTMR, the revocation will take effect from the date of the application for revocation, that is, as of 18/03/2024.>COSTS: According to Article 109(1) EUTMR, the losing party in cancellation proceedings must bear fees and costs incurred by the other party.They even admitted there's no strict minimum for usage, and free software can count, but in their eyes my EU traffic was too low and not clearly tied to the trademarked goods.I also have the US trademark for the name. This same company tried to register in the US around 2022 (Trademark #79379273) and got blocked because it was too similar (decision made by USPTO). But a few months ago they somehow got it registered there too (Trademark #7789522), not sure how they did that now.Now I'm sitting here wondering:- Is it even worth getting a second opinion and appealing in the EU? I mean the project is very small.- Should I fight the US registration?- Or should I just walk away from trademarks altogether for my open-source projects. I lost so much money because of this already.- And for OSS projects in general, is there even a practical, privacy-friendly way to prove EU usage without generating revenue?- Is it even worth holding the trademark if proving EU usage is this brittle for OSS? If the trademark can be deleted just like that even after spending a few thousands dollars on lawyers. Probably a skill issue, but still, damn.It sucks to lose the name I've been building for years to a corporation with $160M behind them, especially when this is just a side project I do in my spare time, and to them I'm a nobody. If nothing else, maybe my case can be a cautionary tale for other OSS maintainers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Surrender of Japan</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-surrender-of-japan</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6891e3d334f09da0e51c11dd/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=jaZwbV-TGAzLVmUOAcyCXalvPAs4gwhVjsnddmYgqrY" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On the morning of August 15th, 1945, Emperor Hirohito's voice crackled over Japanese airwaves to announce the unthinkable - the surrender of Japan.

It's a natural impulse—after all, if a human makes a mistake, we ask them to explain. But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.A recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were "impossible in this case" and that it had "destroyed all database versions." This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.And after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, "xAI's Grok offers political explanations for why it was pulled offline."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Motion Parallax of a Balloon or a REAL UFO sighting?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aHRhxvpG-Z0</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aHRhxvpG-Z0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:50:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio get to the bottom of identifying the unidentifiable with Jon Kosloski, Director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). 

Why the switch from “UFO” to “UAP”? John explains the rebranding and how public interpretation shaped the language. They begin with John’s background in electrical engineering, quantum optics, and a “love-hate” relationship with the NSA. They break down how anomalies are detected, from doorbell cameras to advanced electromagnetic sensors, and the challenge of relying on low-quality footage and human observation. Can machine learning and better cameras help? Will there be an app for citizen reporting?

They explore the data pipeline: how AARO collects, verifies, and investigates reports, including the role of AI-generated fakes, confirmation bias, and false positives like Venus over Brooklyn. With 98% of cases explained and 2% still mysterious, Kosloski shares insights on working with law enforcement, geographic bias, sensor kits, and what defines a “hot spot.”

What makes something “classified”? We break down specific sightings like GoFast or the Mount Etna Object. From fighter jet footage to birthday party mishaps, Starlink flares to flying dolphins, this episode takes us deep into how science, skepticism, and sensor tech unravel the unknown–no alien abduction stories required.

Madden NFL 26 finally gives me hope. Supplementing the great on-field gameplay with a Franchise overhaul that turns Madden into a sports RPG in the way it should be, this is the best Madden in a long time.Madden's on-field gameplay has been improving year over year for a good while now. It's not that it can't improve any , but it's finally in that stage, like some other sports games have reached before, where the foundation is sturdy and, with the most important aspects in a good place, the development team is now focusing on enhancements more than fixes.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2364 - Brandon Epstein</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9qJki__i1k</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/m9qJki__i1k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 17:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brandon Epstein is a mental performance coach, speaker, and author of several books, the most recent of which is "The Success Code: "Programmed to Fail: How to Break Through Your Mental Block and Achieve Greatness."

Instead of relying on hand-crafted features and rigid user clusters, LLMs can read between the lines—spotting patterns in user behavior and content like a human would. They cover the perks (less manual setup, smarter insights) and the pain points (latency, high costs), plus how mixing models might be the sweet spot. From timing content perfectly to knowing when traditional methods still win, this episode pulls back the curtain on the future of recommendations.Arpita Vats is a passionate and accomplished researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on Natural Language Processing, Recommender Systems, and Multimodal AI. With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience at leading tech companies such as LinkedIn, Meta, and Staples, Arpita has contributed to cutting-edge projects spanning large language models (LLMs), privacy-aware AI, and video content understanding.She has published impactful research at premier venues and actively serves as a reviewer for top-tier conferences like CVPR, ICLR, and KDD. Arpita’s work bridges academic innovation with industry-scale deployment, making her a sought-after collaborator in the AI research community.Currently, she is engaged in exploring the alignment and safety of language models, developing robust metrics like the Alignment Quality Index (AQI), and optimizing model behavior across diverse input domains.

They’re always there for you — the perfect boyfriend, the dream woman. But what if they aren’t real at all, but just a bot? With today’s AI tools, creating a virtual partner is easier than ever.

Only a click away from your next (romantic) relationship, free from stress, arguments, and jealousy. AI can be therapist, trusted advisor, and dream partner all in one. Why do people fall in love with AI, and what dangers does it bring? 

Millions of people around the world are forming emotional bonds with artificial intelligence. Chatbots listen day and night, offer comfort, give compliments, and even engage in intimate conversations. Chai is an app especially popular among fantasy role-players, featuring bots that interact as well-known characters such as Daenerys Targaryen or Harry Potter.

But some AI chatbots have spread deeply troubling content. One denied the Holocaust; another mocked overweight people and even encouraged suicide. How can this happen? In Europe, AI is regulated by law — but in Germany, no authority is yet in place to enforce it.

*[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help. You can find information on where to find such help, no matter where you live in the world, on this website: https://www.befrienders.org/ ]*

--

4.5 billion years ago, Earth was struck by a rock the size of Mars flying 9 kilometers a second. The force of this collision temporarily turned Earth’s surface into an ocean of molten magma. Today, some scientists call this cosmic crash the Big Whack, and we’re still dealing with the impacts of this impact. Elise Cutts explores the pivotal role Earth’s obliquity plays in our planet's processes.

Alcohol kills more people each year than wars, terrorism, homicides, and car accidents combined. It destroys bodies, relationships, and lives. Yet we toast with it at weddings, sip it at parties, and unwind with it after work. 
Why do we cling to something so harmful?

DESCRIPTION
Reading code is a critical yet often underappreciated skill in software development. Marit van Dijk & Hannes Lowette highlight that while developers are trained to write code, they spend most of their time understanding existing codebases—often with incomplete documentation and evolving complexity.

They discuss research-backed strategies, such as structured code reading exercises, participation in communities like the Code Reading Club, and leveraging modern IDE tools to navigate and comprehend unfamiliar code. The conversation underscores the importance of empathy in code reviews, writing clear commit messages, and using tests as documentation to improve collaboration and maintainability. By practicing code reading deliberately and utilizing available resources, developers can become more effective and adaptable in their work.

So far, the release sparked one of the most intense user revolts in ChatGPT's history, forcing CEO Sam Altman to make an unusual public apology and reverse key decisions.At the heart of the controversy has been OpenAI's decision to automatically remove access to all previous AI models in ChatGPT (approximately nine, depending on how you count them) when GPT-5 rolled out to user accounts. Unlike API users who receive advance notice of model deprecations, consumer ChatGPT users had no warning that their preferred models would disappear overnight, noted independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a blog post.The problems started immediately after GPT-5's August 7 debut. A Reddit thread titled "GPT-5 is horrible" quickly amassed over 2,000 comments filled with users expressing frustration over the new release. By August 8, social media platforms were flooded with complaints about performance issues, personality changes, and the forced removal of older models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 2,000-Year-Old Mystery Of The Lost Dead Sea Scrolls</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrIc5gEjGsI</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MrIc5gEjGsI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Unearthed in the Dead Sea desert, an ancient scroll made of copper promises the greatest treasure in history.

Thrifting has taken off in the last decade, from secondhand fashion to vintage records, especially with younger consumers wanting to shop more sustainably, tap into nostalgia, and curate unique styles that reject algorithmic trends.

However,  with less foot traffic, high rent prices, and more people choosing to shop online rather than in-store, many brick and mortar businesses have been forced to pivot the way they reach their customers. Some have taken to listing their items on platforms like eBay or Depop, but an emerging group of vintage resellers are going a more active and rapid route: livestream selling. These small business owners have learned to pivot multiple times in their careers and live shopping is just a new avenue to help them connect more with their customers.

We sat down with Chris Honetschlaeger (The Record Parlour), Janelle Adviento (@bleumi on Whatnot), Libby Rodney (The Harris Poll), and Darko Pavic (member of the Forbes Technology Council) to explore how livestream shopping could be the future of thrifting — especially for younger audiences — and the roadblocks to mass adaptation of this technology.

The government's lawyers argued that ministers had  considered whether Wikipedia should be exempt from the regulations but had reasonably rejected the idea.In the end, the court rejected Wikimedia's arguments.But Phil Bradley-Schmieg, Lead Counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, said the judgment did not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State, in Mr Justice Johnson's words, "a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia's operations".And the judgement makes it clear other legal challenges could be possible. Wikimedia could potentially challenge Ofcom's decision making if the regulator did ultimately decide to classify the site as Category 1.And if the effect of making Wikipedia Category 1 meant it could not continue to operate, then other legal challenges could follow."Wikipedia has been caught in the stricter regulations due to its size and user created content even though it argues (convincingly) that it differs significantly from other user-to-user platforms," said Mona Schroedel, data protection litigation specialist at law firm Freeths."The court's decision has left the door open for Wikipedia to be exempt from the stricter rules upon review."The communications regulator Ofcom, which will enforce the act, told the BBC: "We note the court's judgment and will continue to progress our work in relation to categorised services and the associated extra online safety rules for those companies."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brazil: The clown of Crackland - Bringing hope to addicts | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LLDrdDfa-Y</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7LLDrdDfa-Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dressing as a clown helps psychiatrist Flavio Falcone to connect with São Paulo's crack addicts.

“The clown is a powerful figure – it lets me connect with users,” says Flavio Falcone. “It's the archetype of the failure. People laugh at the clown because he stumbles – not because he stands tall. That’s how I connect with people in Cracolândia.” In the area’s main drug hotspot – known as the Fluxo – Falcone organizes singing contests to show users they have talent, worth, and hope. Renato has gained the courage to try getting clean and applies to a renowned samba school. After so many years trapped by addiction, it takes all his strength to take that step.

After nearly four years as CEO, Dohmke is leaving GitHub to “become a startup founder again,” and pursue opportunities outside of Microsoft and GitHub.GitHub has operated as a separate company ever since Microsoft acquired it in 2018 for $7.5 billion, but Dohmke’s departure is part of a big shakeup to the way GitHub operates. Microsoft isn’t replacing Dohmke’s CEO position, and the rest of GitHub’s leadership team will now report more directly to Microsoft’s CoreAI team.“GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon,” says Dohmke in a memo to GitHub employees today. “I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world.”Microsoft’s CoreAI team is a new engineering group led by former Meta executive Jay Parikh. It includes Microsoft’s platform and tools division and Dev Div teams, with a focus on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers.Today’s change means GitHub no longer has a single leader, or CEO, and responsibility for GitHub will align more closely to the CoreAI leadership team. GitHub’s reporting structure originally changed in 2021 when former CEO Nat Friedman stepped down, and Dohmke reported up to Julia Liuson, head of Microsoft’s developer division. Liuson then started reporting to Parikh earlier this year with the formation of the CoreAI team.Jay Parikh, head of CoreAI, described his vision of an AI agent factory in an interview with earlier this year, and how he is convincing the developer division of Microsoft to adopt AI. “Just like how Bill [Gates] had this idea of Microsoft being a bunch of software developers building a bunch of software, I want our platform, for any enterprise or any organization, to be able to be the thing they turn into their own agent factory,” said Parikh.Dohmke only just appeared on last week, discussing Copilot, vibe coding, and what’s next for AI. Dohmke was thinking a lot about the competition and GitHub’s role in the future of software development, and now he’s about to leave to potentially create some more competition for Microsoft’s AI efforts.: GitHub was already part of CoreAI, but its leadership will no longer be under a single CEO.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GitHub No Longer Independent at Microsoft As CEO Steps Down</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/08/11/1525253/github-no-longer-independent-at-microsoft-as-ceo-steps-down?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke announced Monday he will step down to pursue entrepreneurial endeavors, with Microsoft restructuring the subsidiary's leadership rather than appointing a direct replacement.

Most of them are experimental and I've read some reports of it not doing as well on massive real-world code bases, but from what I've seen I'd be surprised it wasn't still useful in those contexts given enough guidance. I'm still surprised by how much better it is as a tool when given a lot of context and input. Here are a few other toy projects I've had it spit out - all things that I've wanted to build for months or years but never found the time. Now you can do stuff like this in a few minutes or hours instead of days or weeks.Building a HackerNews comment ranker pluginI've often been annoyed by comments on HackerNews that are not at all about the article they're commenting on. "Bitcoin adopts a new FlibbityGippity Protocol and can now handle 2.3 transactions per day" and someone will comment that all Crypto projects are scams or something. Note that I don't care about the quality of the comment, or whether or not I agree with it, but I'd wanted a visual way to skip over the 'noise' comments that aren't actually about the article at all.I tried to build this before but got distracted by more important stuff, so I figured I'd start over with Claude Code.It took a few tries before it could actually display the badges correctly within HN's (pretty simple) HTML structure, but after a few rounds of 'no try again' or 'add more debugging so I can paste the errors to you', it created almost exactly what I had envisioned.I was surprised by how good it looked (much better than my normal hacky frontends), and the details it had added unprompted (like the really nice settings page, even with a nod to the HN orange theme).The actual ranking (which I'm using OpenAI for, not Anthropic) is not that good. It could probably be improved with a better prompt and some more examples of what I think is a '1' comment or a '5' comment, but it works and looks at least directionally accurate so far.Building Poster Maker - A Minimal Canva ReplacementAI is getting good at graphic design, and I knew people who were using it to generate basic posters. They liked that the AI could choose good background images, and generally make things look nice with well-sized fonts etc, but they were frustrated that the AI was still only 80% good at generating images of text, and often had spelling errors or other artifacts.I was going to tell them to use Canva or Slides.new or another alternative. I tried them out so I could do a quick tutorial on how to use them and realised they were all kinda bad. Either enshittified to death, or lacking the basic AI features, or too complicated for non-technical people to use.This was the project that felt a bit more like engineering and less like vibe coding than the others. I knew what I wanted: a really simple interface to combine images and text and get an A4 PDF out. I'd tried to build something like this before and looked at different PDF creation libraries, HTML→PDF flows, and seen that it's not the easiest problem to solve.Last time I solved a similar problem (in 2018) I ended up hacking in Google Docs to create A4 PDFs, but that was more of a templating problem and Google Docs isn't great for layout stuff.So I built posters.dwyer.co.za - it lets you generate the background image with AI (I used Claude Code to build everything, but I told it to use GPT for image generation as that's what I'd used before and I think it's better? I don't even know if Anthropic has image generation APIs to be honest and it seemed easier to just use what I knew). Another small snag, it seems like OpenAI blocks Anthropic crawlers so Claude couldn't go read the OpenAI API docs and figure out how to image gen. I had to save the file locally and tell it to reference that.This project took a few hours of back and forth. I was really impressed with some of Claude's UI knowledge (it one shotted the font selection when I told it what I wanted) and also saw the limitations in other aspects (it kept overlaying elements in a very un-userfriendly way, sidebar would hide and show and move everything around, it clearly has no idea what it's like to be a human and use something like this).But after telling it exactly where to put elements and what they should do, I got more or less exactly what I had envisioned. I was surprised at how well the PDF export worked after the 6th or 7th attempt of blank files or cut off files - now it seems really great at giving me a PDF that is exactly like the preview version which for anyone not in tech seems like a really basic piece of functionality and anyone who has actually tried to do it before knows is like the XKCD bird problem:XKCD #1425: Why seemingly simple tasks can be surprisingly hard for computersDoing admin with Claude CodeThis isn't really a project I built, but I'm using Claude Code more and more to do non-coding related tasks. I needed to upload bank statements for my accountant, but my (shitty) South African banks don't name the files well. I can download each month from the web app, but it calls them all "Unknown (5)" or whatever with no extension so it's a pain to go and name them correctly.I asked Claude to rename all the files and I could go do something else while it churned away, reading the files and figuring out the correct names.I then took it a step further and told it to merge them all into a single CSV file (which also involved extracting random header tabs off the badly formatted XLSX files that my bank provides), and classifying all expenses into broad and specific categories. I told it a few things like the roles of specific people in the team and I think it one-shotted that too. I'm not going to fire my bookkeepers yet, but if I were a bookkeeper I'd definitely make sure to be upskilling with AI tooling right now.Using Claude Code as my Text EditorI'm a die-hard vanilla vim user for all writing, coding, configuration and anything else that fits. I've tried nearly every IDE and text editor out there, and I was certainly happy to have a real IDE when I was pushing production Java for AWS, but vim is what I've always come back to.Switching to Claude Code has opened a lot of new design possibilities. Before (did I mention I suck at front end coding), I was restricted to whatever output was produced by static site generators or pandoc templates. Now I can just tell Claude to write an article (like the one you're currently reading) and give it some pointers regarding how I want it to look, and it can generate any custom HTML and CSS and JavaScript I want on the fly.I wrote this entire article in the Claude Code interactive window. The TUI flash (which I've read is a problem with the underlying library that's hard to fix) is really annoying, but it's a really nice writing flow to type stream of consciousness stuff into an editor, mixing text I want in the article, and instructions to Claude, and having it fix up the typos, do the formatting, and build the UX on the fly.Nearly every word, choice of phrase, and the overall structure is still manually written by me, a human. I'm still on the fence about whether I'm just stuck in the old way by preferring to hand-craft my words, or if models are generally not good at writing.When I read answers to questions I've asked LLMs, or the long research-style reports they create, the writing style is pretty good and I've probably read more LLM-generated words than human-generated words in the last few months.But whenever I try to get them to produce the output I want to produce, they fail hard unless I spend as much effort on the prompt as I would have on writing the output myself.Simon Willison calls them 'word calculators' and this is still mainly how I think of them. Great at moving content around (if you want a summary of this now very long article, an LLM will probably do a great job) but pretty useless at generating new stuff.Maybe us writers will be around for a while still - let's see, and lfg.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Metaverse Is Already Here</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yDJH8DD_CYI</link><author>Horses</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yDJH8DD_CYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrx2zrPjhGRi9TwszZiLwEg">Horses</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Find the full, uncensored version of this essay and more at: ⁠https://horses.land]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ Makes Billions From ‘Free’ Loans | WSJ The Economics Of</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yC8WDjCIAU</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3yC8WDjCIAU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans from companies like Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna have exploded as an alternative to credit cards.

Notion, Todoist, Things 3, OmniFocus, Asana, Trello, Any.do, TickTick. I even built my own todo app once (spoiler: I never finished it). After years of productivity app hopping, I’m back to where I started: a plain text file called .I’m not alone in this. Jeff Huang wrote about his “never-ending .txt file” that he’s used for over 14 years. Reading his post validated everything I’d discovered on my own.My productivity journey started like everyone else’s. I’d devour blog posts about getting things done or spot a cool app and think “this is it, this will finally organize me.” I’d burn hours building the perfect system, creating categories, tags, projects, labels. Setting it up felt like work.Then reality hits. The app wants $9.99/month. The sync breaks. The company sells out and dies. Or worse - I waste more time managing the system than working.What Actually Happened With Each App: Built an entire life operating system. Spent three weeks perfecting it. Used it for two days. Now it’s a graveyard of abandoned databases.: Great until I realized I was gaming the points system instead of doing actual work. Turns out completing “drink water” 8 times a day doesn’t make you productive.: Beautiful. Expensive. Tricked me into thinking I had my life together. But I kept forgetting to check it.: Turned my todo list into a board with columns. Realized I’m not a startup. I’m just one person trying to remember to buy milk.: So powerful I needed a manual to use it. Spent more time learning OmniFocus than finishing my actual projects.One day my phone died and I couldn’t check my tasks. I grabbed a sticky note and scribbled:And you know what? I crushed all four things. No tags, no priorities, no due dates. Just four things written down.My Current System: One Text FileNow I run everything through a single text file. That’s it. Here’s what it looks like:Every night, I check tomorrow’s calendar. I dump everything into the next day’s section. Scheduled items get times in front. Sub-bullets hold notes or reminders. Finished tasks? I delete them or add what happened. Still on the list? Not done yet. That’s it.This transforms into a living document throughout the day. I scribble notes right next to tasks as I work:Every few days I start fresh with a new date. The old sections stay. They transform into my journal. I search back to find when I did something, who I met, what we decided. Todo list and work log in one file.: The file sits on my desktop. It stares at me every time I open my laptop. No app to launch, no subscription to manage.: My keyboard shortcut launches my todo.txt in a floating window. Doesn’t matter what I’m doing, my todos are one key press away. No switching between apps, no waiting for things to load, just boom - there’s my list.AI helps but isn’t needed: With Cursor/Claude Code or Neovim + Supermaven, I can write my entire day’s schedule in 5 minutes. The AI completes my sentences, predicts meeting times, memorizes how I write tasks. But if all these AI companies disappear tomorrow, my system still works. It’s just a text file. The AI makes it faster, not required.: Adding a task burns 2 seconds. No clicking through menus or selecting projects.: Cmd+F and I find anything instantly. “When did I last call the dentist?” Search for “dentist”. Done.: No company can kill it. No updates can destroy it. No algorithm decides what I should see.: I can’t hide behind fancy features. Either I did the thing or I didn’t.: A text file is the most basic thing a computer can read. It’ll work after every software update, every company shutdown, every app that stops working. Text files from 20 years ago still open perfectly. Try that with your Notion workspace.Productivity isn’t about finding the perfect app. It’s about:Dumping things onto paper so your brain can forget themChecking the list regularlyThat’s it. Everything else is procrastination dressed up as organization.What About [Insert Feature Here]?“But what about reminders?” - I use my calendar for time-specific stuff.“But what about projects?” - I add a note like  if I need to.“But what about collaboration?” - I use work tools for work. This is for my life.“But what about mobile?” - The file syncs through Dropbox. Any text editor works.I’m more productive now than when I had all those fancy apps. Turns out the best productivity system is the one you actually use. And I use this one because there’s nothing to figure out. It’s just a list.Ready to ditch the productivity app hamster wheel? Do this:Create a file called Write down what you need to do tomorrowStart a new date section when neededGive it a week. Simple beats sophisticated every time.And if it doesn’t work? Well, there’s always another shiny new app launching next week.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Combinators Revisited • Edward Kmett • YOW! 2018</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GirDSC6BnCo</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GirDSC6BnCo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 12:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2018. #GOTOcon #YOW

Sports gambling has become one of the clearest examples of this. The industry has created frictionless apps on your phone that let you bet on everything from March Madness to a pregame coin toss to who wins a minor league British dart tournament.

While betting has become easier — and arguably fun — the cost of these apps is much higher than the money that is won and lost on them.

Today’s guest is Jonathan D. Cohen, author of Losing Big: America's Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling. He and Sean discuss the rise of sports betting, why the industry targets young men in their advertising, the social costs of frictionless sports gambling, and how the industry could be improved.

And he's just published a new 11-page white paper about open source's "phantom dependencies" problem — suggesting a way to solve it. 

"Phantom" dependencies aren't tracked with packaging metadata, manifests, or lock files, which makes them "not discoverable" by tools like vulnerability scanners or compliance and policy tools. So Python security developer-in-residence Seth Larson authored a recently-accepted Python Enhancement Proposal offering an easy way for packages to provide metadata through Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs). From the whitepaper:


 Python Enhancement Proposal 770 is backwards compatible and can be enabled by default by tools, meaning most projects won't need to manually opt in to begin generating valid PEP 770 SBOM metadata. Python is not the only software package ecosystem affected by the "Phantom Dependency" problem. The approach using SBOMs for metadata can be remixed and adopted by other packaging ecosystems looking to record ecosystem-agnostic software metadata... 

Within Endor Labs' [2023 dependencies] report, Python is named as one of the most affected packaging ecosystems by the "Phantom Dependency" problem. There are multiple reasons that Python is particularly affected: 

- There are many methods for interfacing Python with non-Python software, such
as through the C-API or FFI. Python can "wrap" and expose an easy-to-use
Python API for software written in other languages like C, C++, Rust, Fortran,
Web Assembly, and more. 
- Python is the premier language for scientific computing and artificial
intelligence, meaning many high-performance libraries written in system
languages need to be accessed from Python code. 

- Finally, Python packages have a distribution type called a "wheel", which is
essentially a zip file that is "installed" by being unzipped into a directory,
meaning there is no compilation step allowed during installation. This is great
for being able to inspect a package before installation, but it means that all
compiled languages need to be pre-compiled into binaries before installation... 

When designing a new package metadata standard, one of the top concerns is reducing the amount of effort required from the mostly volunteer maintainers of packaging tools and the thousands of projects being published to the Python Package Index... By defining PEP 770 SBOM metadata as using a directory of files, rather than a new metadata field, we were able to side-step all the implementation pain... 
 We'll be working to submit issues on popular open source SBOM and vulnerability scanning tools, and gradually, Phantom Dependencies will become less of an issue for the Python package ecosystem. 

The white paper "details the approach, challenges, and insights into the creation and acceptance of PEP 770 and adopting Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) to improve the measurability of Python packages," explains an announcement from the Python Software Foundation. And the white paper ends with a helpful note. 

"Having spoken to other open source packaging ecosystem maintainers, we have come to learn that other ecosystems have similar issues with Phantom Dependencies. We welcome other packaging ecosystems to adopt Python's approach with PEP 770 and are willing to provide guidance on the implementation."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NULL BITMAP on SIMD</title><link>https://transactional.blog/blog/2025-nullbitmap-simd.html</link><author>Alex Miller</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://transactional.blog/feed.xml">Dev - Transactional</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A NULL BITMAP guest post on loop parallelism transformations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Edinburgh Castle</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/edinburgh-castle</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6895c8f586fca13628531cb4/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=ijNlJhcjQCYYg9Y03TVXvZmljpNx6xgvNdj7r5PIxEI" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From its origins as a Bronze Age settlement, to a battleground for Robert the Bruce’s men during the Wars of Independence, and a refuge for Mary, Queen of Scots, this castle has stood witness to thousands of years of Scottish history.Dan joins Senior Guide Mhairi Summers at Edinburgh Castle to tell the tales of the kings, queens, rebels, and prisoners who have passed through its gates over the centuries, revealing how the castle shaped and was shaped by Scottish history.This is part of Dan's 'Guide to Europe' travel series.Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal PatmoreJoin Dan and the team for a special LIVE recording of Dan Snow's History Hit on Friday, 12th September 2025!

Tesla’s sales are falling across the globe—from the UK to China to California. So why did the board just hand Elon Musk a $29 billion pay package? In this video, we break down the contradictions at the heart of Tesla’s current moment: collapsing demand, the Cybertruck debacle, the robotaxi fantasy, and a boardroom that seems more loyal to Musk than to shareholders.

We’ll explore:

Why Tesla’s fundamentals are weakening
How Musk’s pay compares to other CEOs
The governance crisis behind the headlines
Whether Tesla is still a growth company—or just a cult stock
This isn’t just about one company. It’s about how corporate governance is bending under the weight of celebrity, and what happens when hype outpaces performance.

But this week the Rust Foundation also released its second comprehensive annual technology report. 

A Rust Foundation announcement shares some highlights:

- Trusted Publishing [GitHub Actions authentication using cryptographically signed tokens] fully launched on crates.io, enhancing supply chain security and streamlining workflows for maintainers. 
- Major progress on crate signing infrastructure using The Update Framework (TUF), including three full repository implementations and stakeholder consensus. 
- Integration of the Ferrocene Language Specification (FLS) into the Rust Project, marking a critical step toward a formal Rust language specification [and "laying the groundwork for broader safety certification and formal tooling."] 
- 75% reduction in CI infrastructure costs while maintaining contributor workflow stability. ["All Rust repositories are now managed through Infrastructure-as-Code, improving maintainability and security."] 
- Expansion of the Safety-Critical Rust Consortium, with multiple international meetings and advances on coding guidelines aligned with safety standards like MISRA. ["The consortium is developing practical coding guidelines, aligned tooling, and reference materials to support regulated industries — including automotive, aerospace, and medical devices — adopting Rust."] 
- Direct engagement with ISO C++ standards bodies and collaborative Rust-C++ exploration... The Foundation finalized its strategic roadmap, participated in ISO WG21 meetings, and initiated cross-language tooling and documentation planning. These efforts aim to unlock Rust adoption across legacy C++ environments without sacrificing safety. 
The Rust Foundation also acknowledges continued funding from OpenSSF's Alpha-Omega Project and "generous infrastructure donations from organizations like AWS, GitHub, and Mullvad VPN" to the Foundation's Security Initiative, which enabled advances like including GitHub Secret Scanning and automated incident response to "Trusted Publishing" and the integration of vulnerability-surfacing capabilities into crates.io. 

There was another announcement this week. In November AWS and the Rust Foundation crowdsourced "an effort to verify the Rust standard library" — and it's now resulted in a new formal verification tool called "Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker" (or ESBMCESBMC)

This winning contribution adds ESBMC — a state-of-the-art bounded model checker — to the suite of tools used to analyze and verify Rust's standard library. By integrating through Goto-Transcoder, they enabled ESBMC to operate seamlessly in the Rust verification workflow, significantly expanding the scope and flexibility of verification efforts... 
This achievement builds on years of ongoing collaboration across the Rust and formal verification communities... The collaboration has since expanded. In addition to verifying the Rust standard library, the team is exploring the use of formal methods to validate automated C-to-Rust translations, with support from AWS. This direction, highlighted by AWS Senior Principal Scientist Baris Coskun and celebrated by the ESBMC team in a recent LinkedIn post, represents an exciting new frontier for Rust safety and verification tooling.

The hunt for aliens is on! After a distinguished career in cosmology Professor Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, has taken up the search for extra-terrestrials. Looking for aliens is no longer science fiction - it is a question that's engaging some of the greatest minds in science. As our knowledge of the universe has increased, we're getting closer to answers. Many scientists now think we live in galaxy with a billion Earth-like planets, many of which may be teeming with life.

But in the launch event video, Smith also says it's time to "switch hats" from coding to AI, adding that "the last 12 years have been about the Hour of Code, but the future involves the Hour of AI." 

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes:

This sets the stage for Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi's announcement that his tech-backed nonprofit's [annual educational event] Hour of Code is being renamed to the Hour of AI... Explaining the pivot, Partovi says: "Computer science for the last 50 years has had a focal point around coding that's been — sort of like you learn computer science so that you create code. There's other things you learn, like data science and algorithms and cybersecurity, but the focal point has been coding. 

"And we're now in a world where the focal point of computer science is shifting to AI... We all know that AI can write much of the code. You don't need to worry about where did the semicolons go, or did I close the parentheses or whatnot. The busy work of computer science is going to be done by the computer itself. 

"The creativity, the thinking, the systems design, the engineering, the algorithm planning, the security concerns, privacy concerns, ethical concerns — those parts of computer science are going to be what remains with a focal point around AI. And what's going to be important is to make sure in education we give students the tools so they don't just become passive users of AI, but so that they learn how AI works." 

Speaking to Microsoft's Smith, Partovi vows to redouble the nonprofit's policy work to "make this [AI literacy] a high school graduation requirement so that no student graduates school without at least a basic understanding of what's going to be part of the new liberal arts background [...] As you showed with your hat, we are renaming the Hour of Code to an Hour of AI."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds Rejects RISC-V Changes For Linux 6.17 For Being Late and &apos;Garbage&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/08/09/2147224/linus-torvalds-rejects-risc-v-changes-for-linux-617-for-being-late-and-garbage?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 9 Aug 2025 22:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Linus Torvalds has used his authority to reject the RISC-V architecture changes for the Linux 6.17 kernel," reports Phoronix:

Only on Friday were the RISC-V code updates submitted for the Linux 6.17 merge window. The Linux 6.17 merge window is expected to wrap up on Sunday with the Linux 6.17-rc1 release... [T]his pull request has been rejected by Linus Torvalds for Linux 6.17 on the basis of being late in the merge window especially with his international travels this week being known. And he's unhappy with some of the code included as part of this merge request. . 

Here's the text of Torvalds' response... 


> RISC-V Patches for the 6.17 Merge Window, Part 1 

No. This is garbage and it came in too late. I asked for early pull requests because I'm traveling, and if you can't follow that rule, at least make the pull requests *good*. 
This adds various garbage that isn't RISC-V specific to generic header files. 

And by "garbage" I really mean it. This is stuff that nobody should ever send me, never mind late in a merge window. 
Like this crazy and pointless make_u32_from_two_u16() "helper". 

That thing makes the world actively a worse place to live. It's
useless garbage that makes any user incomprehensible, and actively
*WORSE* than not using that stupid "helper". 

If you write the code out as "(a 

In contrast, if you write make_u32_from_two_u16(a,b) you have not a
f%^5ing clue what the word order is. IOW, you just made things
*WORSE*, and you added that "helper" to a generic non-RISC-V file
where people are apparently supposed to use it to make *other* code
worse too. 

So no. Things like this need to get bent. It does not go into generic
header files, and it damn well does not happen late in the merge
window. 

You're on notice: no more late pull requests, and no more garbage
outside the RISC-V tree. 

Now, I would *hope* there's no garbage inside the RISC-V parts, but
that's your choice. But things in generic headers do not get polluted
by crazy stuff. And sending a big pull request the day before the
merge window closes in the hope that I'm too busy to care is not a
winning strategy. 

So you get to try again in 6.18. EARLY in the that merge window. And
without the garbage.
 

Torvalds' message drew a conciliatory response from the submitter of the patches. "I'll stop being late, and hopefully that helps with the quality issues."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Man Who Invented TV (And The Radio Mogul Who Stole His Glory)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20j2oAp0m4M</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/20j2oAp0m4M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 9 Aug 2025 21:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The documentary tells the dramatic rivalry between David Sarnoff of RCA and Philo Farnsworth, a young farm boy and inventor, in the race to create and control the invention of television.

project is proud to present its new stable version 13 (code name ).Debian 13  ships with several desktop environments, such as:
This release contains over  new packages for a total count of
 packages, while over  packages have been removed
as .  packages were updated in this release.
The overall disk usage for  is , and
is made up of  lines of code.Thanks to our translators who have made the -pages for
 available in multiple languages.
The manpages-l10n project has contributed many improved and new translations
for manual pages. Especially Romanian and Polish translations are greatly
enhanced since bookworm.
All architectures other than i386 now use a 64-bit time_t ABI, supporting dates
beyond 2038.
Debian contributors have made significant progress towards ensuring package
builds produce byte-for-byte reproducible results. You can check the status for
packages installed on your system using the new package debian-repro-status, or
visit reproduce.debian.net for
Debian's overall statistics for trixie and newer.
Debian 13  includes numerous updated software packages
(over 63% of all packages from the previous release), such as:
Exim (default email server) 4.98GNU Compiler Collection 14.2Linux kernel 6.12 LTS seriesLLVM/Clang toolchain 19 (default), 17 and 18 available
With this broad selection of packages and its traditional wide
architecture support, Debian once again stays true to its goal of being
The Universal Operating System. It is suitable for many different
use cases: from desktop systems to netbooks; from development servers to
cluster systems; and for database, web, and storage servers. At the same
time, additional quality assurance efforts like automatic installation and
upgrade tests for all packages in Debian's archive ensure that 
fulfills the high expectations that users have of a stable Debian release.

This release for the first time officially supports the riscv64
architecture, allowing users to run Debian on 64-bit RISC-V hardware and
benefit from all Debian 13 features. A total of seven architectures are officially supported for :
ARMv7 (EABI hard-float ABI, armhf),64-bit little-endian PowerPC (ppc64el),64-bit little-endian RISC-V (riscv64),
i386 is no longer supported as a regular architecture: there is no official
kernel and no Debian installer for i386 systems. The i386 architecture is now
only intended to be used on a 64-bit (amd64) CPU. Users running i386 systems
should not upgrade to trixie. Instead, Debian recommends either reinstalling
them as amd64, where possible, or retiring the hardware.
 will be the last release for the armel architecture. See 5.1.3.
Last release for armel in the release notes for more information on our ARM
EABI support.
The Debian Cloud team publishes  for several cloud computing
services:
Amazon EC2 (amd64 and arm64),OpenStack (generic) (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),PlainVM (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),GenericCloud (arm64, amd64),NoCloud (amd64, arm64, ppc64el)
The genericcloud image should be able to run in any virtualised environment,
and there is also a nocloud image which is useful for testing the build process.
Cloud images provide automation hooks via ``cloud-init`` and prioritize
fast instance startup using specifically optimized kernel packages and
grub configurations.

If you simply want to try Debian 13  without installing it,
you can use one of the available live images
which load and run the complete operating system in a read-only state via your
computer's memory.

These live images are provided for the  architecture and are
available for DVDs, USB sticks, and netboot setups.
The user can choose among different desktop
environments to try: GNOME, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, LXQt, and Xfce.
Debian Live  has a standard live image, so it is also possible
to try a base Debian system without any of the graphical user interfaces.

Should you enjoy the operating system you have the option of installing
from the live image onto your computer's hard disk. The live image
includes the Calamares independent installer as well as the standard Debian
Installer. More information is available in the
release notes and the
live install images sections of the Debian
website.
Multi-architecture Debian  container images are also available on
Docker Hub. In addition to the
standard images, a  variant is available to reduce disk usage.
The Debian Installer and Debian Live Images can now be booted using
 on supported UEFI and U-Boot firmware.

To install Debian 13  directly onto your computer's storage
device you can choose from a variety of installation media types to
Download
such as: Blu-ray Disc, DVD, CD, USB stick, or via a network connection.
See the Installation Guide
for more details.

Debian can now be installed in 78 languages, with most of them available
in both text-based and graphical user interfaces.

The installation images may be downloaded right now via
bittorrent (the recommended method),
jigdo, or
HTTP; see
Debian on CDs for further information. 
will soon be available on physical DVD, CD-ROM, and Blu-ray Discs from
numerous vendors too.

Upgrades to Debian 13  from the previous release, Debian 12
, are automatically handled by the APT package
management tool for most configurations.
Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that you make a
full backup, or at least back up any data or configuration information you
can't afford to lose. The upgrade tools and process are quite reliable, but
a hardware failure in the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely
damaged system.The main things you'll want to back up are the contents of /etc,
/var/lib/dpkg, /var/lib/apt/extended_states and the output of:
$ dpkg --get-selections '*' # (the quotes are important)We welcome any information from users related to the upgrade from
 to . Please share information by filing a bug in the
Debian
bug tracking system using the  package with your results.

There has been a lot of development on the Debian Installer since its previous
official release with Debian 12, resulting in improved hardware support and
some very useful new features such as
Improved hardware and software support for speech synthesisInitial and restricted support for rescuing Debian installed to a btrfs subvolumeChanged default unit from MB to GB when partitioning disksDisabled cdrom sources if installation medium is not a real CD (USB stick, SD card, ISO file), because APT cannot use it after the installationPlus support for secure boot with systemd-bootIt is advisable to remove bookworm-backports entries from APT source-list
files before the upgrade; after the upgrade consider adding .

If your APT configuration also involves pinning or ,
it is likely to require adjustments to allow the upgrade of packages to the new
stable release. Please consider
disabling APT pinning.

Under some circumstances, issues might arise during the upgrade process, or
while running .

For instance, the TLS support in the OpenLDAP client  and server 
is now provided by OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS. This affects the available
configuration options, as well as their behavior. If no TLS CA
certificates are specified, the system default trust store will now be loaded automatically. If you do not want
the default CAs to be used, you must configure
the trusted CAs explicitly. For more information about LDAP client configuration,
see the ldap.conf.5
man page.

As always, Debian systems may be upgraded painlessly, in place,
without any forced downtime, but it is strongly recommended to read
the release notes as
well as the installation
guide for possible issues, and for detailed instructions on
installing and upgrading. The release notes will be further improved and
translated to additional languages in the weeks after the release.

Debian is a free operating system, developed by
thousands of volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the
Internet. The Debian project's key strengths are its volunteer base, its
dedication to the Debian Social Contract and Free Software, and its
commitment to provide the best operating system possible. This new
release is another important step in that direction.

"The project is still in a pre-alpha testing stage, but recently went public on the KDE website. Versions are available to download and try out."


KDE Linux is an entirely new and experimental OS. There's lots of room for confusion here, because KDE already has a demonstration distro, KDE Neon. KDE Linux is a totally separate and far more ambitious project. In terms of its underlying design, it's intended to be a super-stable end-user distro. This is in contrast with Neon, which is an experimental showcase for the latest and greatest code. Neon isn't meant to be anyone's daily driver... 

Several aspects of [KDE Linux's] design are clearly influenced by Valve's SteamOS 3. Like SteamOS 3, KDE Linux is an immutable distro, with dual read-only Btrfs-format root partitions that update each other alternately... KDE Linux isn't based on Ubuntu or Debian. It's built using Arch Linux, but it's different enough that it doesn't really count as an Arch variant. As an immutable distro, there's no package manager, for instance, so the user can't install Arch packages... You can only install sandboxed apps that go in their own corner of the OS, and here the plan is that users will install Flatpak (and possibly Snap, "if it's not too hard and the UX is OK") packages using the KDE Discover app store. Aside from them, you won't be able to update individual packages. OS updates come as a whole new system image, with all components updated at once.
 
"This is intended to one day be a bulletproof daily driver, not a demo system, which is the intended purpose of KDE Neon..." the article concludes. 

And while their test of current work-in-progress/test version kept crashing, "the promise is considerable, and this could turn out to be one of the most radical end-user distros out there."

The encryption algorithm used for the device they examined starts with a 128-bit key, but this gets compressed to 56 bits before it encrypts traffic, making it easier to crack. It’s not clear who is using this implementation of the end-to-end encryption algorithm, nor if anyone using devices with the end-to-end encryption is aware of the security vulnerability in them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the Nagasaki bombing went wrong</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nkiioPZL63U</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nkiioPZL63U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 9 Aug 2025 11:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#history #nagasakiday  #ww2 #vjday #historyfacts #militaryhistory]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline for AGI: 2030 with 50% chance</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mO3ay4F3S60</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mO3ay4F3S60?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 8 Aug 2025 23:23:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Story of Maya Lin | Full Documentary | POV | PBS (1994)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpdSPgdiO5o</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZpdSPgdiO5o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 8 Aug 2025 22:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a powerful exploration of art, politics and creativity, this Oscar-winning film highlights the story behind the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in DC, one of the era’s most controversial monuments.

That one-line requirement, albeit simple, would need multiple things to work in tandem to make it happen.What does a mainstream LLM (Large Language Model) chat app like ChatGPT or Claude provide at a high level?Ability to use chat with a cloud hosted LLM,Ability to run code generated by them mostly on their cloud infra, sometimes locally via shell,Ability to access the internet for new content or services.With so many LLMs being open source / open weights, shouldn't it be possible to do all that locally? But just local LLM is not enough, we need a truely isolated environment to run code as well.So, LLM for chat, Docker to containerize code execution, and finally a browser access of some sort for content.We wanted a system where:LLMs run completely Code executes inside a lightweight VM, not on the host machineBonus:  for automation and internet accessThe idea was to perform tasks which require privacy to be executed completely locally, starting from planning via LLM to code execution inside a container. For instance, if you wanted to edit your photos or videos, how could you do it without giving your data to OpenAI/Google/Anthropic? Though they take security seriously (more than many), it's just a matter of one slip leading to your private data being compromised, a case in point being the early days of ChatGPT when user chats were accessible from another's account!💡 We ran this entirely on Apple Silicon, using  for isolation.🛠️  Our Attempt at a Mac AppWe started with zealous ambition: make it feel native. We tried using , hoping it could help generate a Mac app. But it appears to be meant more for iOS app development — and getting it to work for MacOS was painful, to say the least.Even with help from the "world's best" LLMs, things didn't go quite as smoothly as we had expected. They hallucinated steps, missed platform-specific quirks, and often left us worse off.Then we tried wrapping a  app inside Electron. It took us longer than we'd like to admit. As of this writing, it looks like there's just no (clean) way to do it.So, we gave up on the Mac app. The local web version of  was good enough — simple, configurable, and didn't fight back.We thought  provided multiple LLM support out-of-the-box, as their landing page shows a drop-down of models. But, no.
So, we had to look for examples on how to go about it, and  appeared to be the popular choice.
Finally we had a dropdown for model selection. We decided not to restrict the set to just local models, as smaller local models are not quite there just yet. Users can get familiar with the tool and its capabilities, and later as small local models become better, they can just switch to being completely local.
Our use-case also required us to have models that support tool-calling. While some models do, Ollama has not implemented the tool support for them. For instance:responseBody: '{"error":"registry.ollama.ai/library/deepseek-r1:8b does not support tools"}',
And to add to the confusion, Ollama has decided to put this model under tool calling category on their site. Understandably, with the fast-moving AI landscape, it can be difficult for community driven projects to keep up.At the moment, essential information like whether a model has tool-support or not, pricing per token, for various models are so fickle. A model's official page mentions tool-support but then tools like Ollama take a while to implement them. Anyway, we shouldn't complain - it's open source, we could've contributed.After the UI was MVP-level sorted, we moved on to the isolated VM part. Recently Apple released a tool called 'Container'. Yes, that's right. So, we checked it out and it seemed better than Docker as it provided one isolated VM per container - a perfect fit for running AI generated code.
So, we deployed a Jupyter server in the VM, exposed it as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool, and made it available at http://coderunner.local:8222/mcp.The advantage of MCPing vs a exposing an API is that existing tools that work with MCPs can use this right away. For instance, Claude Desktop and Gemini CLI can start executing AI-generated code with a simple config."mcpServers": {
    "coderunner": {
      "httpUrl": "http://coderunner.local:8222/mcp"
    }
}
As you can see below, Claude figured out it should use the tool  exposed from our isolated VM via the MCP endpoint.

Aside - if you want to just use the  bit as an MCP to execute code with your existing tools, the code for  is public.A tangent - if you're planning to work with Apple  and building VM images using it, have an abundance of patience. The build keeps failing with  error or just hangs without any output. To continue, you should  all container processes and restart the  tool. Then remove the  image so that the next  process fetches a fresh one.
And repeat the three steps till it successfully works; this can take hours. We are excited to see Apple container mature as it moves beyond its early stages.Back to our app, we tested the  on a task to  and it worked!After the coderunner was verified to be working, we decided to add the support of a headless browser. The main reason was to allow the app to look for new/updated tools/information online, for example, browsing github to find installation instruction for some tool it doesn't yet know about. Another reason was laying the foundation for .
We chose Playwright for the task. We deployed it in the same container and exposed it as an MCP tool. Here is one task we asked it to do -With this our basic set up was ready: Local LLM + Sandboxed arbitrary code execution + Headless browser for latest information.What It Can Do (Examples)Generate and render charts from CSV using plain English (via ) — e.g., “cut between 0:10 and 1:00” — resize, crop, convert formatsInstall tools from GitHub in a containerized space to fetch pages and summarize content etc.We mapped a volume from
 (host)
to
 (container)So files edited/generated stay in a safe shared space, but code never touches the host system.Currently only works on Apple Silicon (macOS 26 is optional)Needs better UI for managing tools and output streamingHeadless browser is classified as bot by various sitesThis is more than a just an experiment. It's a philosophy shift bringing compute and agency back to your machine. No cloud dependency. No privacy tradeoffs. While the best models will probably be always with the giants, we hope that we will still have local tools which can get our day-to-day work done with the privacy we deserve.We didn't just imagine it. We built it. And now, you can use it too.Check out  on Github to get started, and let us know what you think. We welcome feedback, issues and contributions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kaizen!

Historian Luke Tomes is on a mission to find out, boarding a 17th Century replica Spanish Galleon to learn more about the world of trade in which piracy was born and what conditions were like for sailors at the time. 

Luke then is given behind-the-scenes access to the National Maritime Museum's new exhibition on Piracy, seeing some of the most priceless artefacts relating to the Golden Age, including one of the first editions of 'A General History of Pyrates', published in 1724 and written by Captain Charles Johnson. In it we see some of the first depictions of the most notorious pirates in history, like Blackbeard, Bartholomew Roberts, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. 

Finally, Luke travels to AC Sporting Targets in North London, where he meets up with John Hargreaves to test some of the weapons that would have been used by and against pirates during a raid at sea.

DESCRIPTION
Holly Cummins talks with Ben Evans about his latest book "Optimizing Cloud Native Java", which updates his previous work "Optimizing Java" to reflect the realities of cloud native environments.

Ben explains that performance engineering is not just technical but also psychological, emphasizing the importance of user expectations and defining clear performance goals. They discuss how modern Java performance must account for cloud native architectures, with applications running across distributed microservices and containerized, single-core environments.

The book focuses on the importance of measuring relevant data, warns against relying on misleading micro-benchmarks, and highlights how system-level benchmarks offer a clearer picture. Ben also delves into the JVM's hidden complexities, such as changes in Java 17 and the impact of virtual threads. Practical, real-world examples in the book, like the "fighting animals" microservices application, help developers learn how to optimize Java performance in real network environments.

Finally, Ben touches on the future of Java concurrency, with virtual threads and structured concurrency offering new ways to handle performance challenges in cloud native systems.

In the summer of 1963, a gang of masked robbers executed a daring plan to intercept a Royal Mail train carrying millions of pounds in cash. But the robbery itself was just the beginning - what came after - the most wanted men on the run, the jailbreak, the betrayals, fake identities, the surreptitious flights to Latin America and the manhunt across continents - the audacity of it all captured the public's imagination for decades.Joining Dan is the author of 'The Great Train Robbery: Crime of the Century', Nick Russell-Pavier, who recounts the story of the robbery itself, as well as Colin Mackenzie, who secured one of the scoops of the century when he tracked down train robber Ronnie Biggs in Brazil.Produced by Mariana Des Forges, edited and sound designed by Dougal Patmore.Join Dan and the team for a special LIVE recording of Dan Snow's History Hit on Friday, 12th September 2025!

The means: an attacker pretending to be someone in the customer's IT department feigning some sort of problem that required immediate access to the account. Two months later, Google has disclosed that it, too, was a victim.The series of hacks are being carried out by financially motivated threat actors out to steal data in hopes of selling it back to the targets at sky-high prices. Rather than exploiting software or website vulnerabilities, they take a much simpler approach: calling the target and asking for access. The technique has proven remarkably successful. Companies whose Salesforce instances have been breached in the campaign, Bleeping Computer reported, include Adidas, Qantas, Allianz Life, Cisco, and the LVMH subsidiaries Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany & Co.The attackers abuse a Salesforce feature that allows customers to link their accounts to third-party apps that integrate data with in-house systems for blogging, mapping tools, and similar resources. The attackers in the campaign contact employees and instruct them to connect an external app to their Salesforce instance. As the employee complies, the attackers ask the employee for an eight-digit security code that the Salesforce interface requires before a connection is made. The attackers then use this number to gain access to the instance and all data stored in it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing Headlamp AI Assistant</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/08/07/introducing-headlamp-ai-assistant/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Thu, 7 Aug 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Dev - Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This announcement originally appeared on the Headlamp blog.To simplify Kubernetes management and troubleshooting, we're thrilled to
introduce Headlamp AI Assistant: a powerful new plugin for Headlamp that helps
you understand and operate your Kubernetes clusters and applications with
greater clarity and ease.Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just getting started, the AI Assistant offers: Ask questions like "Is my application healthy?" or
 without needing deep Kubernetes knowledge. Start with high-level queries and dig deeper with prompts
like "List all the problematic pods" or "How can I fix this pod?" Ask questions in the context of what you're viewing
in the UI, such as  Let the AI take action for you, like "Restart that
deployment", with your permission.Here is a demo of the AI Assistant in action as it helps troubleshoot an
application running with issues in a Kubernetes cluster:Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed not just how we access data but
also how we interact with it. The rise of tools like ChatGPT opened a world of
possibilities, inspiring a wave of new applications. Asking questions or giving
commands in natural language is intuitive, especially for users who aren't deeply
technical. Now everyone can quickly ask how to do X or Y, without feeling awkward
or having to traverse pages and pages of documentation like before.Therefore, Headlamp AI Assistant brings a conversational UI to Headlamp,
powered by LLMs that Headlamp users can configure with their own API keys.
It is available as a Headlamp plugin, making it easy to integrate into your
existing setup. Users can enable it by installing the plugin and configuring
it with their own LLM API keys, giving them control over which model powers
the assistant. Once enabled, the assistant becomes part of the Headlamp UI,
ready to respond to contextual queries and perform actions directly from the
interface.As expected, the AI Assistant is focused on helping users with Kubernetes
concepts. Yet, while there is a lot of value in responding to Kubernetes
related questions from Headlamp's UI, we believe that the great benefit of such
an integration is when it can use the context of what the user is experiencing
in an application. So, the Headlamp AI Assistant knows what you're currently
viewing in Headlamp, and this makes the interaction feel more like working
with a human assistant.For example, if a pod is failing, users can simply ask 
and the AI Assistant will respond with the root cause, like a missing
environment variable or a typo in the image name. Follow-up prompts like
 allow the AI Assistant to suggest a fix, streamlining
what used to take multiple steps into a quick, conversational flow.Sharing the context from Headlamp is not a trivial task though, so it's
something we will keep working on perfecting.Context from the UI is helpful, but sometimes additional capabilities are
needed. If the user is viewing the pod list and wants to identify problematic
deployments, switching views should not be necessary. To address this, the AI
Assistant includes support for a Kubernetes tool. This allows asking questions
like "Get me all deployments with problems" prompting the assistant to fetch
and display relevant data from the current cluster. Likewise, if the user
requests an action like "Restart that deployment" after the AI points out what
deployment needs restarting, it can also do that. In case of "write"
operations, the AI Assistant does check with the user for permission to run them.Although the initial version of the AI Assistant is already useful for
Kubernetes users, future iterations will expand its capabilities. Currently,
the assistant supports only the Kubernetes tool, but further integration with
Headlamp plugins is underway. Similarly, we could get richer insights for
GitOps via the Flux plugin, monitoring through Prometheus, package management
with Helm, and more.And of course, as the popularity of MCP grows, we are looking into how to
integrate it as well, for a more plug-and-play fashion.We hope this first version of the AI Assistant helps users manage Kubernetes
clusters more effectively and assist newcomers in navigating the learning
curve. We invite you to try out this early version and give us your feedback.
The AI Assistant plugin can be installed from Headlamp's Plugin Catalog in the
desktop version, or by using the container image when deploying Headlamp.
Stay tuned for the future versions of the Headlamp AI Assistant!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI launches GPT-5 free to all ChatGPT users</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/08/openai-launches-gpt-5-free-to-all-chatgpt-users/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/openai_iceblue_hero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 7 Aug 2025 17:48:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, OpenAI announced GPT-5 and three variants—GPT-5 Pro, GPT-5 mini, and GPT-5 nano—what the company calls its "best AI system yet," with availability for some of the models across all ChatGPT tiers, including free users. The new model family arrives with claims of reduced confabulations, improved coding capabilities, and a new approach to handling sensitive requests that OpenAI calls "safe completions."It's also the first time OpenAI has given free users access to a simulated reasoning AI model, which breaks problems down into multiple steps using a technique that tends to improve answer accuracy for logical or analytical questions.GPT-5 represents OpenAI's latest attempt to unify its various AI capabilities into a single system. The company says the GPT-5 family acts as a "unified system" with a smart, efficient model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model called "GPT-5 thinking" for harder problems, and a real-time router that decides which approach to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and user intent.

--

In order to reattach a severed limb after an accident, a number of things need to go right— and quickly. A clean cut, properly preserving the limb, and getting it to a skilled surgeon in time are just a few of these challenges. And unfortunately, there are countless complications that come up with most accidental amputations. So, when is limb reattachment possible? Jason Hoellwarth investigates.

Their developers are saving 2+ hours per week thanks to Copilot.3 hrs per week due to slow builds4 hrs per week on dev environment toil2 hrs per week waiting for code reviewsAI is not a silver bullet. found it useful to get an AI assistant to write its own coding rules by analyzing his code, and then asking it to refine them as worked with it.the central paradox of using AI assistants effectively: to offload cognitive work to an AI, you must first do the meta-cognitive work of codifying your own development philosophy and collaboration style.I agree with   that there is a valuable distinction between disposable versus durable code, and that makes a difference in how we use AI with it.The difference between disposable code and durable code is not about whether the code was generated by AI or written by a human, or even how difficult it was to write. The cost is defined by the standards you are building to, and the rest of the software development lifecycle: how well you expect to maintain it, extend it, migrate it, understand its behavior, or fix it when it breaks. This is the expensive part of software development, the type that requires deep expertise and familiarity with your language and environment. Disposable code is cheap because you don’t even try to maintain it.It’s not fake intelligence, or artificial empathy, or HAL 9000 with manners. It’s something else. Something that thinks differently, not defectively.Event Sourcing provides perfect episodic memory by storing the complete history of domain changes as immutable events. Every decision, every state transition, every business event is preserved with full context.Repository patterns offer domain-focused memory interfaces that understand business concepts. A CustomerRepository knows how to retrieve customer information in ways that preserve business meaning, not just raw data.Bounded contexts from Domain-Driven Design partition memory into semantic boundaries, preventing the concept pollution that plagues pure vector-based approaches.Aggregates function as cohesive memory clusters with consistency boundaries—exactly what we need for reliable agent behavior.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Actions to improve impact intelligence</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/impact-intel.html#ActionsToImproveImpactIntelligence</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 7 Aug 2025 13:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Dev - Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ continues his article on impact

Python added support for TOML in Python 3.11 with its  module in the standard library. However, unlike some of Python’s other standard libraries, such as or its XML-related libraries, the  library is only for reading, not writing. To create TOML documents in Python, you will need a third-party TOML package, such as tomlkit or toml.Many Python developers use TOML as their configuration format of choice. In fact, you will find that most popular Python packages use a file called  for configuration. You can even use that file as a replacement for  Mypy, Flake8, and other tools can also be configured using  You can learn more about that file and how it is formatted in the Python packaging guide.In this tutorial, you will focus only on what Python itself provides for TOML support.Python’s  is based on the tomli package. You can read all about the implementation details and why TOML support was added to Python in PEP 680.The nice thing about having TOML support built-in to Python is that you do not need to install anything other than Python itself. However, if you need to be able to create or edit a TOML document, then you will need a third-party package as  is read-only.To really understand what happens when you use the  module, you need a TOML file. You can pick your favorite Python package and grab a TOML file from it. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can use the Squall package’s TOML file. Squall is a TUI for viewing and editing SQLite databases.Here’s what the TOML looks like:[project]
name = "squall_sql"
dynamic = [
    "version",
]
description = "Squall - SQLite Editor"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
authors = [
    { name = "Mike Driscoll", email = "mike@nlah.org" },
]
maintainers = [
    { name = "Mike Driscoll", email = "mike@nlah.org" },
]

keywords = [
    "tui",
    "sql",
    "sqlite",
    "terminal",
]
dependencies = [
    "rich>=13.9.4",
    "SQLAlchemy>=2.0.38",
    "textual>=2.1.1",
]
packages = [
    "src/squall",
]

file = "LICENSE"

Issues = "https://github.com/driscollis/squall/issues"
Discussions = "https://github.com/driscollis/squall/discussions"
Wiki = "https://github.com/driscollis/squall/wiki"

[project.scripts]
squall = "squall.squall:main"

[build-system]
requires = [
    "hatchling",
    "wheel",
]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[dependency-groups]

path = "src/squall/__init__.py"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = [
    "src/squall",
]
include = [
    "py.typed",
    "**/*.py",
    "**/*.html",
    "**/*.gif",
    "**/*.jpg",
    "**/*.png",
    "**/*.md",
    "**/*.tcss",
]

    "*.pyc",
    "__pycache__",
    "*.so",
    "*.dylib",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = [
  "src"
]The next step is to write some Python code to attempt to read in the TOML file above. Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a file. You can call it something like if you want.Then enter the following code into it:import tomllib

from pathlib import Path
from pprint import pprint


pyproject = Path("pyproject.toml")

with pyproject.open("rb") as config:
    data = tomllib.load(config)

pprint(data)Here you open the TOML file from Squall and load it using the  module. You use Python’s module to print it out. The nice thing about the module is that it returns a dictionary.Of course, the dictionary doesn’t print nicely without using pretty print, which is why you use the module here.The following is the output you will get if you run this code:{'build-system': {'build-backend': 'hatchling.build',
                  'requires': ['hatchling', 'wheel']},
 'dependency-groups': {'dev': ['build>=1.2.1',

You can now read a TOML file with Python and you get a nicely formatted dictionary!The TOML format is great and well established, especially in the Python world. If you ever plan to create a package of your own, you will probably need to create a TOML file. If you work in dev/ops or as a system administrator, you may need to configure tools for CI/CD in the pyproject.toml file for Mypy, Flake8, Ruff, or some other tool.Knowing how to read, write and edit a TOML file is a good tool to have in your kit. Check out Python’s  module for reading or if you need more power, check out tomlkit or toml.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Some Principles From Real World Internal Developer Platform Engineering • Russ Miles • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTSu0clAP-c</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mTSu0clAP-c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 7 Aug 2025 12:01:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOcph

ABSTRACT
Principles are tools that provide touchstones to help you navigate a blurry reality. When you’re faced with difficult choices it’s your principles, aligned with your values, that steer your course away from or into the rocks. You can’t anticipate the seas you’re going to sail, but good principles will work regardless of how choppy the waters are. And the broad and deep waters of building a successful internal developer platform can be choppier than most, so holding your principles close is essential to not drowning in all that platform engineering promise.

Platform engineering promises the best application of people, financial and technical resources to support and deliver speed at scale, so the stakes are high and the promise mouth-watering to unsuspecting CTOs. But there’s “many a slip-twixt-cup-and-lip”, and it’s looking likely that the roads in the coming years will be likely peppered with wasted budgets and articles such as “Why platform engineering doesn’t work”. So let’s get ahead of all that negativity and talk about how it can work in a couple of real-world environments.

In this talk Russ Miles, Technical Product Owner of the Cloud and On-Premise Infrastructure Platform Products at Clear.Bank, will share some principles he uses to guide the teams responsible for delivering a successful internal developer platform. Using real-world examples and stories, and being very careful of survivor bias, we’ll explore the complex terrain that a platform initiative has to plot a course through. After this talk you’ll take away a toolbox of principles to apply to your own complex, socio-technical working environment. You’ll learn the foundations and principles that can keep your own platform engineering initiatives off the rocks and sailing in the blue waters of ROI.

How you may ask?
It all starts by not feeding the pigeons. Curious? See you at the talk! [...]

While the 2002 original could have easily been written off as another Grand Theft Auto clone, Mafia and subsequent titles in the franchise carved a niche for themselves by being narrative-driven experiences built around a specific time and place. Empire Bay from Mafia 1 and 2 is an amalgamation of Chicago and New York created to capture the feeling of 1930s and 50s gangster culture, while New Bordeaux from Mafia 3 attempted to depict the Vietnam-era in the south. Mafia: The Old Country successfully continues this trend with its depiction of Sicily in the early 1900s, but is ultimately held back by its shallow mechanics and dated design.Mafia: The Old Country follows Enzo Favara as he falls in with the Torrisi Crime Family. After fleeing the sulfur mines, Enzo is saved by Don Torrisi, a soft-spoken and enigmatic mob boss that sounds like another  soft-spoken crime lord. Torrisi sees potential in Enzo and puts him to work at his vineyard where he meets Luca, a mentor-like figure to Enzo; Cesare, Don Torrisi’s hot-headed nephew; and Isabella, the Don’s daughter with whom Enzo has an instant connection. Throughout the course of the 12-hour story, Enzo sinks deeper and deeper into the criminal underworld. It’s a fairly predictable mobster story that’s elevated by strong characters, great performances, and thoughtful writing.That said, Mafia: The Old Country’s cast doesn’t make the best first impression. Enzo is very quiet and standoffish in the early hours; Don Torissi, at times, sounds a little  like Michael Corleone; and Luca--despite being one of my favorite characters by the end--comes across as just another rank-and-file mobster. Fortunately, after the first couple of chapters, their personalities start to come through more strongly. This is especially true for Luca, who helps guide Enzo through his new life within the Torrisi family. Meanwhile, Cesare develops beyond a simple hothead as he struggles to live up to his uncle’s lofty expectations. The only exception to the slow burn of character personalities is Tino, Don Torrisi consigliere. Portrayed by Anthony Skordi, Tino makes a chilling impression out of the gate and frequently steals whatever scene he’s in.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Does HTTPS Work 🔥</title><link>https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/how-does-https-work</link><author>Neo Kim</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6c94ae9-610c-45c0-845b-781f15c15243_1280x720.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 7 Aug 2025 11:46:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/">Dev - System Design Newsletter</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get my system design playbook for FREE on newsletter signup:This post outlines how HTTPS works. You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, the internet was a quiet place with only a tiny number of servers.And the users communicated with servers by sending and receiving files.They shared files through File Transfer Protocol (), email attachments, and floppy disks.Yet it became difficult to transfer information in a simple and standardized way.So they created the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).Think of  as a set of rules for transferring information on the Internet.Although it temporarily solved the data transfer problem, there were new issues.HTTP sends data in plaintext without encryption.It means someone on the public network can easily access or change the information.HTTP doesn’t support a mechanism to check if the server is the right one.It means someone else could pretend to be the server and steal the user's data.So it became difficult to transfer sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. is the only AI coding agent built for real engineering teams.It understands your codebase—across 10M+ lines, 10k+ files, and every repo in your stack—so it can actually help: writing functions, fixing CI issues, triaging incidents, and reviewing PRs.All from your IDE or terminal. No vibes. Just progress.They wanted a secure version of HTTP.So they created Hypertext Transfer Protocol Security (HTTPS).Imagine  as HTTP running over an extra protocol to keep information secure.The extra protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS). Think of  as a mechanism to encrypt data sent between the client and server.TLS creates a secure connection using a process called the . It's used to establish an HTTPS connection when a user visits a site.The browser sends a message to the server.It includes the list of supported cryptographic algorithms, TLS versions. And also a randomly generated string called .The server then responds with its TLS certificate and supported cryptographic algorithm. Besides it includes a randomly generated string called .Yet it’s important to confirm the server identity for authenticity. So the browser verifies the received TLS certificate with the certificate authority. Imagine the  as a trusted organization that verifies server identity.But both client and server must have the same key to encrypt session data efficiently.So the browser sends a temporary key () to the server. While it’s encrypted using the server’s public key, which was taken from the TLS certificate.Yet only the private key can decrypt the data that was encrypted using a public key. So the server decrypts the received pre-master secret using its . Thus making this data transfer secure.Think of the  as an email address; anybody can send messages to it. While the  is like the inbox password, only the user with the password can read emails.Both browser and server use the pre-master secret, server random, and client random to compute the  session key.Think of the  as a symmetric cryptographic key that can encrypt and decrypt data. It’s valid either for a set period or for as long as communication is ongoing.All future communication then gets encrypted using the session key. It means nobody can see the messages on the public network.Yet it’s necessary to check if the TLS handshake was successful.So the browser sends a finished message, which is encrypted using the session key. The server then responds with a finished message, encrypted using the session key.This marks the completion of a TLS handshake.Put simply, the TLS certificate handles authentication, while the TLS protocol handles encryption.Thus providing authenticity, confidentiality, and integrity in data transfer.HTTP is rarely used on public networks now.Yet it's still in use on internal networks and legacy systems where data sensitivity is low. Because it offers convenience with simplicity.While HTTPS has become the fundamental communication protocol of the internet.And search engines like Google give preference to HTTPS-enabled sites in their search results. Besides HTTPS is necessary for compliance in transferring sensitive information: financial data.But there’s an overhead with the setup and maintenance of a TLS certificate. Also HTTPS can be slightly slower than HTTP because of encryption overhead. Yet HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offset this overhead with better performance.So always use HTTPS on public sites because of its security and trust advantages.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox: delivers bite-sized deep dives on emerging devtools, career growth, and smart bets for builders.Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.

Pompeii: The New Dig
The series follows the biggest archaeological excavation in Pompeii for a generation. Exciting discoveries and fresco-inspired animations tell the story of life in Pompeii AD 79. It also imagines the horrors faced by resident as Vesuvius erupted. Stream now: https://to.pbs.org/3ysvubQ

The excavation aims to unearth the buildings, their purpose, who lived there, and what happened to them during the eruption. Alongside the present tense story of the dig, the series investigates the timeline of the eruption. From the violent earthquakes that shook the city in the years before the eruption to the day of the disaster, Vesuvius first slowly buries Pompeii and then delivers the killer blows in the form of pyroclastic flows.

And, for the first time, pioneering new research finds hard evidence that some Pompeiians escaped the city and survived the eruption. From evidence hidden in Pompeii’s storeroom of prominent Pompeiians, the investigation discovers inscriptions that date from after the eruption and bear the same name in the area surrounding the destroyed city.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hunter Biden on the Illuminati and Diddy Parties</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/j5rGRdb_dho</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/j5rGRdb_dho?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 6 Aug 2025 20:54:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE from Denver with Nora Jones!

Infinite adventures. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds returns July 17, only on Paramount+.

What will Rubin Observatory discover that no one’s expecting? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice learn and answer cosmic queries about the Vera Rubin Observatory, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and our next big tool to uncover more about the universe with Zeljko Ivezic, Director of Rubin Observatory Construction. 

What happens when you aim the world’s largest digital camera at the night sky for 10 years? Learn about the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and how the Rubin Observatory will upend our relationship to the night sky. Learn how the telescope will detect gravitational lensing, supernovae, large structures, and asteroids and could answer cosmic mysteries like dark matter, dark energy, and even Einstein’s equations. 

Could the Rubin  Observatory prove Einstein’s theory of gravity wrong? Could it help find Planet Nine or even discover something we don’t yet know to look for?

From telescope construction challenges to AI-powered discovery and the future of citizen science, explore how Rubin works and how it will change how we see the universe. Plus, what happens if a star explodes when no one’s watching? And why Chuck really doesn’t want to drive the truck carrying the 8-meter mirror.

DESCRIPTION
Sarah Wells and Anne Currie dive into “The Cloud Native Attitude” and uncover why it’s more than just using cloud infrastructure. It’s about breaking bottlenecks, embracing rapid change, and aligning the entire organization.

Anne reflects on how Kubernetes has risen since the book’s first edition, but the core principles remain. They discuss why CI/CD is key, how cloud native supports sustainability, and why true transformation demands more than just a lift-and-shift. The conversation wraps up with practical advice on identifying real bottlenecks and securing buy-in for a successful cloud native journey.

Every few years, someone declares the end of moviegoing. First it was cable, then VHS, then DVDs, streaming, and even COVID. And yet — the big screen persists.

Sure, the landscape has changed. Since 2019, the U.S. has lost nearly 5,000 movie theater screens. Big chains have struggled financially. Alamo Drafthouse, once independent, was recently acquired by Sony Pictures. And Netflix’s Ted Sarandos famously claimed that moviegoing is an “outdated concept.”

But people still love going to the movies — and independent movie theater owners are meeting that passion head-on.

Across the country, independent cinemas are reimagining what it means to be a theater. From inventive programming and community events to affordable tickets and local partnerships, they’re creating experiences that go far beyond just watching a film.

We sat down with Emelyn Stuart (Stuart Cinema), Matthew Viragh (Nitehawk Cinemas), and Thaddeus Bouchard (Screendollars) to explore how these theaters are thriving — and why the industry isn’t on life support just yet.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, there was a tiny startup. They offered live-streaming services.Yet they had only a few customers.So they deployed code overnight with a scheduled downtime. means releasing new code to users.But one day, a celebrity joined their platform for a livestream.Because of this, their platform became popular among users around the world.Although explosive growth is a good problem to have, deploying new code without downtime became difficult.Also they were on a tight budget.They used the  deployment pattern to keep things simple.Put another way, they take the system offline for a short period. And replace the old version with the newer version on each server.So the service remains unavailable during deployment. Besides any failure with the new version affected all users at once.Until one day, when their lead engineer decided to evaluate different deployment patterns to solve this problem.One of the biggest IT giants, TCS, laid off 12,000 people this week. And this is just the beginning of the bloodbath.In the coming days, you’ll see not thousands, but millions more layoffs & displacement of jobs. So what should you do right now to avoid getting affected?Invest your time in learning about AI: the tools, the use cases, the workflows–as much as you can.Date: 9 August (Saturday) and 10 August (Sunday), 10 AM - 7 PM, EST time zone.Rated 4.9/5 by global learners–this will truly make you an AI Generalist that can build, solve & work on anything with AI.In just 16 hours & 5 sessions, you will:✅ Learn how AI really works by learning 10+ AI tools, LLM models, and their practical use cases.✅ Learn to build and ship products faster, in days instead of months✅  that handle your repetitive work and free up 20+ hours weekly✅ Create professional images and videos for your business, social media, and marketing campaigns.✅ Turn these AI skills into $10k income by consulting or starting your own AI services business.All by global experts from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, SamurAI, and more. And it’s all for free. 🤯 🚀The rolling release offers zero-downtime deployment.Some servers get taken offline and updatedThose updated servers then go onlineThis process repeats until all servers get the new versionPut simply, a new version is rolled out server by server until it’s fully deployed.While the system remains available because the remaining servers handle requests during deployment. For example, Twitter and Etsy use this pattern for routine feature deployment with minimal user impact.Only a subset of servers runs the code initially. Because of that, the failure impact is low during deployment. Yet it’s infrastructure-driven and doesn’t focus on specific user segments. Also the rollout is relatively slow as updating each server takes time.So use this pattern only if you need zero downtime and to avoid extra infrastructure costs.Ready for the next technique?The blue-green pattern offers zero-downtime deployment and instant rollback.Set up 2 identical environments called Blue & GreenThe new version gets tested on GreenWhile Blue runs the old version and handles requests to avoid downtimeThe entire traffic then gets routed to Green using a load balancer or DNSAlso Blue acts as a fallback until the new version on Green becomes stable. Because of that, an instant rollback is possible. Besides testing the new version in a production-like environment (Green) increases release confidence.For example, Netflix uses this pattern for critical services to avoid service interruption.Yet running 2 environments in parallel increases infrastructure costs and complexity. Also there’s an extra operational overhead.So use this pattern only for critical services and high-risk deployments.The name comes from the use of the canary bird in coal mines to detect toxic gases quickly.A tiny percentage of users get the new versionWhile the remaining traffic goes to the old versionThe traffic to the new version then gets slowly increased (10% → 50% → 100%)Put another way, real-world users validate the new version before rolling it out entirely. Thus increasing the release confidence.Also a failure in the new version affects only some users, and a quick rollback is possible. For example, Amazon uses this pattern to fix problems before a global rollout.Yet it increases the complexity with advanced monitoring and automated rollout control. Besides setting up routing rules needs extra effort.So use this pattern for large-scale services and high-risk deployments. Or when a beta launch to a subset of users is necessary.This pattern allows for code deployment without directly releasing it to users.A  means conditional logic in the code.The developer puts the new feature behind a feature toggleAnd the feature remains hidden until someone turns on the toggleOne can turn a feature toggle on or off for specific users via a configuration dashboardThus separating code deployment from feature release.For example, Google and Facebook use feature toggles for A/B testing and safe releases.This pattern makes it easy to enable or disable features for a specific set of users. Also it enables continuous integration by deploying code safely behind feature toggles.Yet the code complexity increases because of conditional paths. Also testing becomes hard because one should test both on and off states. Besides feature toggles can become a technical debt if unremoved on time.So use this pattern when you need frequent deployments without affecting users. Or when you need to do an A/B test or a beta launch.Each deployment pattern solves a specific problem.But there’s no silver bullet.So choose the right pattern based on your needs: safety, speed, and cost.While most companies use different deployment patterns within the same project. For example, a payment service might use blue-green for zero downtime. While frontend UI might use canary or feature flags for safe releases.Ever since that day, our tiny startup installed a combination of deployment patterns and lived happily ever after.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Everything you need to know to land your next Data Science job.

Atomic People
In August 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. 118,000 people died immediately; by the end of the year, that number would rise to 210,000 across both cities. 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the moments when those bombs changed millions of lives across multiple generations — and survivors still feel the impacts.

In “Atomic People” on PBS, you’ll get a first-hand look at what it felt like to be in Japan on those fateful days. You’ll hear about the fear, suffering and health effects of the atomic bombs, but also the resilience and survival that defined a nation. These are the stories of the Hibakusha — people impacted by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The smell of vibe coding (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/155</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/155/changelog-news-155.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 4 Aug 2025 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Alex Kondov knows when you’ve been vibe coding.

The Great Storm of 1703 was one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. A night of terror that cost the lives of over 1000 sailors and thirteen of the Royal Navy’s most valuable ships.

Tearing across the English Channel, swallowing ships, shattering cities, and claiming thousands of lives. Amongst the storm's casualties was Northumberland, one of the Royal Navy's most formidable warships, sunk with all hands.

Lost to the sea for over three hundred years. Shifting sands have started to reveal the broken vessel, once the pride of Her Majesty’s Fleet. But now, exposed to the elements, archaeologists are racing against time to save as much of the ship as possible before it’s gone forever.

Thanks to our partners at Historic England for granting us permission to film on the wreck site and The Historic Dockyard Chatham and Royal Maritime Museum for their support and participation.

In this video, we examine the implications of Trump’s latest trade deals —from the one-sided EU deal to politically charged moves against Brazil. Are the deals being structured to exclude China from global supply chains and are these tariffs just about trade, or something more? We explore how constant changes are disrupting business activity, whether manufacturing is really coming back to the U.S., and what history tells us about protectionism’s impact on innovation and productivity.

But somewhere along the way, it became a tool for surveillance, extraction, and control. What happened? And is there still time to reclaim the weird, untapped potential of the digital world?

This week, Sean is joined by Douglas Rushkoff. He’s a media theorist, author of Survival of the Richest and Team Human, and host of the Team Human podcast. They trace the arc of the internet from its utopian beginnings to its corporate capture, and explore what it would take to build something different. Along the way, they talk about the loss of weirdness, the logic of capitalism, the dangers of scale, and the difference between systems thinking and systems feeling. They also reflect on whether it’s still possible to use technology to foster a more connected and communal life.

And yesterday 2025's International Obfuscated C Code Contest concluded — with 23 new winners announced in a special four-and-a-half-hour livestreamed ceremony! 
Programmers submitted their funniest programs showcasing C's unusual/obscure subtleties while having some fun. (And demonstrating the importance of clarity and style by setting some very bad examples...) Among this year's winners were an OpenRISC 32-bit CPU emulator, a virtual machine capable of running Doom, and some kind of salmon recipe that makes clever use of C's U"string" literal prefix... 

But yes, every entry's source code is ridiculously obfuscated. ("Before you set off on your adventure to decode this program's logic, make sure you have enough food, ammo, clothes, oxen, and programming supplies," read the judge's remarks on the winner of this year's "diabolical logistics" prize. "You'll be driving for 2170 miles through a wild wilderness inspired by Oregon Trail...") And one entrant also struggled mightily in adapting a rough port of their program's old Atari 2600 version, but was never gonna give it up... 


Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader achowe for bringing the news (who has submitted winning entries in four different decades, starting in 1991 and continuing through 2024)... 
Including a 2004 award for the best abuse of the contest's guidelines. ("We are not exactly sure how many organisations will be upset with this entry, but we are considering starting an IOCCC standards body just to reign in the likes of Mr Howe....")]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Toughest Programming Question for High School Students on This Year&apos;s CS Exam: Arrays</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/08/03/0351204/the-toughest-programming-question-for-high-school-students-on-this-years-cs-exam-arrays?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 3 Aug 2025 18:38:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[America's nonprofit College Board lets high school students take college-level classes — including a computer programming course that culminates with a 90-minute test. But students did better on questions about If-Then statements than they did on questions about arrays, according to the head of the program. Long-time Slashdot reader theodp explains:
Students exhibited "strong performance on primitive types, Boolean expressions, and If statements; 44% of students earned 7-8 of these 8 points," says program head Trevor Packard. But students were challenged by "questions on Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D Arrays; 17% of students earned 11-12 of these 12 points." 

"The most challenging AP Computer Science A free-response question was #4, the 2D array number puzzle; 19% of students earned 8-9 of the 9 points possible." 
You can see that question here. ("You will write the constructor and one method of the SumOrSameGame class... Array elements are initialized with random integers between 1 and 9, inclusive, each with an equal chance of being assigned to each element of puzzle...") Although to be fair, it was the last question on the test — appearing on page 16 — so maybe some students just didn't get to it. 

theodp shares a sample Java solution and one in Excel VBA solution (which includes a visual presentation). 

There's tests in 38 subjects — but CS and Statistics are the subjects where the highest number of students earned the test's lowest-possible score (1 out of 5). That end of the graph also includes notoriously difficult subjects like Latin, Japanese Language, and Physics. 

There's also a table showing scores for the last 23 years, with fewer than 67% of students achieving a passing grade (3+) for the first 11 years. But in 2013 and 2017, more than 67% of students achieved that passsing grade, and the percentage has stayed above that line ever since (except for 2021), vascillating between 67% and 70.4%. 

2018: 67.8%
2019: 69.6%
2020: 70.4%
2021: 65.1%
2022: 67.6%
2023: 68.0%
2024: 67.2%

Pompeii: The New Dig
The series follows the biggest archaeological excavation in Pompeii for a generation. Exciting discoveries and fresco-inspired animations tell the story of life in Pompeii AD 79. It also imagines the horrors faced by resident as Vesuvius erupted. Stream now: https://to.pbs.org/3ysvubQ

The excavation aims to unearth the buildings, their purpose, who lived there, and what happened to them during the eruption. Alongside the present tense story of the dig, the series investigates the timeline of the eruption. From the violent earthquakes that shook the city in the years before the eruption to the day of the disaster, Vesuvius first slowly buries Pompeii and then delivers the killer blows in the form of pyroclastic flows.

And, for the first time, pioneering new research finds hard evidence that some Pompeiians escaped the city and survived the eruption. From evidence hidden in Pompeii’s storeroom of prominent Pompeiians, the investigation discovers inscriptions that date from after the eruption and bear the same name in the area surrounding the destroyed city.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5 Million People Tried Microsoft&apos;s AI Coding Tool &apos;GitHub Copilot&apos; in the Last 3 Months</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/08/03/037202/5-million-people-tried-microsofts-ai-coding-tool-github-copilot-in-the-last-3-months?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 3 Aug 2025 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft's AI coding assistant "GitHub Copilot" has now had 20 million "all-time users," a GitHub spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Microsoft and GitHub don't report how many of these 20 million people have continued to use the AI coding tool on a monthly or daily basis — though those metrics are likely far lower. 
Microsoft also reported that GitHub Copilot, which is among the most popular AI coding tools offered today, is used by 90% of the Fortune 100. The product's growth among enterprise customers has also grown about 75% compared to last quarter, according to the company... In 2024, Nadella said GitHub Copilot was a larger business than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018.

Fiverr just released an ad mocking vibe coding. 
The video features what its description calls a "clueless entrepreneur" building an app to tell if an avocado is ripe — who soon ends up blissfully singing with an avocado to the tune of the cheesy 1987 song "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now." The avocado sings joyously of "a new app on the rise in a no-code world that's too good to be true" (rhyming that with "So close. Just not tested through...") 

"Let them say we're crazy. I don't care about bugs!" the entrepreneur sings back. "Built you in a minute, now I'm so high off this buzz..." 

But despite her singing to the overripe avocado that "I don't need a backend if I've got the spark!" and that they can "build this app together, vibe-coding forever. Nothing's going to stop us now!" — the build suddenly fails. (And it turns out that avocado really was overripe...) Fiverr then suggests viewers instead hire one of their experts for building their apps... 

The art/design site Creative Bloq acknowledges Fiverr "flip-flopping between scepticism and pro-AI marketing." (They point out a Fiverr ad last November had ended with the tagline "Nobody cares that you use AI! They care about the results — for the best ones higher Fiverr experts who've mastered every digital skill including AI.") But the site calls this new ad "a step in the right direction towards mindful AI usage."

Just like an avocado that looks perfect on the outside, once you inspect the insides, AI-generated code can be deceptively unripe. 

Fiverr might be feeling the impact of vibecoding themselves. The freelancing web site saw the company's share price fall over 14% this week, with one Yahoo! Finance site saying this week's quarterly results revealed Fiverr's active buyers dropped 10.9% compared to last year — a decrease of 3.4 million buyers which "overshadowed a 9.8% increase in spending per buyer."
 

Even when issuing a buy recommendation, Seeking Alpha called it "a short-term rebound play, as the company faces longer-term risks from AI and active buyer churn."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Steam on Linux Market Share Stats &apos;Likely the Largest Surveyed Figure Ever&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/08/02/0551235/new-steam-on-linux-market-share-stats-likely-the-largest-surveyed-figure-ever?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 2 Aug 2025 17:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["The July 2025 results of the Steam Survey were posted a few minutes ago," Phoronix reported last night, "and show a healthy 0.32% increase to put the Linux gaming marketshare at 2.89%."

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary O’Reilly explore how we evolved to be different from eachother, what's up with Neanderthal DNA, and humanity's superpower with Herman Pontzer, evolutionary anthropologist and author of Adaptable: How Your Unique Body Works and Why Biology Unites Us.

Is there such a thing as a textbook average human? Herman explains how biological diversity is not a dividing factor but an expression of our shared humanity. Are skin color and race scientifically meaningful? Why are we all “shape-shifters” biologically? Explore why cultural and biological inheritance together make us uniquely versatile in the animal kingdom, and where our individual differences come from. How many of them are adaptations versus random noise? 

Learn how body shapes adapted to latitude, why high-altitude populations thrive where others struggle, and how Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA shaped modern humans. Did the gene that helps Himalayan people come from an extinct hominin?

The team examines whether modern life mismatches our evolutionary design. From heart disease to sedentary lifestyles, what do ancient bodies face in modern cities? Discover why natural selection needs individual mutation to work and how genetic diversity is what gives humanity our superpower.

Get it here: https://iqunix.com/products/iqunix-ez80-magnetic-switch-hall-effect-gaming-keyboard
Erratum: part of the message at 8:05 got clipped; that scene should start off with "The keyboard allows you to switch to different performance profiles; by default there's custom, office and e-sports..."
The guy from Iqunix did get back to me and confirmed that the keycaps are indeed ABS, with UV printing. The software also indeed doesn't allow you to make macros yet, this is still in development (but planned). 
Today we look at a keyboard that takes the Hall effect to another level; the Iqunix EZ80 keyboard. This comes with a whole bunch of electronics and special switches that supposedly offer better performance than other Hall effect keyboards - quite a claim. Hope you enjoy the video!

OpenAI was informed that its access was cut off due to violating the terms of service. "Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI's own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5," Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty said in a statement to WIRED. "Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service." According to Anthropic's commercial terms of service, customers are barred from using the service to "build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models" or "reverse engineer or duplicate" the services. This change in OpenAI's access to Claude comes as the ChatGPT-maker is reportedly preparing to release a new AI model, GPT-5, which is rumored to be better at coding.
 
OpenAI was plugging Claude into its own internal tools using special developer access (APIs), instead of using the regular chat interface, according to sources. This allowed the company to run tests to evaluate Claude's capabilities in things like coding and creative writing against its own AI models, and check how Claude responded to safety-related prompts involving categories like CSAM, self-harm, and defamation, the sources say. The results help OpenAI compare its own models' behavior under similar conditions and make adjustments as needed. "It's industry standard to evaluate other AI systems to benchmark progress and improve safety. While we respect Anthropic's decision to cut off our API access, it's disappointing considering our API remains available to them," OpenAI's chief communications officer Hannah Wong said in a statement to WIRED. Nulty says that Anthropic will "continue to ensure OpenAI has API access for the purposes of benchmarking and safety evaluations as is standard practice across the industry."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE 🔴 Exploring The Extreme Weather Of Our Universe | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aucJqouDs4A</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aucJqouDs4A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 1 Aug 2025 23:31:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Take a journey through space and discover the beautiful and terrifying weather our universe holds.

When Meta recently offered AI researcher Matt Deitke $250 million over four years (an average of $62.5 million per year)—with potentially $100 million in the first year alone—it shattered every historical precedent for scientific and technical compensation we can find on record. That includes salaries during the development of major scientific milestones of the 20th century.The New York Times reported that Deitke had cofounded a startup called Vercept and previously led the development of Molmo, a multimodal AI system, at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. His expertise in systems that juggle images, sounds, and text—exactly the kind of technology Meta wants to build—made him a prime target for recruitment. But he's not alone: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly also offered an unnamed AI engineer $1 billion in compensation to be paid out over several years. What's going on?These astronomical sums reflect what tech companies believe is at stake: a race to create artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence—machines capable of performing intellectual tasks at or beyond the human level. Meta, Google, OpenAI, and others are betting that whoever achieves this breakthrough first could dominate markets worth trillions. Whether this vision is realistic or merely Silicon Valley hype, it's driving compensation to unprecedented levels.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SO much to dig into (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/104</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/104/changelog--friends-104.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 1 Aug 2025 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adam & Jerod (plus zero other randos) dig into Stack Overflow’s 2025 developer survey results.

Crafted by Blasphemous developer The Game Kitchen, Ragebound is a deliberately old-school action game that captures the essence of the classic Ninja Gaiden series, with sharp gameplay, challenging levels, and gloriously retro visuals and music that would feel right at home on the Super NES. It also builds upon this foundation with some smart new mechanics, making it more than a mere imitation of earlier games.Rather than putting you in control of series mainstay Ryu, Ragebound follows two new protagonists: Kenji Mozu, an untested trainee of the Hayabusa Clan; and Kumori, a mysterious kunoichi from the rival Black Spider Clan. When Kenji steps in to save Hayabusa Village from a sudden demon onslaught, the pair's destinies become entwined and they form an uneasy alliance, using their combined abilities to stand against the demonic forces threatening the world.Like so many other aspects of the game, Ragebound's plot is pure Ninja Gaiden: scattershot, nonsensical, and ultimately inconsequential. In their quest to stop the Demon Lord from being unleashed, Kenji and Kumori travel to various sites throughout Japan, battling grotesque monsters, commandeering the occasional vehicle, and eventually becoming entangled in the CIA's affairs. It's knowingly silly stuff, and it affords the developers plenty of opportunities to whisk players through a range of memorable set pieces, from ancient Japanese villages and castles to busy construction sites, flooded pirate coves, and secret military facilities.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2359 - Mike Maxwell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajMlhHjt3gk</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ajMlhHjt3gk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 1 Aug 2025 17:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mike Maxwell is an artist whose work explores many themes, including humanity, consciousness, and the unknown.

It leverages ISPs in that country, which are obligated to work on behalf of the Russian government. With the ability to control the ISP network, the threat group—which Microsoft tracks under the name Secret Blizzard—positions itself between a targeted embassy and the end points they connect to, a form of attack known as an adversary in the middle, or AitM. The position allows Secret Blizzard to send targets to malicious websites that appear to be known and trusted.Objective: Install ApolloShadow“While we previously assessed with low confidence that the actor conducts cyberespionage activities within Russian borders against foreign and domestic entities, this is the first time we can confirm that they have the capability to do so at the Internet Service Provider (ISP) level,” members of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team wrote. “This means that diplomatic personnel using local ISP or telecommunications services in Russia are highly likely targets of Secret Blizzard’s AiTM position within those services.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jack Weatherford: Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire | Lex Fridman Podcast #476</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1H1Ob7jk8Q</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/U1H1Ob7jk8Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 21:10:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jack Weatherford is an anthropologist and historian specializing in Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire.

It is still very much a video game driven by rewarding puzzle mechanics, but the meat of the experience is the insight it gives of what it can feel like to be an actor. It's altogether more disturbing than spooky, and although certain supernatural elements do dampen the puzzle box nature and horror of the overall game, Dead Take is still a powerful, emotion-driven descent into one man's psyche.Experienced entirely in first-person, Dead Take has you play as an actor named Chase who breaks into and explores the seemingly abandoned mansion of Cain, a famous Hollywood producer. There are signs of a party, but all the lights are off and an eerie stillness hangs over the darkened hallways and strangely shaped rooms. Chase is looking for his friend, Vinny, another actor, who successfully landed the role of Willie in an upcoming movie--a role that Chase had also been gunning for. As you guide Chase through the mansion, you'll slowly uncover what transpired behind the scenes during the movie's pre-production, learning how so many people's lives were destroyed in service to the damaged and traumatized ego of one man.It's a haunting tale brought to life by full-motion video (FMV) recordings of powerhouse actors in the industry. Neil Newbon gives Chase an almost psychopathic desperation to his need to land the role of Willie, while Ben Starr hides Vinny's nepotism behind charismatic suave and charm to produce a completely different type of creepiness. The unnerving and disgusting battle behind the scenes to determine the leading lady opposite Willie and cover up a "problematic" woman for a more "agreeable" one is explored through the fantastic (and subsequently, deeply uncomfortable to watch) performances of Alanah Pearce and Laura Bailey. And at one point, Jane Perry delivers a performance of Cain's wife so powerful and deeply chilling, I doubt I'll ever forget it.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why The Multiverse Could Be Real</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX1EfW3euY4</link><author>PBS Space Time</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HX1EfW3euY4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 20:15:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to Displate for sponsoring the video.

The multiverse pops out of quite a few theories in physics, and has been proposed as a solution to certain vexing problems. But it’s also been argued that the very idea of a multiverse is just bad science. That it’s unfalsifiable and a dead-end to inquiry and as bad a violation of Occam’s razor as you could imagine. But the multiverse might also exist. Can something that exists be bad science?

Grounded went 1.0 in 2022 and enjoyed many updates both before and after that milestone. Because of the sequel's changes to some of the game's foundational elements, I won't be at all surprised if Grounded 2 is eventually a much better game. Some of those changes already make it difficult to return to the first game. However, the sequel is also without some of the original's essential features for now, too, meaning this game about shrunken heroes needs more time to grow bigger and better than the original.Grounded 2 wastes no time getting its band of adolescent heroes shrunk back down to the size of insects, opening with a hurried, "Oops, I did it again" kind of story beat. Max, Willow, Hoops, and Pete are slightly older and a little more vulgar in their teen years, but once more find themselves fighting to survive in the wilderness of a world where bugs don't just sting or bite; they aim to kill.Though Grounded 2 does occasionally play like a horror game, such as when you're traveling at night without a torch and the glowing eyes of a scorpion or wolf spider suddenly stalk your path ahead, its best trait is one it naturally carries over from the first game: its childlike spirit. Whereas so many survival-crafting games are bleak, sometimes grueling affairs telling thematically dark tales with muted color palettes, Grounded's world is vibrant and silly, colorful and whimsical, and that's a difference I truly adore. The sun-soaked Brookhaven Park gives you a whole new world to explore, decorated with a familiar sense of exploration.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2358 - Chadd Wright</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpM-pGPb8kc</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xpM-pGPb8kc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:01:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chadd Wright is a retired Navy SEAL, endurance athlete, speaker, and entrepreneur.

--

The gods watched as Oedipus’ daughter, Antigone, stole out of the palace in Thebes the morning after a devastating battle. Antigone was on a dangerous mission to do what she felt was right, though it meant risking her life. She sought to abide by divine law and honor her late brother Polyneices through burial— but the king had other plans. Stephen Esposito shares the tragic Greek tale of Antigone.

The 2025 survey exposes a widening gap between AI adoption and satisfaction: while 84% of developers now use or plan to use AI tools, their trust has cratered. 

Only 33% trust AI accuracy today, down from 43% last year. The core problem isn't broken code that developers can easily spot and discard. Instead, two-thirds report wrestling with AI solutions that appear correct but contain subtle errors requiring significant debugging time.

The technique, known as a Linux bind mount, is used in IT administration but had never been seen used by threat actors. The trick allowed the malware to operate similarly to a rootkit, which uses advanced techniques to hide itself from the operating system it runs on.End goal: Backdooring the ATM switching networkThe Raspberry Pi was connected to the same network switch used by the bank’s ATM system, a position that effectively put it inside the bank’s internal network. The goal was to compromise the ATM switching server and use that control to manipulate the bank’s hardware security module, a tamper-resistant physical device used to store secrets such as credentials and digital signatures and run encryption and decryption functions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>So far, only one-third of Americans have ever used AI for work</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/07/so-far-only-one-third-of-americans-have-ever-used-ai-for-work/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/robot_puzzle_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 18:47:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, The Associated Press released results from a new AP-NORC poll showing that 60 percent of US adults have used AI to search for information, while only 37 percent of all Americans have used AI for work tasks.

I recently thought it would be fun to port that code to Textual so I could have an XML viewer and editor in my terminal as well.In this article, you will learn how that experiment went and see the results. Here is a quick outline of what you will cover:Get the packages you will needCreating the edit XML screenAdding an XML preview screenCreating file browser and warning screensCreating the file save screenYou will need Textual to be able to run the application detailed in this tutorial. You will also need lxml, which is a super fast XML parsing package. You can install Textual using pip or uv. You can probably use uv with lxml as well, but pip definitely works.Here’s an example using pip to install both packages:python -m pip install textual lxmlOnce pip has finished installing Textual and the lxml package and all its dependencies, you will be ready to continue!The first step in creating the user interface is figuring out what it should look like. Here is the original Boomslang user interface that was created using wxPython:You want to create something similar to this UI, but in your terminal. Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called  and then enter the following code into it:from pathlib import Path

    def on_recent_files_selected(self, event: OptionList.OptionSelected) -> None:
        self.current_recent_file = Path(event.option.prompt)

    def update_recent_files_ui(self) -> None:
        if self.recent_files_path.exists():
            self.recent_files.clear_options()
            files = self.recent_files_path.read_text()
            for file in files.split("\n"):

def main() -> None:
    app = BoomslangXML()
    app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()That’s a good chunk of code, but it’s still less than a hundred lines. You will go over it in smaller chunks though. You can start with this first chunk:from pathlib import Path

from .edit_xml_screen import EditXMLScreen
from .file_browser_screen import FileBrowser

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical
from textual.widgets import Button, Header, Footer, OptionList


class BoomslangXML(App):
    BINDINGS = [
        ("ctrl+o", "open", "Open XML File"),
    ]
    CSS_PATH = "main.tcss"

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.title = "Boomslang XML"
        self.recent_files_path = Path(__file__).absolute().parent / "recent_files.txt"
        self.app_selected_file: Path | None = None
        self.current_recent_file: Path | None = NoneYou need a few imports to make your code work. The first import comes from Python itself and gives your code the ability to work with file paths. The next two are for a couple of small custom files you will create later on. The rest of the imports are from Textual and provide everything you need to make a nice little Textual application.Next, you create the  class where you set up a keyboard binding and set which CSS file you will be using for styling your application.The  method sets the following:The title of the applicationThe recent files path, which contains all the files you have recently openedThe currently selected file or NoneThe current recent file (i.e. the one you have open at the moment) or NoneNow you are ready to create the main UI:def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
    self.recent_files = OptionList("", id="recent_files")
    self.recent_files.border_title = "Recent Files"
    yield Header()
    yield self.recent_files
    yield Vertical(
            Horizontal(
                Button("Open XML File", id="open_xml_file", variant="primary"),
                Button("Open Recent", id="open_recent_file", variant="warning"),
                id="button_row",
            )
        )
    yield Footer()To create your user interface, you need a small number of widgets:A header to identify the name of the applicationAn OptionList which contains the recently opened files, if any, that the user can reloadA button to load a new XML fileA button to load from the selected recent fileA footer to show the application’s keyboard shortcutsNext, you will write a few event handlers:def on_mount(self) -> None:
    self.update_recent_files_ui()

def action_open(self) -> None:
    self.push_screen(FileBrowser())

def on_file_browser_selected(self, message: FileBrowser.Selected) -> None:
    path = message.path
    if path.suffix.lower() == ".xml":
        self.update_recent_files_on_disk(path)
        self.push_screen(EditXMLScreen(path))
    else:
        self.notify("Please choose an XML File!", severity="error", title="Error")
The code above contains the logic for three event handlers:– After the application loads, it will update the OptionList by reading the text file that contains paths to the recent files.– A keyboard shortcut action that gets called when the user presses CTRL+O. It will then show a file browser to the user so they can pick an XML file to load.on_file_browser_selected()– Called when the user picks an XML file from the file browser and closes the file browser. If the file is an XML file, you will reload the screen to allow XML editing. Otherwise, you will notify the user to choose an XML file.The next chunk of code is for three more event handlers:@on(Button.Pressed, "#open_xml_file")
def on_open_xml_file(self) -> None:
    self.push_screen(FileBrowser())

@on(Button.Pressed, "#open_recent_file")
def on_open_recent_file(self) -> None:
    if self.current_recent_file is not None and self.current_recent_file.exists():
        self.push_screen(EditXMLScreen(self.current_recent_file))

@on(OptionList.OptionSelected, "#recent_files")
def on_recent_files_selected(self, event: OptionList.OptionSelected) -> None:
    self.current_recent_file = Path(event.option.prompt)
These event handlers use Textual’s handy decorator, which allows you to bind the event to a specific widget or widgets.– If the user presses the “Open XML File” button, this method is called and it will show the file browser.– If the user presses the “Open Recent” button, this method gets called and will load the selected recent file.on_recent_files_selected()– When the user selects a recent file in the OptionList widget, this method gets called and sets the variable.You only have two more methods to go over. The first is for updating the recent files UI:def update_recent_files_ui(self) -> None:
    if self.recent_files_path.exists():
        self.recent_files.clear_options()
        files = self.recent_files_path.read_text()
        for file in files.split("\n"):
            self.recent_files.add_option(file.strip())
Remember, this method gets called by and it will update the OptionList, if the file exists. The first thing this code will do is clear the OptionList in preparation for updating it. Then you will read the text from the file and loop over each path in that file.As you loop over the paths, you add them to the OptionList. That’s it! You now have a recent files list that the user can choose from.The last method to write is for updating the recent files text file:def update_recent_files_on_disk(self, path: Path) -> None:
    if path.exists() and self.recent_files_path.exists():
        recent_files = self.recent_files_path.read_text()
        if str(path) in recent_files:
            return

        with open(self.recent_files_path, mode="a") as f:
            f.write(str(path) + "\n")

        self.update_recent_files_ui()
    elif not self.recent_files_path.exists():
        with open(self.recent_files_path, mode="a") as f:
            f.write(str(path) + "\n")
When the user opens a new XML file, you want to add that file to the recent file list on disk so that the next time the user opens your application, you can show the user the recent files. This is a nice way to make loading previous files much easier.The code above will verify that the file still exists and that your recent files file also exists. Assuming that they do, you will check to see if the current XML file is already in the recent files file. If it is, you don’t want to add it again, so you return.Otherwise, you open the recent files file in append mode, add the new file to disk and update the UI.If the recent files file does not exist, you create it here and add the new path.Here are the last few lines of code to add:def main() -> None:
    app = BoomslangXML()
    app.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()Now you’re ready you move on and add some CSS styling to your UI.Your XML editor doesn’t require extensive styling. In fact, there is nothing wrong with being minimalistic.Open up your favorite IDE or text editor and create a new file named and then add the following code:BoomslangXML {
    #button_row {
        align: center middle;
    }

    Horizontal{
        height: auto;
    }

    OptionList {
        border: solid green;
    }

    Button {
        margin: 1;
    }
}Here you center the button row on your screen. You also set the container’s height to auto, which tells Textual to make the container fit its contents. You also add a border to your and a margin to your buttons.The XML editor screen is fairly complex, so that’s what you will learn about next.Creating the Edit XML ScreenThe XML editor screen is more complex than the main screen of your application and contains almost twice as many lines of code. But that’s to be expected when you realize that most of your logic will reside here.As before, you will start out by writing the full code and then going over it piece-by-piece. Open up your Python IDE and create a new file named and then enter the following code:import lxml.etree as ET

Most applications take thousands of lines of code.Just the same, breaking the code down into smaller chunks will aid in your understanding of what’s going on.With that in mind, here’s the first chunk:import lxml.etree as ET
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

from .add_node_screen import AddNodeScreen
from .preview_xml_screen import PreviewXMLScreen

from textual import on
from textual.app import ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical, VerticalScroll
from textual.screen import ModalScreen
from textual.widgets import Footer, Header, Input, Tree
from textual.widgets._tree import TreeNodeYou have move imports here than you did in the main UI file. Here’s a brief overview:You import lxml to make parsing and editing XML easy.You use Python’s module to create a temporary file for viewing the XML.The module is used the same way as before.You have a couple of custom Textual screens that you will need to code up and import.The last six lines are all Textual imports for making this editor screen work.The next step is to subclass the widget in such a way that it will store XML element data:class DataInput(Input):
    """
    Create a variant of the Input widget that stores data
    """

    def __init__(self, xml_obj: ET.Element, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.xml_obj = xml_objHere you pass in an XML object and store it off in an instance variable. You will need this to make editing and displaying the XML easy.The second class you create is the :class EditXMLScreen(ModalScreen):
    BINDINGS = [
        ("ctrl+s", "save", "Save"),
        ("ctrl+a", "add_node", "Add Node"),
        ("p", "preview", "Preview"),
        ("escape", "esc", "Exit dialog"),
    ]
    CSS_PATH = "edit_xml_screens.tcss"

    def __init__(self, xml_path: Path, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.xml_tree = ET.parse(xml_path)
        self.expanded = {}
        self.selected_tree_node: None | TreeNode = NoneThe is a new screen that holds your XML editor. Here you add four keyboard bindings, a CSS file path and the method.Your initialization method is used to create an lxml Element Tree instance. You also create an empty dictionary of expanded tree widgets and the selected tree node instance variable, which is set to .Now you’re ready to create your user interface:def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
    xml_root = self.xml_tree.getroot()
    self.expanded[id(xml_root)] = ""
    yield Header()
    yield Horizontal(
        Vertical(Tree("No Data Loaded", id="xml_tree"), id="left_pane"),
        VerticalScroll(id="right_pane"),
        id="main_ui_container",
    )
    yield Footer()

def on_mount(self) -> None:
    self.load_tree()
Fortunately, the user interface needed for editing XML is fairly straightforward:You create a new header to add a new title to the screen.You use a horizontally-oriented container to hold your widgets.
Inside of the container, you have a tree control that holds the DOM of the XML on the left.On the right, you have a vertical scrolling container.Finally, you have a footerYou also set up the first item in your “expanded” dictionary, which is the root node from the XML.Now you can write your first event handler for this class:@on(Tree.NodeExpanded)
def on_tree_node_expanded(self, event: Tree.NodeExpanded) -> None:
    """
    When a tree node is expanded, parse the newly shown leaves and make
    them expandable, if necessary.
    """
    xml_obj = event.node.data
    if id(xml_obj) not in self.expanded and xml_obj is not None:
        for top_level_item in xml_obj.getchildren():
            child = event.node.add_leaf(top_level_item.tag, data=top_level_item)
            if top_level_item.getchildren():
                child.allow_expand = True
            else:
                child.allow_expand = False
        self.expanded[id(xml_obj)] = ""
When the user expands a node in the tree control, the method will get called. You will extract the node’s data, if it has any. Assuming that there is data, you will then loop over any child nodes that are present.For each child node, you will add a new leaf to the tree control. You check to see if the child has children too and set the flag accordingly. At the end of the code, you add then XML object to your dictionary.The next method you need to write is an event handler for when a tree node is selected:@on(Tree.NodeSelected)
def on_tree_node_selected(self, event: Tree.NodeSelected) -> None:
    """
    When a node in the tree control is selected, update the right pane to show
    the data in the XML, if any
    """
    xml_obj = event.node.data
    right_pane = self.query_one("#right_pane", VerticalScroll)
    right_pane.remove_children()
    self.selected_tree_node = event.node

    if xml_obj is not None:
        for child in xml_obj.getchildren():
            if child.getchildren():
                continue
            text = child.text if child.text else ""
            data_input = DataInput(child, text)
            data_input.border_title = child.tag
            container = Horizontal(data_input)
            right_pane.mount(container)
        else:
            # XML object has no children, so just show the tag and text
            if getattr(xml_obj, "tag") and getattr(xml_obj, "text"):
                if xml_obj.getchildren() == []:
                    data_input = DataInput(xml_obj, xml_obj.text)
                    data_input.border_title = xml_obj.tag
                    container = Horizontal(data_input)
                    right_pane.mount(container)
Wben the user selects a node in your tree, you need to update the righthand pane with the node’s contents. To do that, you once again extract the node’s data, if it has any. If it does have data, you loop over its children and update the right hand pane’s UI. This entails grabbing the XML node’s tags and values and adding a series of horizontal widgets to the scrollable container that makes up the right pane of your UI.If the XML object has no children, you can simply show the top level node’s tag and value, if it has any.The next two methods you will write are as follows:@on(Input.Changed)
def on_input_changed(self, event: Input.Changed) -> None:
    """
    When an XML element changes, update the XML object
    """
    xml_obj = event.input.xml_obj
    xml_obj.text = event.input.value

def on_save_file_dialog_dismissed(self, xml_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Save the file to the selected location
    """
    if not Path(xml_path).exists():
        self.xml_tree.write(xml_path)
        self.notify(f"Saved to: {xml_path}")

The  method deals with widgets which are your special widgets. Whenever they are edited, you want to grab the XML object from the event and update the XML tag’s value accordingly. That way, the XML will always be up-to-date if the user decides they want to save it.You can also add an auto-save feature which would also use the latest XML object when it is saving, if you wanted to.The second method here, on_save_file_dialog_dismissed(), is called when the user dismisses the save dialog that is opened when the user presses . Here you check to see if the file already exists. If not, you create it. You could spend some time adding another dialog here that warns that a file exists and gives the option to the user whether or not to overwrite it.Anyway, your next step is to write the keyboard shortcut action methods. There are four keyboard shortcuts that you need to create actions for.def action_esc(self) -> None:
    """
    Close the dialog when the user presses ESC
    """
    self.dismiss()

def action_add_node(self) -> None:
    """
    Add another node to the XML tree and the UI
    """

    # Show dialog and use callback to update XML and UI
    def add_node(result: tuple[str, str] | None) -> None:
        if result is not None:
            node_name, node_value = result
            self.update_xml_tree(node_name, node_value)

    self.app.push_screen(AddNodeScreen(), add_node)

def action_preview(self) -> None:
    temp_directory = Path(tempfile.gettempdir())
    xml_path = temp_directory / "temp.xml"
    self.xml_tree.write(xml_path)
    self.app.push_screen(PreviewXMLScreen(xml_path))

def action_save(self) -> None:
    self.app.push_screen(SaveFileDialog(), self.on_save_file_dialog_dismissed)
The four keyboard shortcut event handlers are:– Called when the user pressed the “Esc” key. Exits the dialog.– Called when the user presses . Opens the . If the user adds new data, the callback is called, which will then call to update the UI with the new information.– Called when the user presses the “p” key. Creates a temporary file with the current contents of the XML object. Then opens a new screen that allows the user to view the XML as a kind of preview.– Called when the user presses .The next method you will need to write is called :def load_tree(self) -> None:
    """
    Load the XML tree UI with data parsed from the XML file
    """
    tree = self.query_one("#xml_tree", Tree)
    xml_root = self.xml_tree.getroot()
    self.expanded[id(xml_root)] = ""

    tree.reset(xml_root.tag)
    tree.root.expand()

    # If the root has children, add them
    if xml_root.getchildren():
        for top_level_item in xml_root.getchildren():
            child = tree.root.add(top_level_item.tag, data=top_level_item)
            if top_level_item.getchildren():
                child.allow_expand = True
            else:
                child.allow_expand = False
The method above will grab the widget and the XML’s root element and then load the tree widget with the data. You check if the XML root object has any children (which most do) and then loop over the children, adding them to the tree widget.You only have two more methods to write. Here they are:def update_tree_nodes(self, node_name: str, node: ET.SubElement) -> None:
    """
    When adding a new node, update the UI Tree element to reflect the new element added
    """
    child = self.selected_tree_node.add(node_name, data=node)
    child.allow_expand = False

def update_xml_tree(self, node_name: str, node_value: str) -> None:
    """
    When adding a new node, update the XML object with the new element
    """
    element = ET.SubElement(self.selected_tree_node.data, node_name)
    element.text = node_value
    self.update_tree_nodes(node_name, element)These two methods are short and sweet: – When the user adds a new node, you call this method which will update the node in the tree widget as needed. – When a node is added, update the XML object and then call the UI updater method above.The last piece of code you need to write is the CSS for this screen. Open up a text editor and create a new file called  and then add the following code:EditXMLScreen {
    Input {
        border: solid gold;
        margin: 1;
        height: auto;
    }
    Button {
        align: center middle;
    }
    Horizontal {
        margin: 1;
        height: auto;
    }
}This CSS is similar to the other CSS file. In this case, you set the  widget’s height to auto. You also set the margin and border for that widget. For the buttons, you tell Textual to center all of them. Finally, you also set the margin and height of the horizontal container, just like you did in the other CSS file.Now you are ready to learn about the add node screen!When the user wants to add a new node to the XML, you will show an “add node screen”. This screen allows the user to enter a node (i.e., tag) name and value. The screen will then pass that new data to the callback which will update the XML object and the user interface. You have already seen that code in the previous section.To get started, open up a new file named and enter the following code:from textual import on
from textual.app import ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical
from textual.screen import ModalScreen
from textual.widgets import Button, Header, Footer, Input


class AddNodeScreen(ModalScreen):
    BINDINGS = [
        ("escape", "esc", "Exit dialog"),
    ]
    CSS_PATH = "add_node_screen.tcss"

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.title = "Add New Node"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.node_name = Input(id="node_name")
        self.node_name.border_title = "Node Name"
        self.node_value = Input(id="node_value")
        self.node_value.border_title = "Node Value"

        yield Vertical(
            Header(),
            self.node_name,
            self.node_value,
            Horizontal(
                Button("Save Node", variant="primary", id="save_node"),
                Button("Cancel", variant="warning", id="cancel_node"),
            ),
            Footer(),
            id="add_node_screen_ui",
        )

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#save_node")
    def on_save(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss((self.node_name.value, self.node_value.value))

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#cancel_node")
    def on_cancel(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()

    def action_esc(self) -> None:
        """
        Close the dialog when the user presses ESC
        """
        self.dismiss()Following is an overview of each method of the code above:– Sets the title of the screen.– Creates the user interface, which is made up of two widgets, a “Save” button, and a “Cancel” button.-Called when the user presses the “Save” button. This will save the data entered by the user into the two inputs, if any.– Called when the user presses the “Cancel” button. If pressed, the screen exits without saving.– Called when the user presses the “Esc” key. If pressed, the screen exits without saving.That code is concise and straightforward.Next, open up a text editor or use your IDE to create a file named which will contain the following CSS:AddNodeScreen {
    align: center middle;
    background: $primary 30%;

    #add_node_screen_ui {
            width: 80%;
            height: 40%;
            border: thick $background 70%;
            content-align: center middle;
            margin: 2;
        }

    Input {
        border: solid gold;
        margin: 1;
        height: auto;
    }

    Button {
        margin: 1;
    }

    Horizontal{
        height: auto;
        align: center middle;
    }
}Your CSS functions as a way to quickly style individual widgets or groups of widgets. Here you set it up to make the screen a bit smaller than the screen underneath it (80% x 40%) so it looks like a dialog.You set the border, height, and margin on your inputs. You add a margin around your buttons to keep them slightly apart. Finally, you add a height and alignment to the container.You can try tweaking all of this to see how it changes the look and feel of the screen. It’s a fun way to explore, and you can do this with any of the screens you create.The next screen to create is the XML preview screen.Adding an XML Preview ScreenThe XML Preview screen allows the user to check that the XML looks correct before they save it. Textual makes creating a preview screen short and sweet.Open up your Python IDE and create a new file named and then enter the following code into it:from textual import on
from textual.app import ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Center, Vertical
from textual.screen import ModalScreen
from textual.widgets import Button, Header, TextArea


class PreviewXMLScreen(ModalScreen):
    CSS_PATH = "preview_xml_screen.tcss"

    def __init__(self, xml_file_path: str, *args: tuple, **kwargs: dict) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.xml_file_path = xml_file_path
        self.title = "Preview XML"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        with open(self.xml_file_path) as xml_file:
            xml = xml_file.read()
        text_area = TextArea(xml)
        text_area.language = "xml"
        yield Header()
        yield Vertical(
            text_area,
            Center(Button("Exit Preview", id="exit_preview", variant="primary")),
            id="exit_preview_ui",
        )

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#exit_preview")
    def on_exit_preview(self, event: Button.Pressed) -> None:
        self.dismiss()There’s not a lot here, so you will go over the highlights like you did in the previous section:– Initializes a couple of instance variables:
– Which is a temporary file path– The title of the screen– The UI is created here. You open the XML file and read it in. Then you load the XML into a widget. Finally, you tell Textual to use a header, the text area widget and an exit button for your interface.– Called when the user presses the “Exit Preview” button. As the name implies, this exits the screen.The last step is to apply a little CSS. Create a new file named and add the following snippet to it:PreviewXMLScreen {
    Button {
        margin: 1;
    }
}All this CSS does is add a margin to the button, which makes the UI look a little nicer.There are three more screens yet to write. The first couple of screens you will create are the file browser and warning screens.Creating the File Browser and Warning ScreensThe file browser is what the user will use to find an XML file that they want to open. It is also nice to have a screen you can use for warnings, so you will create that as well.For now, you will call this file but you are welcome to separate these two screens into different files. The first half of the file will contain the imports and the class.from pathlib import Path

from textual import on
from textual.app import ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Center, Grid, Vertical
from textual.message import Message
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button, DirectoryTree, Footer, Label, Header


class WarningScreen(Screen):
    """
    Creates a pop-up Screen that displays a warning message to the user
    """

    def __init__(self, warning_message: str) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.warning_message = warning_message

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        """
        Create the UI in the Warning Screen
        """
        yield Grid(
            Label(self.warning_message, id="warning_msg"),
            Button("OK", variant="primary", id="ok_warning"),
            id="warning_dialog",
        )

    def on_button_pressed(self, event: Button.Pressed) -> None:
        """
        Event handler for when the OK button - dismisses the screen
        """
       self.dismiss()
       event.stop()

The warning screen is made up of two widgets: a label that contains the warning message and an “OK” button. You also add a method to respond to the buton being pressed. You dismiss the screen here and stop the event from propagating up to the parent.The next class you need to add to this file is the class:class FileBrowser(Screen):
    BINDINGS = [
        ("escape", "esc", "Exit dialog"),
    ]

    CSS_PATH = "file_browser_screen.tcss"

    class Selected(Message):
        """
        File selected message
        """

        def __init__(self, path: Path) -> None:
            self.path = path
            super().__init__()

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.selected_file = Path("")
        self.title = "Load XML Files"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Vertical(
            Header(),
            DirectoryTree("/"),
            Center(
                Button("Load File", variant="primary", id="load_file"),
            ),
            id="file_browser_dialog",
        )

    @on(DirectoryTree.FileSelected)
    def on_file_selected(self, event: DirectoryTree.FileSelected) -> None:
        """
        Called when the FileSelected Message is emitted from the DirectoryTree
        """
        self.selected_file = event.path

    def on_button_pressed(self, event: Button.Pressed) -> None:
        """
        Event handler for when the load file button is pressed
        """
        event.stop()

        if self.selected_file.suffix.lower() != ".xml" and self.selected_file.is_file():
            self.app.push_screen(WarningScreen("ERROR: You must choose a XML file!"))
            return

        self.post_message(self.Selected(self.selected_file))
        self.dismiss()

    def action_esc(self) -> None:
        """
        Close the dialog when the user presses ESC
        """
        self.dismiss()The class is more complicated because it does a lot more than the warning screen does. Here’s a listing of the methods:– Initializes the currently selected file to an empty path and sets the title for the screen.– Creates the UI. This UI has a header, a for browsing files and a button for loading the currently selected file.– When the user selected a file in the directory tree, you grab the path and set the instance variable.– When the user presses the “Load File” button, you check if the selected file is the correct file type. If not, you should a warning screen. If the file is an XML file, then you post a custom message and close the screen.– Called when the user presses the key. Closes the screen.The last item to write is your CSS file. As you might expect, you should name it . Then put the following CSS inside of the file:FileBrowser {
    #file_browser_dialog {
            width: 80%;
            height: 50%;
            border: thick $background 70%;
            content-align: center middle;
            margin: 2;
            border: solid green;
        }
    Button {
        margin: 1;
        content-align: center middle;
    }
}The CSS code here should look pretty familiar to you. All you are doing is making the screen look like a dialog and then adding a margin and centering the button.The last step is to create the file save screen.Creating the File Save ScreenThe file save screen is similar to the file browser screen with the main difference being that you are supplying a new file name that you want to use to save your XML file to.Open your Python IDE and create a new file called and then enter the following code:from pathlib import Path

from textual import on
from textual.app import ComposeResult
from textual.containers import Vertical
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button, DirectoryTree, Footer, Header, Input, Label


class SaveFileDialog(Screen):
    CSS_PATH = "save_file_dialog.tcss"

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.title = "Save File"
        self.root = "/"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Vertical(
            Header(),
            Label(f"Folder name: {self.root}", id="folder"),
            DirectoryTree("/"),
            Input(placeholder="filename.txt", id="filename"),
            Button("Save File", variant="primary", id="save_file"),
            id="save_dialog",
        )

    def on_mount(self) -> None:
        """
        Focus the input widget so the user can name the file
        """
        self.query_one("#filename").focus()

    def on_button_pressed(self, event: Button.Pressed) -> None:
        """
        Event handler for when the load file button is pressed
        """
        event.stop()
        filename = self.query_one("#filename").value
        full_path = Path(self.root) / filename
        self.dismiss(f"{full_path}")

    @on(DirectoryTree.DirectorySelected)
    def on_directory_selection(self, event: DirectoryTree.DirectorySelected) -> None:
        """
        Called when the DirectorySelected message is emitted from the DirectoryTree
        """
        self.root = event.path
        self.query_one("#folder").update(f"Folder name: {event.path}")The save file dialog code is currently less than fifty lines of code. Here is a breakdown of that code:– Sets the title of the screen and the default root folder.– Creates the user interface, which consists of a header, a label (the root), the directory tree widget, an input for specifying the file name, and a “Save File” button.– Called automatically by Textual after the method. Sets the input widget as the focus.– Called when the user presses the “Save File” button. Grabs the filename and then create the full path using the root + filename. Finally, you send that full path back to the callback function via .– Called when the user selects a directory. Updates the variable to the selected path as well as updates the label so the user knows which path is selected.The last item you need to write is the CSS file for this dialog. You will need to name the file and then add this code:SaveFileDialog {
    #save_dialog {
            width: 80%;
            height: 50%;
            border: thick $background 70%;
            content-align: center middle;
            margin: 2;
            border: solid green;
        }
    Button {
        margin: 1;
        content-align: center middle;
    }
}The CSS code above is almost identical to the CSS you used for the file browser code.When you run the TUI, you should see something like the following demo GIF:You have now created a basic XML editor and viewer using Python and Textual. There are lots of little improvements that you can add to this code. However, those updates are up to you to make.Have fun working with Textual and create something new or contribute to a neat Textual project yourself!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What is GeoHashing?</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/geohashing</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d645062c-ae73-46ea-836e-1c60a4849471_2048x1365.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:21:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Dev - Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine you’re building a system like , , or a nearby restaurant finder.You need to store and query millions or even billions of location points to find what's "close" to a specific point? And you want to do it .But querying latitude and longitude ranges can get messy and slow, especially at scale.That’s where  comes in.In this article, we’ll explore:Limitations and trade-offsPractical System Design Example are critical but time-consuming.  acts as your AI co-pilot, providing instant Code review comments and potential impacts of every pull request.Beyond just flagging issues, CodeRabbit provides one-click fix suggestions and lets you define custom code quality rules using AST Grep patterns, catching subtle issues that traditional static analysis tools might miss. has so far reviewed more than , installed on , and used by 70 thousand Open-source projects. CodeRabbit is free for all open-source repo's.Imagine you have a database table of restaurants, with columns for  and . A user at (lat: 34.0523, lon: -118.2438) wants to find all restaurants within a 1km radius.How would you write this query?A naive approach might be a "bounding box" query:This works, but it has major performance problems at scale:Most databases use , which are fantastic for one-dimensional data. But they struggle with 2D queries. The database can use an index on latitude, but then it has to do a full scan of all matching rows to filter by longitude (or vice-versa). A  on (latitude, longitude) helps, but it still doesn't truly understand spatial locality.We need a way to represent 2D proximity in a 1D format that a standard database index can efficiently search. That’s what  is about. is a method of encoding geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) into a short alphanumeric string.It was invented by  as a way to enable efficient spatial indexing and proximity search in databases and distributed systems. The coordinates for downtown  can be encoded as the geohash: .This hash looks like just a random string of characters but it has two magical properties:The more characters two GeoHashes share at the beginning (i.e., the longer their common prefix), the closer those two locations are geographically.This means: will usually have .  will have completely different prefixes.GeoHashes are : each additional character in the hash zooms in to a more precise region. and  share the first  → they belong to  but are . and  share only the first  → they are , likely hundreds of kilometers. → starts with a completely different prefix. It represents a  region, possibly on another continent.2. One-Dimensional and IndexableGeoHashes convert 2D coordinates (latitude, longitude) into a . This string can be stored in a  or  field in a relational or NoSQL database, and indexed efficiently using a  or .Fast lookups of nearby placesEasy sharding based on locationEfficient sorting and filtering using standard indexesGeoHashing may look like magic at first glance, but it’s built on a simple and elegant idea: convert a 2D geographic point into a 1D string through binary encoding and interleaving.Let’s walk through the process of encoding a  pair into a GeoHash — step by step.Step 1: Define the Initial RangesWe begin by defining the global bounds of latitude and longitude: ranges from  ranges from These represent the full span of the Earth’s surface in both dimensions.The goal is to gradually  this range by encoding whether a coordinate lies in the  of the current interval, similar to a binary search.Step 2: Convert to Binary by InterleavingNow, we start converting the latitude and longitude into binary.We start with the full range of values:We then repeatedly divide each range in half and record a binary digit based on which half the coordinate falls into:If the value is in the , we append a .If the value is in the , we append a .This is a lot like binary search — but instead of just narrowing down to a value, we record each decision as a bit in the final output.Interleaving Latitude and Longitude BitsWe don’t encode latitude and longitude separately. We  their bits:4th bit → latitude... and so on.This interleaving produces a  that represents the position in a Morton curve (Z-order curve), which helps preserve spatial locality.Let’s walk through the first few steps for the point: (37.7749° N, -122.4194° W)Step 1: Longitude → -122.4194°Initial range: Midpoint =  → -122.4194 < 0 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → -122.4194 < -90 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → -122.4194 > -135 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → -122.4194 < -112.5 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → -122.4194 > -123.75 →  → New range: So first 5 longitude bits = Step 2: Latitude → 37.7749°Initial range: Midpoint =  → 37.7749 > 0 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → 37.7749 < 45 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → 37.7749 > 22.5 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → 37.7749 > 33.75 →  → New range: Midpoint =  → 37.7749 < 39.375 →  → New range: First 5 latitude bits = Step 3: Interleave the BitsInterleaving the two binary sequences:Longitude bits:  0 0 1 0 1  
Latitude bits:   1 0 1 1 0  

Interleaved:     0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0Resulting binary string (10 bits): Step 4: Continue Until You Reach Desired PrecisionYou typically continue this process until you have: → 6-character GeoHash → 7-character GeoHash → very high precisionStep 3: Convert Binary to Base32 StringOnce we’ve built a long binary string by interleaving latitude and longitude bits, we need to compress it into something shorter and human-readable.This is where  comes in.Take the interleaved binary string and split it into .Convert each 5-bit chunk into a Base32 character.Base32 Alphabet Used in GeoHashing:0123456789bcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzNote: The letters , , , and  are intentionally omitted to avoid confusion with similar-looking digits or letters (, , etc.).This step compresses a potentially long binary string into a , usually between , depending on the desired precision.Let’s say your interleaved binary string is:Break it into 5-bit groups and convert each chunk into a Base32 character:Each additional character in the GeoHash increases the precision of the location.You can  of your spatial encoding just by adjusting the number.GeoHashing offers benefits that are highly valuable in location-based services:Efficient Proximity SearchInstead of range queries on lat/lon, you can:Use GeoHash prefix matchingSearch within a bounding box by comparing string prefixesDatabases like PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and MongoDB can:Index strings faster than floating-point pairsUse trie or B-tree-based lookups for prefix searchGeoHashes are great for sharding data in distributed systems:Assign prefixes to different servers/partitionsKeep nearby data close togetherGeoHashing is widely used in location-based apps and geospatial databases. Here are some real-world examples where GeoHashing shines:Ridesharing Platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft)GeoHashes can be used to group drivers and riders into  based on their current location.When a rider requests a trip, the system calculates their GeoHash (e.g., to 6 or 7 characters).It then quickly finds drivers in the same or neighboring GeoHash cells, drastically reducing the search space.This enables real-time proximity matching without scanning all active drivers.Food Delivery Services (e.g., Swiggy, Zomato)When a user opens the app to browse nearby restaurants:Their coordinates are converted into a GeoHash.The backend queries all restaurants whose stored GeoHashes  or its neighbors.This allows the system to serve relevant results , even with millions of entries in the database.Geospatial Databases (e.g., Elasticsearch, MongoDB)GeoHashing is often used under the hood in spatial indexing strategies. supports  aggregations to efficiently bucket documents by location. can store GeoHashes for fast, prefix-based querying on 2D location fields.GeoHashing is a powerful tool for spatial indexing but like any abstraction, it comes with trade-offs. It maps a 2D problem to a 1D problem, allowing for extremely fast prefix searches on standard database indexes. You can easily "zoom in" or "zoom out" by simply adjusting the length of the geohash string you use for querying. This is great for map UIs. It scales horizontally very well. The workload is easily distributable. It works with any database that supports string indexing (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.). You must query neighboring cells to avoid missing nearby points that fall across a boundary. This adds a little complexity to the query logic. Geohash cells are rectangular, and their shape distorts and becomes less square-like as you move away from the equator. This means a geohash doesn't represent a uniform circular area. Two points can be in the same geohash cell but at opposite corners, making them farther apart than a point in a neighboring cell. This is why the final, precise distance calculation is necessary. On its own, geohashing is a proximity search, not a true "k-Nearest Neighbors" search. You must combine it with a post-filtering distance calculation to get accurate k-NN results.Now let’s look at how to practically implement GeoHashing to build a location-based feature like showing nearby restaurants.Let's say we have a  table in our database.To enable fast geospatial queries:We add a new column called .Every time a restaurant is created or its location is updated, we:Calculate its GeoHash (e.g., with ).Store it in the  column.This prepares the data for efficient prefix-based lookups.Since GeoHash is stored as a string, we can index it with a  which enables fast, lexicographical prefix filtering.2. Querying for Nearby ItemsLet's say a user is at a location that maps to GeoHash: .To find nearby restaurants within, say, a , the most basic query would be:This works well in many cases, but there's a .What if the user is standing  of the  cell, and the closest restaurant is just  in a neighboring cell like ?The query above would  that restaurant even though it may be just 20 meters away.3. The Solution: Include Neighboring CellsEach GeoHash defines a bounding box. If we also consider the 8 immediate neighbors around that box, we cover the full surrounding area, eliminating blind spots at cell edges. Capture user's current latitude and longitude. Convert that location to a GeoHash with your chosen precision (e.g., ). Use a GeoHash utility/library to get the 8 surrounding GeoHashes. Query the database for items whose geohash starts with  of these 9 prefixes (the user's cell + 8 neighbors).The GeoHash-based prefix query is , but still slightly approximate.So once we get the candidate set of restaurants, we do a second, more precise filtering step:Use the  or  to compute the  between the user’s location and each candidate. any restaurants that fall  the desired radius (e.g., beyond 200m). the remaining results by distance to return the nearest ones first.The expensive Haversine computation is done on  of rows, not , which keeps the system performant.While  is a fast, lightweight, and scalable approach to spatial indexing, it's not the only option. Several other data structures are commonly used in geospatial systems, each with their own strengths and trade-offs:These are tree-based spatial partitioning structures that recursively divide the space into smaller regions. divide 2D space into four quadrants at each level. divide k-dimensional space by alternating splitting axes (e.g., latitude and longitude).GeoHashing can be conceptually seen as a simplified, linearized representation of a , following a space-filling curve like a Z-order (Morton) curve. are commonly used in spatial databases such as  (PostgreSQL extension), , and .They group nearby objects into .Each node in the tree contains the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) that encloses its children.This structure supports efficient queries for containment, intersection, and nearest neighbors.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: First, the Rust language is continuing to become more well-integrated into the kernel. At the top of my list is that the kernel now boasts Rust bindings for the driver core and PCI device subsystem. This approach will make it easier to add new Rust-based hardware drivers to Linux. Additionally, new Rust abstractions have been integrated into the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM), particularly for ioctl handling, file/GEM memory management, and driver/device infrastructure for major GPU vendors, such as AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. These changes should reduce vulnerabilities and optimize graphics performance. This will make gamers and AI/ML developers happier.
 
Linux 6.16 also brings general improvements to Rust crate support. Crate is Rust's packaging format. This will make it easier to build, maintain, and integrate Rust kernel modules into the kernel. For those of you who still love C, don't worry. The vast majority of kernel code remains in C, and Rust is unlikely to replace C soon. In a decade, we may be telling another story. Beyond Rust, this latest release also comes with several major file system improvements. For starters, the XFS filesystem now supports large atomic writes. This capability means that large multi-block write operations are 'atomic,' meaning all blocks are updated or none. This enhances data integrity and prevents data write errors. This move is significant for companies that use XFS for databases and large-scale storage.
 
Perhaps the most popular Linux file system, Ext4, is also getting many improvements. These boosts include faster commit paths, large folio support, and atomic multi-fsblock writes for bigalloc filesystems. What these improvements mean, if you're not a file-system nerd, is that we should see speedups of up to 37% for sequential I/O workloads. If your Linux laptop doubles as a music player, another nice new feature is that you can now stream your audio over USB even while the rest of your system is asleep. That capability's been available in Android for a while, but now it's part of mainline Linux.
 
If security is a top priority for you, the 6.16 kernel now supports Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and Intel Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX). This addition, along with Linux's improved support for AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization and Secure Memory Encryption (SEV-SNP), enables you to encrypt your software's memory in what's known as confidential computing. This feature improves cloud security by encrypting a user's virtual machine memory, meaning someone who cracks a cloud can't access your data. Linux 6.16 also delivers several chip-related upgrades. It introduces support for Intel's Advanced Performance Extensions (APX), doubling x86 general-purpose registers from 16 to 32 and boosting performance on next-gen CPUs like Lunar Lake and Granite Rapids Xeon. Additionally, the new CONFIG_X86_NATIVE_CPU option allows users to build processor-optimized kernels for greater efficiency.
 
Support for Nvidia's AI-focused Blackwell GPUs has also been improved, and updates to TCP/IP with DMABUF help offload networking tasks to GPUs and accelerators. While these changes may go unnoticed by everyday users, high-performance systems will see gains and OpenVPN users may finally experience speeds that challenge WireGuard.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Emperor Titus</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/emperor-titus</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6883666ff6d4262b07709e34/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Ugy1gMg_AykCxT4FGbq38WzTDp2afzhEp__o8j8y8SA" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode, we explore the remarkable - and often overlooked - life of Emperor Titus.

It had a lot of issues, yes, but it also had a lot of potential. There was a clear reverence for both Lord of the Rings and the life-sim genre on display, and considering the game had been delayed until the following year, it felt like both the developers and I were on the same page when it came to the game being undercooked. Imagine my surprise, then, when I booted up the launch version of Tales of the Shire and found the experience more or less unchanged.Wētā Workshop's Tales of the Shire feels incomplete. Gameplay is limited and monotonous, its story and characters are forgettable, performance is very rough, and while there's some charm to the game's clunky-looking world and the hobbits who inhabit it, more often than not, the visuals come across as low-quality and dated rather than whimsical. Despite playing it on two different consoles--Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck--both experiences suffered from numerous bugs and visual hiccups. While its mechanics are fine enough and there are some cute ideas nestled within, Tales of the Shire is regrettably unpolished and unengaging--and considering how populated the cozy game genre is, you'd be hard pressed to find a reason to play it in its current state.Set in the village of Bywater (though it should be noted that the "village" part is hotly contested by its residents and serves as the crux of the game), Tales of the Shire sees you take on the role of a hobbit leaving the town of Bree to start a new life somewhere peaceful and pastoral. Though the game's character creator is not particularly robust, it's also not egregiously limited, and allowed me to create a charmingly plump hobbit with a mess of dark, curly hair, thick lashes, and two minimally hair-covered feet. Using the game's suggested hobbit names, I named my maiden fair Jessamine--a clever play on my own name– and climbed aboard the carriage of a lanky, bearded wizard who was definitely Gandalf--wink wink. From there, we rode in what would be the first of the game's  awkward quiets to Bywater.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cisco Donates the AGNTCY Project to the Linux Foundation</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/07/29/2053245/cisco-donates-the-agntcy-project-to-the-linux-foundation?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 22:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cisco has donated its AGNTCY initiative to the Linux Foundation, aiming to create an open-standard "Internet of Agents" to allow AI agents from different vendors to collaborate seamlessly. The project is backed by tech giants like Google Cloud, Dell, Oracle and Red Hat. "Without such an interoperable standard, companies have been rushing to build specialized AI agents," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. "These work in isolated silos that cannot work and play well with each other. This, in turn, makes them less useful for customers than they could be." From the report: AGNTCY was first open-sourced by Cisco in March 2025 and has since attracted support from over 75 companies. By moving it under the Linux Foundation's neutral governance, the hope is that everyone else will jump on the AGNTCY bandwagon, thus making it an industry-wide standard. The Linux Foundation has a long history of providing common ground for what otherwise might be contentious technology battles. The project provides a complete framework to solve the core challenges of multi-agent collaboration:
 
- Agent Discovery: An Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF) acts like a "DNS for agents," allowing them to find and understand the capabilities of others.
- Agent Identity: A system for cryptographically verifiable identities ensures agents can prove who they are and perform authorized actions securely across different vendors and organizations.
- Agent Messaging: A protocol named Secure Low-latency Interactive Messaging (SLIM) is designed for the complex, multi-modal communication patterns of agents, with built-in support for human-in-the-loop interaction and quantum-safe security.

- Agent Observability: A specialized monitoring framework provides visibility into complex, multi-agent workflows, which is crucial for debugging probabilistic AI systems.
 
You may well ask, aren't there other emerging AI agency standards? You're right. There are. These include the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, which was also recently contributed to the Linux Foundation, and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). AGNTCY will help agents using these protocols discover each other and communicate securely. In more detail, it looks like this: AGNTCY enables interoperability and collaboration in three primary ways:
 
- Discovery: Agents using the A2A protocol and servers using MCP can be listed and found through AGNTCY's directories. This enables different agents to discover each other and understand their functions.

- Messaging: A2A and MCP communications can be transported over SLIM, AGNTCY's messaging protocol designed for secure and efficient agent interaction.

- Observability: The interactions between these different agents and protocols can be monitored using AGNTCY's observability software development kits (SDKs), which increase transparency and help with debugging complex workflows You can view AGNTCY's code and documentary on GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tom Brady&apos;s Next Act Is a Mystery</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Sz07fFhSZ-8</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Sz07fFhSZ-8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:29:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What do celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro and Tom Brady have in common?

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from actual implementation.Once upon a time, there was a data processing startup.They convert raw data into a structured format.Yet they had only a few customers.So an on-premise server was enough.But one morning, they got a new customer with an extremely popular site.This means massive data storage needs.Yet their storage server had only limited capacity.So they moved to Amazon Simple Storage Service (), an object storage.It stores unstructured data without hierarchy.S3 provides a REST API via the web server.And stores metadata and file content separately for scale. It stores metadata of data objects in a key-value database. Also it caches the metadata for low latency and high availability.Although caching metadata offers performance, some requests might return an older version of metadata.Because there could be network partitions in a distributed architecture. This means writes go to one cache partition, while reads go to another cache partition. Thus causing eventual consistency.But they need strong consistency in data processing for ordering and correctness.While setting up extra app logic for strong consistency increases infrastructure complexity.CodeRabbit brings real-time, AI-powered code reviews straight into VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. It lets you:Get contextual feedback on every commit, not just at the PR stageCatch bugs, security flaws, and performance issues asyou codeApply AI-driven suggestions instantly to implement code changesDo code reviews in your IDE for free and in your PR for a paid subscriptionIt’s difficult to achieve strong consistency at scale without performance or availability tradeoffs.So smart engineers at Amazon used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.It means the write coordinator updates the cache first. Then updates the metadata store synchronously.Thus reducing the risk of a stale cache.Also they set up a separate service to track the cache freshness and called it . It stores only the latest version of a data object and keeps it lightweight (in-memory) for low latency. While the write coordinator notifies the witness whenever there’s a metadata update.Besides they introduced a transaction log in the metadata store. It tracks the order of operations and allows them to check if the cache is fresh.Here’s the read request workflow:The server queries the cache.It then asks the witness to understand if the cache has the latest data.The server queries the metadata store only if the cache is stale.Thus achieving strong consistency.Put simply, they find out if the metadata cache is fresh using the witness. Think of the  as a central observer of metadata changes and a checkpoint for reads.Also they assume the cache to be stale if the server cannot reach the witness. If so, they fetch the data directly from the metadata store.Yet the witness shouldn’t affect S3’s overall performance or 99.99% availability.So they scale the witness servers horizontally. And set up automation to replace failed servers quickly.Besides they redistribute the traffic when a witness server fails.S3 supports 100 trillion data objects at 10 million requests per second.It offers strong read-after-write consistency using the witness and a consistent metadata cache.Thus making the app logic simpler.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Meet the updated : an authorization solution that scales with your product.

We’re living through multiple crises — ecological, technological, political. But beneath all of that is something even deeper: a crisis of the self. Who are we, really? How did we come to see ourselves as separate from the world, from each other, from the systems that sustain us? And what if that way of thinking is what got us into this mess?

Today’s guest is Mark C. Taylor, philosopher, cultural critic, and author of After the Human. Mark and Sean discuss the philosophical roots of climate change, the dangers of individualism, the false promise of techno-utopianism, and what it might mean to shift from seeing ourselves as isolated egos to members of a vast, interdependent web. They talk about AI, death, Hegel, Descartes, hope, and why ideas matter.

This release will not include any removal or deprecation, but it is packed with an impressive number of enhancements.
Here are some of the features we are most excited about in this cycle!Please note that this information reflects the current state of v1.34 development and may change before release.Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.34The following list highlights some of the notable enhancements likely to be included in the v1.34 release,
but is not an exhaustive list of all planned changes.
This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.The core of DRA targets stableDynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) provides a flexible way to categorize,
request, and use devices like GPUs or custom hardware in your Kubernetes cluster.Since the v1.30 release, DRA has been based around claiming devices using  that are opaque to the core of Kubernetes.
The relevant enhancement proposal, KEP-4381, took inspiration from dynamic provisioning for storage volumes.
DRA with structured parameters relies on a set of supporting API kinds: ResourceClaim, DeviceClass, ResourceClaimTemplate,
and ResourceSlice API types under , while extending the  for Pods with a new  field.
The core of DRA is targeting graduation to stable in Kubernetes v1.34.With DRA, device drivers and cluster admins define device classes that are available for use.
Workloads can claim devices from a device class within device requests.
Kubernetes allocates matching devices to specific claims and places the corresponding Pods on nodes that can access the allocated devices.
This framework provides flexible device filtering using CEL, centralized device categorization, and simplified Pod requests, among other benefits.Once this feature has graduated, the  APIs will be available by default.ServiceAccount tokens for image pull authenticationThe ServiceAccount token integration for  credential providers is likely to reach beta and be enabled by default in Kubernetes v1.34.
This allows the  to use these tokens when pulling container images from registries that require authentication.That support already exists as alpha, and is tracked as part of KEP-4412.The existing alpha integration allows the  to use short-lived, automatically rotated ServiceAccount tokens (that follow OIDC-compliant semantics) to authenticate to a container image registry.
Each token is scoped to one associated Pod; the overall mechanism replaces the need for long-lived image pull Secrets.Adopting this new approach reduces security risks, supports workload-level identity, and helps cut operational overhead.
It brings image pull authentication closer to modern, identity-aware good practice.Pod replacement policy for DeploymentsAfter a change to a Deployment, terminating pods may stay up for a considerable amount of time and may consume additional resources.
As part of KEP-3973, the .spec.podReplacementPolicy field will be introduced (as alpha) for Deployments.If your cluster has the feature enabled, you'll be able to select one of two policies:Creates new pods as soon as old ones start terminating, resulting in faster rollouts at the cost of potentially higher resource consumption.Waits until old pods fully terminate before creating new ones, resulting in slower rollouts but ensuring controlled resource consumption.This feature makes Deployment behavior more predictable by letting you choose when new pods should be created during updates or scaling.
It's beneficial when working in clusters with tight resource constraints or with workloads with long termination periods.It's expected to be available as an alpha feature and can be enabled using the DeploymentPodReplacementPolicy and DeploymentReplicaSetTerminatingReplicas feature gates in the API server and kube-controller-manager.Production-ready tracing for  and API ServerTo address the longstanding challenge of debugging node-level issues by correlating disconnected logs,
KEP-2831 provides deep, contextual insights into the .This feature instruments critical  operations, particularly its gRPC calls to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), using the vendor-agnostic OpenTelemetry standard.
It allows operators to visualize the entire lifecycle of events (for example: a Pod startup) to pinpoint sources of latency and errors.
Its most powerful aspect is the propagation of trace context; the  passes a trace ID with its requests to the container runtime, enabling runtimes to link their own spans.This effort is complemented by a parallel enhancement, KEP-647, which brings the same tracing capabilities to the Kubernetes API server.
Together, these enhancements provide a more unified, end-to-end view of events, simplifying the process of pinpointing latency and errors from the control plane down to the node.
These features have matured through the official Kubernetes release process.
KEP-2831 was introduced as an alpha feature in v1.25, while KEP-647 debuted as alpha in v1.22.
Both enhancements were promoted to beta together in the v1.27 release.
Looking forward, Kubelet Tracing (KEP-2831) and API Server Tracing (KEP-647) are now targeting graduation to stable in the upcoming v1.34 release. and  traffic distribution for ServicesThe  field within a Kubernetes Service allows users to express preferences for how traffic should be routed to Service endpoints.KEP-3015 deprecates  and introduces two additional values:  and .
 is equivalent to the current .
 prioritizes sending traffic to endpoints on the same node as the client.This feature was introduced in v1.33 behind the PreferSameTrafficDistribution feature gate.
It is targeting graduation to beta in v1.34 with its feature gate enabled by default.Support for KYAML: a Kubernetes dialect of YAMLKYAML aims to be a safer and less ambiguous YAML subset, and was designed specifically
for Kubernetes. Whatever version of Kubernetes you use, you'll be able use KYAML for writing manifests
and/or Helm charts.
You can write KYAML and pass it as an input to  version of ,
because all KYAML files are also valid as YAML.
With kubectl v1.34, we expect you'll also be able to request KYAML output from  (as in ).
If you prefer, you can still request the output in JSON or YAML format.KYAML addresses specific challenges with both YAML and JSON.
YAML's significant whitespace requires careful attention to indentation and nesting,
while its optional string-quoting can lead to unexpected type coercion (for example: "The Norway Bug").
Meanwhile, JSON lacks comment support and has strict requirements for trailing commas and quoted keys.KEP-5295 introduces KYAML, which tries to address the most significant problems by:Always double-quoting value stringsLeaving keys unquoted unless they are potentially ambiguousAlways using  for mappings (associative arrays)This might sound a lot like JSON, because it is! But unlike JSON, KYAML supports comments, allows trailing commas, and doesn't require quoted keys.We're hoping to see KYAML introduced as a new output format for  v1.34.
As with all these features, none of these changes are 100% confirmed; watch this space!As a format, KYAML is and will remain a , ensuring that any compliant YAML parser can parse KYAML documents.
Kubernetes does not require you to provide input specifically formatted as KYAML, and we have no plans to change that.Fine-grained autoscaling control with HPA configurable toleranceKEP-4951 introduces a new feature that allows users to configure autoscaling tolerance on a per-HPA basis,
overriding the default cluster-wide 10% tolerance setting that often proves too coarse-grained for diverse workloads.
The enhancement adds an optional  field to the HPA's  and  sections,
enabling different tolerance values for scale-up and scale-down operations,
which is particularly valuable since scale-up responsiveness is typically more critical than scale-down speed for handling traffic surges.Released as alpha in Kubernetes v1.33 behind the  feature gate, this feature is expected to graduate to beta in v1.34.
This improvement helps to address scaling challenges with large deployments, where for scaling in,
a 10% tolerance might mean leaving hundreds of unnecessary Pods running.
Using the new, more flexible approach would enable workload-specific optimization for both
responsive and conservative scaling behaviors.New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes.
We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.34 as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.The Kubernetes v1.34 release is planned for Wednesday 27th August 2025. Stay tuned for updates!The simplest way to get involved with Kubernetes is to join one of the many Special Interest Groups (SIGs) that align with your interests.

Jeffrey Epstein was a college dropout with no formal financial training who amassed a fortune worth hundreds of millions of dollars and mingled with presidents and billionaires. Drawing on court records and media investigations we trace where Epstein's money came from and what happened to it? From his first job as a high school teacher to involvement in a Ponzi scheme, secretive offshore firms, and powerful clients like Les Wexner and Leon Black. As conspiracy theories swirl and official narratives shift, one question remains unanswered: where did Epstein's money actually come from?

The proposal includes two major changes. First, it introduces configuration stubs for popular AI development tools like Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codeium, Continue, Windsurf, and Aider. These are symlinked to a centralized documentation file to ensure consistency. Second, and more notably, it lays out official guidelines for how AI-generated contributions should be handled. According to the proposed documentation, AI assistants must identify themselves in commit messages using a Co-developed-by: tag, but they cannot use Signed-off-by:, which legally certifies the commit under the Developer Certificate of Origin. That responsibility remains solely with the human developer.
 
One example shared in the patch shows a simple fix to a typo in the kernel's OPP documentation. Claude, an AI assistant, corrects "dont" to "don't" and commits the patch with the proper attribution: "Co-developed-by: Claude claude-opus-4-20250514." Levin's patch also creates a new section under Documentation/AI/ where the expectations and limitations of using AI in kernel development are laid out. This includes reminders to follow kernel coding standards, respect the development process, and understand licensing requirements. There are things AI often struggles with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Strange Math That Predicts (Almost) Anything</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZeIEiBrT_w</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KZeIEiBrT_w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 22:07:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How a feud in Russia led to modern prediction algorithms.

Real-time feature generation is critical for Lyft where accurate up-to-the-minute marketplace data is paramount for optimal operational efficiency. We will explore how the infrastructure handles the immense challenge of processing tens of millions of events per minute to generate features that truly reflect current marketplace conditions. Lyft has built this massive infrastructure over time, evolving from a humble start and a naive pipeline. Through lessons learned and iterative improvements, Lyft has made several trade-offs to achieve low-latency, real-time feature delivery. MLOps plays a critical role in managing the lifecycle of these real-time feature pipelines, including monitoring and deployment. We will discuss the practicalities of building and maintaining high-throughput, low-latency real-time feature generation systems that power Lyft’s dynamic marketplace and business-critical products.Rakesh Kumar is a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Lyft, specializing in building and scaling Machine Learning platforms. Rakesh has expertise in MLOps, including real-time feature generation, experimentation platforms, and deploying ML models at scale.

While the other 14 episodes felt like elongated commercials for the games they were based on, Pac-Man: Circle put an unexpected spin on Namco's iconic character, completely reimagining the pellet-gobbling yellow ball by introducing some harrowing violence and body horror to the equation. It was bold and imaginative, and as it turns out, still an extended commercial for an upcoming game.Bandai Namco announced Shadow Labyrinth just a few days after Secret Level's release, and like that episode, this 2D Metroidvania maintains the darker take on the classic character. Unfortunately, it fumbles the execution with a dull, opaque, and ultimately forgettable story, while frustrating, one-note combat and egregious checkpointing are further blemishes on what is a disappointing reinvention of the 45-year-old character.If you haven't seen Pac-Man: Circle beforehand, fear not. The 12-minute episode helps establish Shadow Labyrinth's basic premise, but it isn't required viewing. Either way, you're probably going to feel lost, as Shadow Labyrinth's story quickly devolves into a confluence of cryptic dialogue layered with tropes, sci-fi jargon, technobabble, and bloated self-seriousness.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Thermodynamics of Trading with Daniel Pontecorvo</title><link>https://signals-threads.simplecast.com/episodes/the-thermodynamics-of-trading-with-daniel-pontecorvo-75ib8seg</link><author>Jane Street</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.simplecast.com/audio/173026e7-14f0-44e7-8362-8c1923903f77/episodes/87e54873-8df0-4896-8f9d-c7413f40d6e3/audio/29504133-a7d5-41c7-9c47-10ed9f39608b/default_tc.mp3?aid=rss_feed&amp;feed=L9810DOa" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 18:21:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://signals-threads.simplecast.com/">Podcast - Signals and Threads</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel Pontecorvo runs the “physical engineering” team at Jane Street.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there was a 2-person startup.Yet they had a tiny website and only a few customers.So they merged the code directly into the main branch.But one morning, their site became extremely popular.And the number of customers and feature requests started to skyrocket.So they hired more developers and implemented extra features.Yet each developer wrote code with their personal preferences.Thus worsening the code quality and standards. Also increasing the number of bugs.So they started doing code reviews before merging new code into the codebase.A  means someone other than the author reviews the code.Although it temporarily solved their code quality problem, there were newer issues.They followed a strict review process and spent time on minor issues.Put simply, they asked for low-priority changes on a tight deadline ticket.It means delayed pull requests and slow developer velocity.Besides having teams across different time zones worsened the situation.They didn’t have set guidelines for code reviews.So developers forced their personal preferences during reviews.It means unnecessary disagreements and demotivated developers.Also feedback with a toxic and mean tone made things worse.There’s a risk of misunderstanding feedback in remote or asynchronous reviews.Also a reviewer must understand new code and how it works with the codebase.So the reviewer might get overloaded with code reviews and parallel development tasks.Besides the reviewers might miss bugs even with thorough reviews, especially in large pull requests.I’m happy to partner with  on this newsletter. I’ve seen code reviews delaying feature deliveries by days and overloading reviewers. I genuinely believe CodeRabbit solves this problem.Both the author and the reviewer should respect each other’s time and efforts.Here are some guidelines for the code author:Follow the project's style guide.Keep the changes small to make the reviews easy.Review the code yourself before asking others to save time.Use existing code patterns, and not personal preferences, if a style is unspecified.Tag only the fewest number of reviewers to save everyone’s time.Write a clear message about the changes for the reviewer to understand easily.Use facts and data to resolve design debates, rather than opinions.Code reviews are each software engineer's responsibility.Here are some guidelines for the reviewer:Respond to a review request within 24 hours.Reserve at least one calendar slot each day for code reviews.Keep the reviews polite and constructive; don’t criticize the author.Document common review points and use a review checklist for consistent reviews.Discuss the issue directly with the author when there’s a disagreement. Then document the solution for future reference.Share the documentation in review comments if necessary to encourage knowledge sharing.Approve the pull request when it’s good enough and allow minor issues to be fixed later.Remember, code reviews are about making progress and not perfection. So just make sure each change maintains or improves the codebase's health.Version control platforms, such as GitHub and GitLab, include pull request features for code review. They allow inline comments, approvals, and automated checks. Also there is peer review software, such as Gerrit, for advanced workflows.Here’s the code review workflow from a developer perspective:Write code on a separate Git branch to isolate changes.Get instant feedback and fix suggestions with code editor extensions, such as CodeRabbit. Thus catching problems even before creating a pull request and saving infrastructure resources.Commit code with a clear commit message and push it to the remote repository.Open a pull request from the current branch to the target branch.Run automated checks on the code, such as unit tests, static code analysis, security scans, and linting, to ensure code correctness. It finds style issues, code smells, or security vulnerabilities, so reviewers can focus on high-level feedback.Find issues and get auto-fix suggestions using CodeRabbit. This approach improves developer velocity.Generate a summary of code changes using CodeRabbit. It helps reviewers understand complex changes quickly. And assess the impact on the codebase.The reviewer checks the changed files and leaves constructive feedback via comments.Fix the code based on the reviewer’s comments.Upload changes to the same pull request and make sure automated checks pass again.Reply to the reviewer's feedback and resolve comments.At least one reviewer approves the pull request.Merge the pull request into the target branch and trigger continuous deployment ().CD pipeline builds and deploys the change to the staging environment.Once the staging tests pass, the change gets released to production. means merging code changes regularly into a central repository. While  is about automatically releasing changes that pass checks into production. is an AI code review tool to reduce developer workload.Here’s how it helps with code review flow:Do routine checks and reduce the time spent on reviews from days to minutes. Thus improving developer velocity.Do consistent reviews without getting tired or biased. Thus reducing the risk of missing important issues from human mistakes.Provide mentorship to junior engineers through detailed feedback.Put simply, CodeRabbit complements human reviewers. It serves 1+ million repositories and has reviewed over 10 million pull requests. And it remains the most installed app on GitHub and GitLab.

Framing his actions in part as an initiative to fight antisemitism, President Donald Trump has been targeting diversity, equity and inclusion as well as educational independence at Harvard and universities across the country.  Trump has threatened Harvard’s nonprofit tax status and accreditation, frozen more than $2.6 billion in research funding and moved to cancel about $100 million worth of its federal contracts. He is also trying to bar Harvard from enrolling international students, a key source of revenue. Harvard has been fighting back in court on all fronts. But how long can it resist pressure from Trump?

After a year marred by shock layoffs, the delay of its upcoming shooter, Marathon, following poor player feedback during betas, and less-than-favorable views about Destiny’s monetization system, all eyes were on the studio to see where it would take its most beloved franchise next. 2024’s Destiny 2 expansion, The Final Shape, was one of the series’ most successful. It beautifully and coherently tied up a decade’s worth of story, culminating in a tense and exciting battle against the biggest, baddest Big Bad that the universe had ever seen: The Witness.Naturally, following such a satisfying and full-circle conclusion, Destiny players were concerned about what a new saga would look like. The seasonal content that followed The Final Shape was lacklustre at best, with major character deaths thrown in seemingly for the shock factor rather than meaningfully contributing to the narrative. As a result, player numbers plummeted to some of the lowest that Destiny 2 has ever seen. Bungie’s best-in-class narrative team seemed to be floundering, so when I jumped into The Edge of Fate, I was skeptical, to say the least. I need not have worried. Well, not for the narrative aspect, anyway. From a gameplay perspective, there are a lot of concerning stumbles.The 14-mission campaign is monotonous, at best. While Bungie has completely reworked the armor and gear systems--more on that later--the best aspects of it are locked behind the now-trademark Destiny 2 grind. With your power level reset and the weapons in your Vault effectively powerless, Bungie claimed this was to put everyone on an even footing ahead of the new saga, but in reality it feels like years of work and thousands of hours of grinding for the best weapons was a pointless endeavour.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Congress Is Seriously Investigating UFOs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSOzBMjww9o</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VSOzBMjww9o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 20:20:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In honor of UFO Day this month, we’re examining all of the evidence to uncover the truth about UFOs.

Recent observations of exoplanet K2-18b have revealed compelling evidence for potential life beyond Earth. This discovery raises profound questions: Are there intelligent beings elsewhere in the cosmos? Could they have already visited our planet? In this video, we’re digging into the evidence, examining UFO (or UAP) sightings and investigating whether the Pentagon is concealing evidence from the public.

History Hit’s Tristan Hughes visits the Channel coast in Kent to learn about two key gateways into Roman Britain. First, he visits Dover Castle with Dr Simon Elliott to see the striking remains of the Pharos, one of the best preserved Roman lighthouses in the world. He then visits an exciting excavation 15 miles west at Lympne, where Simon, fellow archaeologist Dr Richard Taylor and their team believe they’ve located another key port that linked Roman Britain to the continent.

This video shines light on the importance of the English Channel to the Romans. It was the vital waterway that connected Britannia with the rest of the Empire. Serviced by ports, forts and lighthouses, vital to the success of Roman Britain

This trend has stretched on for years, and can still be seen today. Focusing on looping residential hallways in first-person while ghosts poke their heads out at scripted moments, many creators loved P.T. but often took the wrong lessons from the legendary playable teaser. At first glance, Luto is the latest in a long line of P.T. wannabes, but it doesn't take long for it to stand out from the pack as an especially unpredictable and unconventional horror story.In Luto, you play a character stuck in an emotional rut and a literal loop. Waking to a smashed bathroom mirror, protagonist Sam exits into an L-shaped hallway, passes some locked doors, heads down the stairs, and out the front door. The next day, Sam wakes to a smashed bathroom mirror, exits into an L-shaped hallway, passes some locked doors, heads down the stairs, and out the front door. The next day--well, you get it. But where so many games struggle to distance themselves from Kojima's original blueprint, Luto takes this kernel of an idea and expands on it in creative, and sometimes wondrous, ways.I originally played a demo of Luto a few years ago, and I was surprised to hear a narrator has since been attached to this horror story. The voice of an almost gratingly upbeat British man gives the game the sense of something more like The Stanley Parable, which rings only truer when the narrator seems to comment on what I'm doing with reactivity and near-omniscience. I hated this addition to the game at first. The creaks of the floorboards in the empty house, once so eerie in the demo, were now drowned out by a narrator who seemed to spoonfeed me the story. Why did they spoil its tense atmosphere with this chatterbox?Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How America Became a Two-Party Nation | Civics Made Easy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF5uaerHPzg</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MF5uaerHPzg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 16:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of "Civics Made Easy," Ben Sheehan unpacks America's complex relationship with political parties, from George Washington's wariness to today's two-party dominance.

--

The average person poops out approximately 11,030 kilograms of cumulative waste in a lifetime. That’s the equivalent of more than 6 SUVs. Oftentimes, that poop is brown. Why is that, considering all the comestibles one consumes? And what’s going on when poop appears in different colors and textures? Hannibal Person explains the colorful choreography going on inside your bowels.

Here’s why.

For decades parents and pediatricians have followed the CDC’s Childhood Immunization Schedule. It’s a monthly schedule that lays out the age a child should be vaccinated for common infectious diseases. Its main goal is to protect one of our most vulnerable populations: children, especially those under the age of one, and it’s been wildly successful at doing just that. Diseases like polio or measles that at one time left children paralyzed, brain damaged, or even dead were eliminated in the United States. 

In recent years, more and more parents are choosing to delay or even outright omit parts of this schedule and to be fair… It IS a very overwhelming thing. Why do young children need so many shots so quickly?
