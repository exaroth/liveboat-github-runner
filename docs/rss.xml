Israel has agreed to allow their passage as part of the ceasefire deal with the militant Hamas group. 
Gazans began returning on Monday morning after waiting days to cross. Their return had been delayed after Israel blocked their passage, accusing Hamas of breaching the terms of the truce by not freeing civilian hostages first. The militants have agreed to release more Israeli captives this week in exchange.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins. On today's show, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance. In geopolitics, in the space of several hours that rattled global markets, US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Colombia before abruptly pulling the threat after reaching a deal on the return of deported migrants. The White House claimed victory late on Sunday, saying Colombia had “agreed to all of President Trump’s terms” without delay, including the acceptance of deportees on US military aircraft. 
Today's guests: Neil Sorahan, Ryanair CFO and Tommy Ricketts, BeZero CEO and Co-founder.

Any posts mentioning DistroWatch and multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed.We've been hearing all week from readers who say they can no longer post about Linux on Facebook or share links to DistroWatch. Some people have reported their accounts have been locked or limited for posting about Linux.The sad irony here is that Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers.Unfortunately, there isn't anything we can do about this, apart from advising people to get their Linux-related information from sources other than Facebook. I've tried to appeal the ban and was told the next day that Linux-related material is staying on the cybersecurity filter. My Facebook account was also locked for my efforts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One in four 2020 Tesla Model 3 failed the Danish periodic inspection in 2024</title><link>https://fdm.dk/nyheder/bilist/2025-01-populaer-tesla-model-dumper-med-et-brag-til-syn</link><author>asp1</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 08:52:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tesla har mere end hver 3. af alle fejl]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Internet-Connected &apos;Smart&apos; Products for Babies Suddenly Start Charging Subscription Fees</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/0455205/internet-connected-smart-products-for-babies-suddenly-start-charging-subscription-fees?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The EFF has complained that in general "smart" products for babies "collect a ton of information about you and your baby on an ongoing basis". (For this year's "worst in privacy" product at CES they chose a $1,200 baby bassinet equipped with a camera, a microphone, and a radar sensor...) 

But today the Washington Post reported on a $1,700 bassinet that surprised the mother of a one-month-old when it "abruptly demanded money for a feature she relied on to soothe her baby to sleep."

The internet-connected bassinet... reliably comforted her 1-month-old — just as it had her first child — until it started charging $20 a month for some abilities, including one that keeps the bassinet's motion and sounds at one level all night. The level-lock feature previously was available without a fee. "It all felt really intrusive — like they went into our bedroom and clawed back this feature that we've been depending on...." When the Snoo's maker, Happiest Baby, introduced a premium subscription for some of the bassinet's most popular features in July, owners filed dozens of complaints to the Federal Trade Commission and the Better Business Bureau, coordinated review bombs and vented on social media — saying the company took advantage of their desperation for sleep to bait-and-switch them... 

Happiest Baby isn't the only baby gear company that has rolled out a subscription. In 2023, makers of the Miku baby monitor, which retails for up to $400, elicited similar fury from parents when it introduced a $10 monthly subscription for most features. A growing number of internet-connected products have lost software support or functionality after purchase in recent years, such as Spotify's Car Thing — a $90 Bluetooth streaming device that the company announced in May it plans to discontinue — and Levi's $350 smart jacket, which let users control their phones by swiping sensors on its sleeve... 

Seventeen consumer protection and tech advocacy groups cited Happiest Baby and Car Thing in a letter urging the FTC to create guidelines that ensure products retain core functionality without the imposition of fees that did not exist when the items were originally bought. 

The Times notes that the bassinets are often resold, so the subscription fees are partly to cover the costs of supporting new owners, according to Happiest Baby's vice president for marketing and communications. But the article three additional perspectives:

"This new technology is actually allowing manufacturers to change the way the status quo has been for decades, which is that once you buy something, you own it and you can do whatever you want. Right now, consumers have no trust that what they're buying is actually going to keep working." — Lucas Gutterman, who leads the Public Interest Research Group's "Design to Last" campaign.
 "It's a shame to be beholden to companies' goodwill, to require that they make good decisions about which settings to put behind a paywall. That doesn't feel good, and you can't always trust that, and there's no guarantee that next week Happiest Baby isn't going to announce that all of the features are behind a paywall." — Elizabeth Chamberlain, sustainability director at iFixit.
"It's no longer just an out-and-out purchase of something. It's a continuous rental, and people don't know that." — Natasha Tusikov, an associate professor at York University]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Three injured by car driven into a crowd in Philadelphia after Eagles playoff game</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7fjTXtXjEs</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/P7fjTXtXjEs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 08:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A car hit and injured three pedestrians in a crowd of people that was leaving the Philadelphia Eagles playoff game on Sunday night, police said.

A message from a colleague—who has since become a good friend—popped up on my screen, urging me to check my emails. When I opened my inbox, there it was: an email from the COO. The email announced an impending company-wide layoff and mentioned that, within a few minutes, I’d receive another email letting me know whether I was impacted. A short while later, the second email arrived. I was among those affected—along with most of my team.The situation felt surreal. One by one, my colleagues posted in our team chat, confirming they’d been impacted too. Before our accounts were locked, we quickly jumped on a call. We had just 30 minutes to have one final conversation as a team, to say our goodbyes. It was a bittersweet moment, sharing those last words with people I’d worked so closely with.It was difficult to process what was happening. Just ten months earlier, the company had gone through another round of layoffs. And at the beginning of the year, during the company’s kick-off event, the president assured us there wouldn’t be any more layoffs. They even said the company was performing well financially. So, why was this happening?Looking back, my colleagues and I were not entirely surprised by the layoff. There were several warning signs that hinted something was coming. I want to share these signs so you can be better prepared if you ever face a similar situation.1. Cancellation of Team EventsOne of the earliest indicators was the sudden cancellation of team events. When I heard from other teams that their off-site events were canceled without any clear explanation, it immediately raised red flags. These cancellations often signal that the company is going to announce something about the team structure and doesn’t want you to be with your team in the same place. This is because one of your teammates—or you—might be impacted, and you’d need to cancel flights, hotels, etc. To avoid dealing with these logistical issues, the company preemptively cancels the event.2. Unexpected Notifications About PackagesSome employees at the company received notifications about packages scheduled to arrive at their homes. This happens because services like DHL notify you through their app when a package is on the way. If your company requires you to return your work equipment, like a laptop, after being laid off, they often arrange for these shipping boxes to be delivered in advance. If you unexpectedly see a notification about a package from your company’s IT provider, it’s a strong sign that a layoff is imminent—and you may be impacted.3. Lack of Vision from LeadershipThe absence of a clear vision from leadership is one of the most common signs of an impending layoff. During off-site or kick-off events, you might notice that leaders seem unsure of the company’s direction. When this lack of clarity is followed by team restructuring, and then another restructuring just a few months later, it becomes evident that the leadership is struggling to find focus. Ultimately, this cycle often ends with a layoff, accompanied by yet another round of restructuring for those who remain.4. Sudden, Vague MeetingsAnother sign is the appearance of unexpected, vague meetings on your calendar. These meetings are marked as “important” with no clear agenda, and attendance is mandatory. If this happens, it’s often a precursor to a layoff announcement. Public companies, in particular, may choose to send layoff notices via email to align the timing with when they notify investors.5. Timing Around Quarterly ResultsIf your company is publicly traded, layoffs are frequently announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports. This can be especially stressful because, leading up to every financial results announcement, employees may anxiously wait to see if layoffs will accompany the news. If no layoffs are announced, you know you’re safe—for at least one more quarter.When I looked back on my time at the company and all the things I had accomplished, I was surprised to be impacted by the layoffs. It wasn’t because I thought I was better than others—it was because I believed I was doing more than what was expected of me. However, during a layoff, it seems that who you are and what you do doesn’t matter. In most cases, the decision is made by people who don’t even know you. This realization made me question the concept of work, which is part of the reason I’m writing this blog post.I was hired as a Backend Developer. When I joined my team, I noticed a project that needed a developer to implement the client-side feature in React Native. Although I had no prior experience with React Native, I had worked with React before, so I volunteered for the task. I shipped the feature without any issues, received positive feedback from my team and lead, and eventually, my title was changed to Developer, making me a full-stack developer.In some instances, I worked on projects independently, always aligning with my team and ensuring my work was reviewed. I would implement the backend first and then move on to the client-side. This was my expected role, and in performance reviews, I was consistently rated as a high performer. Yet, I was always doing more than what was expected of me.Sometimes, I worked on small features I thought would enhance the app. These features might not have been used by many, but they provided significant value to heavy users. Occasionally, I shipped these under the radar. I created dashboards to measure the impact of my team’s work, helping us focus on features that would bring the most value to users. I also built proof-of-concept features based on user requests to show leadership how easily they could be implemented, advocating for their prioritization. Additionally, I participated in hackdays, creating projects to showcase innovative ideas.On several occasions, I was selected for special projects outside my team. These projects often came directly from the CEO, and I was chosen because I constantly wanted to do more for the company and our users. For some of these projects, I worked more than eight hours a day, including weekends. A few of these initiatives were mentioned in financial reports, praised by the CEO during all-hands meetings, or retweeted multiple times by the CEO on Twitter.Over time, I gained the attention of senior management in my business unit, which consisted of about 400 people. I began directly interacting with the VP of Product and the VP of Engineering, both of whom were four or five levels above me. Occasionally, the VP of Product would message me directly to ask if a feature was feasible to implement. Later, the VP of Engineering started scheduling regular one-on-one meetings with me, which was highly uncommon. During these calls, he told me multiple times that if I continued working at this level, I could quickly climb the ladder to become a Staff Developer. He wasn’t the only one saying this to me.Beyond my immediate role, I also sought ways to contribute to the broader company. Whenever a new tool was introduced, I would explore it, write detailed articles about my findings, and share them to help other teams use the tool more effectively.I referred many friends and former colleagues to the company because I believed in its mission. If I recall correctly, I referred over ten people, four of whom received offers, and three were ultimately hired. I also encouraged many others to consider joining the company.I even initiated discussions about translating our website into Turkish to support the many customers we had in Turkey. A few weeks before the layoff announcement, I was helping a team working on this project find a Turkish-speaking content designer because they noticed my willingness to assist.Additionally, I tried to convince friends who were CTOs at major e-commerce companies to migrate their websites to our platform. Whenever I received job offers from e-commerce companies on LinkedIn, I used those opportunities to promote our platform instead. I passed along leads to the sales team and later noticed that one of those companies had indeed moved to our platform.I’m not sharing all of this to brag but to highlight that, in the end, none of it mattered. On the day I announced I had been laid off, I received numerous messages from colleagues, even those I hadn’t worked with directly, telling me that I had inspired and motivated them. While those messages were heartwarming, they didn’t change the reality: to the company, I was just a row in an Excel sheet.Layoffs were uncommon when I started working, and being a developer felt like an incredibly safe job. In most professions, the unspoken rule was simple: if you performed well and the company was financially stable, your job was secure.But today, companies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead—only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn’t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I’m not sure how they could fix it.What’s particularly strange is that the layoffs predominantly affect individual contributors—the people who have little say in deciding the company’s direction. These are the team members closest to the users, the ones who spend hours planning how to improve the product. But after those plans are made, leadership often swoops in and redirects efforts toward entirely different goals. You trust their judgment, work on their priorities, and deliver on time. Then, when the arbitrary goals they set aren’t met, the company decides to cut staff. Those who made the poor decisions remain, and some are even promoted, while the people carrying out the work are let go. It feels surreal—like an episode from Silicon Valley—but this is how big companies operate.I’m not alone in feeling this way. Many friends and ex-colleagues who’ve been laid off in recent years share similar experiences. They’ve lost trust in their employers. They believe their efforts won’t matter in the long run and anticipate being part of the next layoff cycle. As a result, they only do what’s strictly required to avoid a performance improvement plan. No one goes above and beyond anymore; no one takes initiative to improve things. Why? Because it doesn’t matter. They’ve seen firsthand that it changes nothing.For those like me who’ve experienced layoffs, work has become just that—work. You do what’s assigned, and if your company squanders your potential or forces you to waste time on unnecessary projects, you simply stop caring. You collect your paycheck at the end of the month, and that’s it. This is the new modern work: no more striving to be 40% better every year.Since I was working for a German entity of a company, I want to address a common myth about job security in Germany. Many people believe that it’s nearly impossible to be fired in Germany. While this is partially true for individuals who have completed their probation period, it doesn’t hold up in the context of layoffs. If a company decides to lay off, for instance, 40 employees, German law doesn’t prevent this. Instead, the law enforces a social scoring system to determine who is affected, prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable employees, such as those with children. In this sense, when it comes to layoffs, the difference between Germany and the US is minimal.When I talk to friends who were laid off in recent years, we often reflect on what we could have done differently. Here are some of the lessons we’ve learned:Stick to your contract hours. If your contract says 40 hours, work 40 hours—no more, no less. Protect your personal time and well-being.Avoid going above and beyond with initiatives. Many companies encourage impactful work to earn promotions, but instead of chasing internal advancements, focus on switching companies to achieve your next career step.Always keep interviewing. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen is stopping interviews after starting a new job, trusting in the company. Instead, continuously explore opportunities so that if a layoff happens, you already have other options lined up.Leverage external offers for salary growth. Companies often resist giving substantial raises to existing employees but pay top dollar for new hires. Regularly interview elsewhere, and if you get an offer with a 20% or higher salary increase, consider taking it. Many people have seen their compensation triple or quadruple this way in just a few years.Don’t overthink your résumé. Worrying about short experiences on your CV isn’t worth it. You can always tailor your résumé—leave out brief roles, or consolidate short-term jobs as freelance experience. Ultimately, your résumé is just a starting point; your skills will be assessed during the interview process.You’ve probably noticed that I didn’t mention the name of the company I was laid off from. That’s because I believe it’s irrelevant. Everything I’ve shared reflects the current state of the tech industry. It might differ at very small companies, but once you work at a company with more than 100 employees, you’ll likely encounter many of the same patterns I’ve described.I’ve wanted to write about this topic for a long time, but it’s been difficult to find the energy. The subject itself is a deep disappointment for me, and every time I reflect on layoffs, it makes me profoundly sad. It’s a stark reminder of how companies treat workers as disposable. Before you join, they go to great lengths to make you feel valued and excited to accept their offer. You meet multiple people, and some even offer signing bonuses. But when layoffs come, you’re reduced to a name on a list. During the exit interview, a random person from the company reads a prepared script and can’t answer your questions. The HR team that once worked to make you feel valued doesn’t even conduct an actual conversation with you. That random person becomes the last connection you have to a company you spent years at.The layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work now. I don’t think that I’ll be the same person again.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: 80th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5CGbOznJF4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/d5CGbOznJF4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 08:13:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elderly survivors of Nazi Germany's horrors during World War II mark the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Nazi extermination and labor camp, by the Soviet troops on Jan. 27, 1945.

Hashify provides two approaches tailored to different dataset sizes. For smaller maps (fewer than 500 entries), it uses an optimized method inspired by GNU's perf, while for larger maps, it relies on the PTHash Minimal Perfect Hashing algorithm to ensure fast and compact lookups.Hashify was built with performance in mind. Benchmarks show that tiny maps are over  than the Rust phf crate (which uses the CHD algorithm), and large maps are about . It’s an excellent choice for applications like compilers, parsers, or any lookup-intensive algorithms where speed and efficiency are critical.This initial release uses the FNV-1a hashing algorithm, which performs best with maps consisting of short strings. If you’re interested in using alternative hashing algorithms, modifying the crate is straightforward. Feel free to open a GitHub issue to discuss or contribute support for other algorithms.Looking forward to hearing your feedback! The crate is available on crates.io.: If you’re attending FOSDEM'25 this Saturday in Brussels, I’ll be presenting Stalwart Mail Server (a Rust-based mail server) at 12 PM in the Modern Email devroom. Come by if you’re curious about Rust in email systems, or catch me before or after the presentation to talk about Rust, hashify, or anything else Rust-related.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: European Union Foreign Affairs ministers arrive at EU Council</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6lMQolxMxk</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/c6lMQolxMxk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 08:07:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[EU Foreign Affairs ministers arrive at the European Union Council.

The drug, Lenacapavir, requires just two injections a year and has shown remarkable success in trials. 
But there's a problem: it currently costs each patient more than forty thousand dollars per year - that's far too expensive for most.

(It can take up to four years to connect a data center to the grid, one data center trade group says in the article — years longer than it takes to build a new data center.) 

But the idea of bypassing the grid is "raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid."

Front and center is the data center that Amazon's cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania. The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS — called a "behind the meter" connection — is the first such to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts — about 40% of the plant's capacity — to the data center. That's enough to power more than a half-million homes... [But the FERC's 2-1 rejection "was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study."] 

In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid... The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators, in particular, are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they have been forced to compete in some markets against a flood of cheap natural gas as well as state-subsidized solar and wind energy. Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else... 

Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be "extreme" if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory. Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China&apos;s DeepSeek Showcases Tech Advances Despite US Curbs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISXdF42QHTQ</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ISXdF42QHTQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 05:53:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[China's DeepSeek has taken the world by surprise with its powerful model, showcasing advances in the country's AI technology despite US restrictions.

If you can’t apply the knowledge immediately, postpone reading it.Each book has taught me something or sparked a new idea and way of thinking.It’s not necessary to apply everything from each book but rather look for the things that most suits you at the moment and adapt them to your lifestyle.A great mistake I made in the past was to try to apply everything on 100%.The true wisdom comes when you find the 10-20% of the book to apply at the moment.At each phase of our lives we need different things, so think twice before applying anything directly. Be conscious.Don’t try to read and follow everything at once.Think in advance how reading a particular book will help you in your day-to-day tasks, job, and personal life.If you can’t apply the knowledge immediately, postpone reading the book or newsletter.As you might see, there’re no courses. My preferred way is to read and apply what I read immediately in my day-to-day job or side-projects.That's all for today.

The Times notes that "many fans find out about the Excel championship through ESPN's annual obscure sports showcase, where it is sandwiched between competitions like speed chess and the World Dog Surfing Championships." But the contest's organizer envisions tournaments with "more spectators, bigger sponsors and a million-dollar prize" — even though this year's prize was $5,000 and a pro wrestling-style championship belt.

The format for the finals was a mock-up of World of Warcraft, an online role-playing game. It required the 12 men (this particular nerdfest was mostly a guy thing) to design Excel formulas for tracking 20 avatars and their vital signs... To prepare, [competitor Diarmuid] Early adjusted the width of his Excel columns with the precision of a point guard lining up a 3-point shot. [Andrew] Ngai queued up a YouTube compilation of "focus music". After an announcer kicked off the 40-minute event — "Five, four, three, two, one, and Excel!" — the 12 players leaned over their keyboards and began plugging in formulas. One example: "=CountChar (Lower (D5),"W")" allowed one competitor, Michael Jarman, to figure out how many times the letter "W" appeared in a spreadsheet. 


ZDNet points out that there's a seven-hour livestream of the event that's "worth checking out for the opening theme song alone." 

The New York Times closes their article with a quote from super-fan Erik Oehm, a software developer from San Francisco who called the event "the Super Bowl for Excel nerds". Oehm watched excitedly from the front row as this year's winner — Michael Jarman — finally raised the championship belt overhead while someone dumped glitter on him. And then he said... 

"You'd never see this with Google Sheets. You'd never get this level of passion."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Orbitiny Desktop Environment Released (Originally Announced as LQDE)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iayzwm/orbitiny_desktop_environment_released_originally/</link><author>/u/sash-au</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 03:49:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally, after about a month after the original announcement (LQDE), the  has been released.Built from the ground up using  and coded in C++,  is a new, 100% portable, innovative and traditional but modern looking desktop environment for Linux.  because it has features not seen in any other desktop environment before while keeping traditional aspects of computing alive (desktop icons, menus etc).Portable because you can run it on any distro and on any live CD and that's because everything gets saved inside the directory that gets created when the archive is extracted (this can be changed so that the settings go to $HOME/.config/orbitiny).One of these innovative features is  but more on that later in this post.It comes with its own set of utilities and applications. It has a device manager which can disable / enable devices by right-clicking the device and selecting  and all that without black-listing the whole kernel module so it targets the selected device only and nothing more.It has its own fully featured and innovative file manager, a fully featured desktop panel with 18 plugins with full and natural Drag&Drop support, a dedicated search utility, one integrated with the file manager while the other is a stand-alone one, a , hot-plug detection with desktop notifications and more. is  a derivative of or based on any other project. It started with a blank / main window - the one that you'd create in Qt Creator when you start a new project.So what is so special and innovative in ? I don't know where to start, here are some of the features that sets it apart from other DEs (I've probably missed some). - On the blank area of the desktop, draw a gesture pattern (like in a web browser) but on the desktop to perform an action, like for example, launch a custom command or use one of the built-in supported actions available to choose from. Up to 12 gestures are supported for both left and right mouse buttons, 12 per button + additional configurations for middle clicks. Gestures are drawn on the blank area of the desktop and they work regardless whether icons are turned off or on. When a file is  or  to the clipboard, a little icon emblem with a "cut" or "copy" symbol is attached to the icon to indicate that the file is on the clipboard, either copied or cut. If the file is a directory, and contents of that directory change (like a file is created or deleted), an emblem is attached to let you know that the folder contents have changed. - Drag a text file over another text file to add the contents of the dragged file to the target file. - If there is ASCII content on the clipboard, right click the files and select "" and the content will be appended to the end of the file. Prepending is also available. If the selected file is a folder, the text content will be pasted into that folder and a file gets generated automatically. There is also image pasting. If the clipboard has an image, right click + paste will generate an image file. - Select a set of folders on the desktop and click "Paste" and the content from theclipboard will be pasted to all of the selected folders. Text content will also be pasted automatically by generating a unique file name and a file (works with images too).Custom Desktop Directories - Choose any folder and use it as a desktop directory. It doesn't have to be . - Each screen is a separate desktop so on one screen you can have one desktop with its own set of icons (by selecting a desktop directory of your choice) and on another screen, you can have another desktop with its own icon by selecting a different desktop folder. Of course, works with wallpapers too. So it's like two different computers running on two screensBeautiful and Non-Blocking Custom Context Menus. Non-blocking means your traditional shortcuts you have assigned in X11, will continue to work when a context menu is open, the shortcut won't get caught/blocked by it like it is the case with many other applications that use standard context menus. The context menus are custom made, not using the QMenu component. - Select several folders, right click and select Open Terminal and a new terminal will open for all of the selected folders.Built-in Run Drop-down Box (Combo Box) in the context menus allows you to run a command against the selectedfiles (highly experimental and new).Multi Profile Support on the Panel - Right click the edge button on the panel and create a new profile or select one of the previously created ones to get a new configuration / sets of applets. You can switch between profiles like you switch different TV channels.Full Drag&Support on the Panel - Drop any File/Folder from the Desktop or a File Manager or Drag and Re-arrange any applet, any icon on the panel. No special "Edit Mode" is required. Just grab the applet on the panel or a file from the desktop / file manager and drop it straight onto the panel and an icon for it gets created or the dragged one gets re-positioned. So to be clear: Launch Thunar, Nemo, Dolphin or whatever and drop any file / folder from it onto the panel, either on the Quick Launch or anywhere else and a file icon gets created. This, Drag&Drop Support . The panel can be resized, and placed on any corner of the screen by dragging its handle or you can put it on the middle of the screen if you wish, or turn it into a dock with auto-resizing, or a deskbar that takes the width or the height of the screen. It's highly configurable. I use it as a deskbar as I am used to it.A Comprehensive Start Menu / Application Launcher applet and again with full Drag&Drop support. You can re-arrange icons within the menu, from / in the menu, and there is designated area for a sidebar too on the menu which you can also attach / remove icons from and in to it. - Perform custom actions on the selected files. Commands can be edited in the configuration file. inside the right-click context menu. - click any edge on the desktop to launch a dashboard window that shows you running tasks + installed applications. Search/Filter is available. At the moment, the running applications only work with X11. - All the files needed to run along with the applications it comes with can be downloaded to a USB flash drive (or a folder) along with the settings so you can just take the whole folder with you and run it on any Linux computer and the settings will remain the same so the settings are also portable. support. All the components mentioned here support both WINE and DOSBOX. This means, if you drop a Windows or DOS exe onto the panel and click on it to launch it or double click it from the file manager or the desktop, its path will be handed over to either WINE or DOSBOX to run it. - Remember this? Well, if you double click on a MAFF file, it will extract it in the /tmp dir and launch it for you, same as if you are clicking an HTML file. - Some of the panel applets such as the launcher applet, quick launch and the drawer menu along with its items allow you to add two commands per launcher. One for left-click and another one for middle-click.Multi-content Search Support in File Manager - The file manager supports searching for content inside files but it also gives you an option to search for an additional word on the same line the match is found. - To increase / decrease the icon size, along the standard CTRL + Wheel to zoom in / out, you can also click and hold the right-hand mouse button and use the scroll wheel – up/down.Double-Clicking a Blank Desktop Area Run a preset gesture or an individual command when the blank area of the desktop is clicked. Hold-Down Right-Hand Mouse Button and Double Click - Run a preset gesture or an individual commandRight now, it serves more like a desktop shell because it doesn't have a session manager and other utilities such as a power manager, screensaver, screen config etc but if I get enough motivation, I intend to develop that too.The application can run in  and  mode.To run in portable mode, make sure a file named ".portable_mode" (without the quotes) exists in  If running in , it will return the path to the folder/dir that contains all the files. if running in e, it will return  Returns the path to $BASE_DIR/shared directory. To make sure the package remains portable across live CDs and distros, save/download all yours files to the "shared" folder and then when assigning commands to launchers, do something like $SHARED_DIR/my_file To run in , make sure a file named "" (without the quotes) exists in .This desktop can be run on top of any other desktop, even GNOME, Elementary, KDE. When so, it draws its own desktop window, full screen covering the already running one. When run under iconless desktops, you will get icons (works on GNOME).Right-click the Desktop and go to "Environment & Workspace Settings" and then "Appearance" to adjust the content margins of the desktop. This is the left, top, right and bottom positions of where the icons start. It's in the "Content Margins & Spacing" section. This should be adjusted according to where the existing panels are positioned such as the GNOME menu bar or any other panels on the sides of the screen.Double-clicking the "Linux System" icon brings a "Disks & Partitions" menu. This behaviour will remain until I implement a proper and fancy "Computer" window. I have most (but not all) of the code already.Right-clicking "Linux System" brings up a menu with a set of system utilities whose paths need to be set in "Environment & Workspace Settings"->"Applications". Except for the "Device Manager" which I already have working (most of it), the rest of the utilities need implementation but as a work-around, you can enter a path to an external utility.Double-clicking the "Disks & Partitions" icon brings up a different, perhaps fancier "Disks & Partitions" menu so use the one you prefer. Right-clicking the "Disks & Partitions" icon will bring the same "Disk & Partitions" menu as the one that comes when double-clicking the "Linux System" icon.I have pre-prepared an existing "Custom Actions" menu for you to look at. Take a look at the examples, I think you will get the gist but if you don't, then just email me / ask me. "Right-click"->"Custom Actions"->"Edit Custom Actions".When holding the "Alt" key when double-clicking an icon, either on the desktop or the file manager or any of the panel applets that let you run commands, will force-run the command in a terminal window  there is a catch. This will NOT work if your window manager's accessibility key is set to "Alt". On my system, I have this accessibility key set to the Super key so it works fine. I will make this customizabe in the future.You will need to right-click the "Orbitiny" applications menu on the panel and go to "Commands" to set log out, reboot and power off commands. These will need to be matched with the ones used by the exisitng session manager.I have done it like this because I don't have a session manager yet. My next primary goal is to develop a session-manager so that you can select the DE from your display manager and run it. Right now, you can set "start-orbitiny" as a start-up application in your existing desktop environment settings and when so, it will start automatically.Wayland support, as far as I am aware, the window tasks and the systray are the only parts that don't work but it has not been tested fully. When testing, you should be testing it under the X11 display server rather than a Wayland compositor. Right now, I don't support any of the Wayland copmositors but I intend to add official Wayland support in the future.By default, middle-clicking an empty area on the desktop will bring the fancy looking "Disk & Partitions" menu. You can change this in "Environment & Workspace Settings"->"Advanced"->"Gestures"->"Middle Button Click".You can change gestures in "Environment & Workspace Settings"->"Advanced"->"Gestures"Some of the panel applets such as the launcher applet and the drawer menu along with its items allow you to add two commands per launcher. One for left-click and another one for middle-click.The code base is huge, some of it is very old and requires a re-write and some very new and I've most likely missed something and that would cause an error.Please don't get upset/disappointed if you encounter an error or something that's annoying, just let me know and I will fix it.Finally, if you are happy with what you see, please consider making a monetary donation. That would be very much appreciated and would motivate me to continue working on the project and release updates, add/improve features etc. Originally I built this DE for my personal use but I now decided to release it to the public.bce30f77bcdc42bdc9633095e4b97327Again, the code base is large and without a doubt something is broken so please report bugs / issues and I will try to fix it. Looking forward to your feedback.Something I forgot to add about the panel.In some VMs, pressing and holding keyboard keys simultaneously do not behave as expected and as such it is not an issue with this panel.Click on a panel handle or the edge button and move the bar to any of the 4 edges of the screen / monitor to dock the panel to that edge position of the screen.Click on a panel handle and then while holding CTRL, drag horizontally to resize the bar.Click on a panel handle and then while holding SHIFT, drag vertically to move the bar vertically.Click on a panel handle and then while holding ALT, drag horizontally to move the bar horizontally.Also, the Edge button at the end of the panel can act as a handle too.Click on a panel handle and then while holding CTRL, press the Up/Down keys on your keyboard to move the bar vertically by an inch at a time.Likewise, press the Left/Right keys on your keyboard to move the bar horizontally by an inch at a time.Hover over the panel and use the mouse wheel to scroll the panel Contents (when scrolling is enabled).Hover over the panel and then while holding CTRL, use the mouse wheel to resize the bar.Double clicking a panel handle will run a command. You can edit the command in Preferences.Middle clicking a panel handle will expand/collapse a panel.To copy the content of a tooltip, click the tooltip icon on the right.To stop this message from popping up, go to Preferences and uncheck "Show Drag Handles Tooltips" located in the "Other" tab.To get to Preferences, right click the panel and select Preferences from the popup menu.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lion dancers welcome the Lunar New Year in Myanmar</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GymbKSTbN4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4GymbKSTbN4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 03:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Drums, cymbals and the noise of an enthralled crowd gave a cacophonous welcome to the Lunar New Year in Myanmar’s commercial capital on Sunday.

I am informed that you're imposing a 50% import tariff on us; I do the same," the Colombian President wrote on social media.Petro's announcement came attached to a lengthy letter addressed to Trump in which he extensively criticized the United States, claiming he would "resist." Petro described Trump and other American leaders as "slaveholders" who saw Colombians as an "inferior race.""I survived torture, and I will resist you," he wrote. "Make me fall, President, and the Americas and humanity will respond."The dispute broke out after Petro denied the entry of two American aircraft carrying Colombian migrants, claiming he would only accept them once the U.S. government "establishes protocols that guarantee dignity and rights to the deportees."According to Secretary Marco Rubio, Petro had initially authorized the aircraft to land in Colombia but canceled his authorization once the airplanes were en route.Trump responded to Petro's decision by announcing tariffs of up to 50% on Colombian imports and immediate visa sanctions for people associated with the Colombian government."These measures are just the beginning," Trump wrote. "We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the criminals they forced into the United States!"According to Trump, both repatriation flights carried a "large number of illegal criminals." The Republican president also suggested Petro's denial of the flights "jeopardized the National Security and Public Safety of the United States."Petro later said he would be sending his presidential plane to pick up deportees with dignity. He also pointed out the 15,660 U.S. citizens "established in Colombia" without proper documentation, calling on them to regularize their status.While some social media users applauded Petro, claiming he was "standing up to Trump" on behalf of Latin America, others, particularly Colombians, criticized him for not thinking twice about the consequences before acting.© 2024 Latin Times.

We have monitoring set up for particular URL and we can check for non 2xx status.This chart we talk about deploys  Pod as well as  Pods. Each is separate Deployment.The issue: when  Pod fails it's liveness probe, it gets restarted by k8s. But we also need to restart  nodes, because for some reason it looks like they lose connection in such way that they don't pick up work, and only restart helps. And  in this case .  Pod first, then .Restart in case of liveness probe restarts only affected Pod. Currently, to restart workers too, I installed KEDA in cluster and created ScaleJob object to trigger deployment restart. As trigger we use kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total Prometheus query:apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1 kind: ScaledJob metadata: name: n8n-restart-job-scaler namespace: company spec: jobTargetRef: kind: Job name: n8n-worker-restart-job spec: jobTargetRef: template: spec: containers: - name: kubectl image: bitnami/kubectl:latest # imagePullPolicy: Always command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"] args: ["kubectl rollout restart deployment n8n-worker -n company"] backoffLimit: 4 pollingInterval: 15 # Check every 15 seconds (default: 30) successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1 # How many completed jobs should be kept. failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1 # How many failed jobs should be kept. triggers: - type: prometheus metadata: serverAddress: https://<DOMAIN>.com/select/0/prometheus metricName: pod_liveness_failure threshold: "1" # Triggers when any liveness failure alert is active query: increase(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{pod=~"^n8n-[^worker].*$"}[1m]) > 0 This kind of works. I mean it succesfully triggers restarts. But: - in current setup it triggers multiple restarts when there was only single liveness probe failure. This extends downtime - depending on different settings for check time, there might be a slight delay between time of event, and time of triggeringI've been thinking about more event-driven workflow. So that when event in cluster happens, I can perform matching action. but I don't know what options would be most suitable for this task.What do you suggest here? Maybe you've had such problem? How would you deal with it?if something is unclear or I didn't provide something, ask below and I'll provide more info.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Another Undersea Cable Damaged in Baltic Sea.

	Criminal investigations have started in Latvia and Sweden, and a ship has been seized as part of the probes, according to Swedish prosecutors, who did not identify the vessel. Previous incidents have been linked to Russian and Chinese ships... 

	The latest incident comes as the three Baltic states are preparing to disconnect their electricity systems from the former Soviet network in early February and integrate themselves into the continental European grid, with some fearing further potential disruption ahead of that. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have joined the EU and Nato since regaining their independence after their forced annexation by the Soviet Union, and see their switch to the European electricity system as their final integration into the west. KÄ(TM)stutis Budrys, Lithuania's foreign minister, said navigation rules in the Baltic Sea needed to be reviewed "especially when it comes to the use of anchors" and added there were now so many incidents that there was little chance they could all be accidents. 

	Repair of data cables has tended to take much less time than that for gas or electricity connections, and the Latvian state radio and television centre said it had found alternative routes for its communications.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lightning strikes British Airways plane at a Brazil airport | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlSx6ecg_io</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BlSx6ecg_io?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 01:43:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Video shot by an eyewitness shows the moment lightning strikes a plane’s tail while parked at a gate in Sao Paulo’s International Guarulhos Airport on Jan. 24.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Openhaystack: Build &apos;AirTags&apos; – track Bluetooth devices via Apple&apos;s network</title><link>https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack</link><author>thunderbong</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:11:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Residents killed trying to return to South Lebanon, officials say | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXc_qhIfJj8</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OXc_qhIfJj8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 00:05:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Israeli forces killed 22 people in south Lebanon as a deadline for their withdrawal passed and thousands of people tried to return to their homes in defiance of Israeli military orders.

 Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter... The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration. If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board. 

Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a "full U.S. board control," the person said. 

Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Colombia faces US retaliation for turning away deportation flights | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFx3QmPdjMg</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rFx3QmPdjMg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 23:55:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Trump said he will impose retaliatory measures on Colombia, including tariffs and sanctions, after it turned away two US military aircraft with migrants being deported as part of the administration's immigration crackdown.

Here’s a personal memoir, with a few lessons in taking memorable snapshots.My father was an avid amateur photographer. He loved to take pictures, he invested in expensive cameras, and I’ve plenty of vacation memories where he had one of those cameras in hand.But organizing the slides afterwards? Labeling them? No way. Pop threw the boxes of slides in big piles and said, “I’ll sort them after I retire.” And, in preparation for his retirement, he put all those slides into five huge boxes — the kind you’d use to ship vinyl records.Whereupon, three days after my father formally retired in 1988, he died in his sleep.The slides stayed with my mother. When she moved into assisted living, the boxes went into my sister’s garage. After mom died, three years ago, they came to me. The result was a huge project of scanning family slides — between 8,000 and 10,000 of them.The primary goal was to save the photos before the media deteriorated beyond hope. It was too late in some cases. I remember Pop telling me how much cheaper Ektachrome was (compared to Kodachrome), but many of those images were as ghost-like as a half-remembered dream. Memories fade even faster. Is that a photo of my second cousin Charlotte? I’ve no idea.For those who want practical lessons, herein you will find two categories:How to go about a family photo archive project (or at least how I did it) andPractical suggestions for taking photos that your family will treasure long after you’re gone.This was an oddly spiritual process. We take pictures of the moments we think are valuable or important. So, in the photos he took, I saw my father’s dreams, the things he thought were beautiful, his moments of pride. And in so doing, I gained more understanding of who my parents were. …but I’ll leave that essay to another time.I have spoken with several people who have similar family photo archives, so let me begin by describing I went about the project.Before I began, I had an inexpensive Wolverine slide scanner but I knew a manual unit would not cut it. I bought a heavy-duty slide scanner to help me process the images. It’s a Canon CanoScan 9000F. I like it, in case you’re shopping for an affordable unit; in particular, I do not loathe the built-in software, which sets it apart from other scanners I’ve used.The project, which took me about a year, became a background process. I could scan a box of slides while I was reading my daily morning e-mail, then clean up and share the images during moments of down-time (such as waiting for poky websites to load site statistics). Over a weekend I usually could get through five or six boxes of slides.Scanning a box of slides had several steps, each of which became a kind of emotional triage:I held up a slide (in front of a desk lamp) to identify it generally and decide if it was worth scanning. In other words: Do I care about this at all? Something out-of-focus easily could be thrown away. A picture of people I didn’t care about (e.g. someone my folks met on a bus tour and never spoke with again) could be dumped, too. It soon became obvious that I didn’t need to scan tourist photos; there are just-so-many pictures you need to see of the Tower of London (which looks the same today as it did in 1972 when my parents visited) or random sunsets over random mountains.If the slide looked interesting, I did a fast preview scan. For instance, if my father took three pictures “just to be sure” I could choose the best image; I could throw out the ones where my brother had his eyes closed. And I could eliminate the pictures that were inherently uninteresting, by which I mean it brought me no sense of nostalgia.By the time I scanned an image, I was pretty committed to keeping it and sharing it with my siblings. Sometimes, if an image was entertaining or meaningful, I’d share it among my friends on Facebook.From a box of 24–36 slides, I usually shared about 8 with my brother and sisters. By the end of the project, I’d shared 2,800 images with my siblings, and a few hundred on Facebook.I used iPhoto to clean up the images and sort them into a dedicated folder. While tools like PhotoShop certainly could do a better job (and were trotted out for a few special images), 98% were treated with iPhoto’s crop, straighten, and the “Enhance” button. I also added dates and locations to the images’ metadata.To share the images with my family, I uploaded photos to Flickr. Other photo sharing sites have far better user interfaces, but Flickr has two advantages: I can limit sharing to a set of people marked as friends-and-family, and viewers can comment on the images. Plus you can search images, if you’re smart enough to add tags as you go. (Do.)Towards the end I also created private Facebook groups, which let me share with cousins as well as siblings, though its search capabilities are poor. It’s been useful for sharing those videos, though, and for encouraging conversations among my relatives.For general sharing online, I created an Old Family Photos album on Facebook. iPhoto makes it easy to share to an album (though, alas, not to a private group). I’ve been astonished by how many of my family’s history touches a chord. Don’t be shy; but do keep your family’s privacy sensitivities in mind when you share.The earliest roll of slides was from my parents’ engagement party circa 1941, followed by their honeymoon snapshots in 1942. Thousands of slides record their lives all the way through the 1980s, with a Family Circle gathering held only two months before my father’s death.Inside the big boxes were two shoeboxes with a hundred 8mm video movies, which went back to the 1920s but mainly record 1950s camping trips. (iMemories did a very good job at digitizing those.)Most images are from family vacations and special occasions, rather than “daily life.” Earlier vacations (1950s and 1960s) are mostly camping trips; later pictures are from trips to Europe, particularly when money eased up after “the kids left home.”But more is visible than the campsites and Boy Scout trips. I saw a young couple’s struggles to cope with three young children (I was an afterthought); I watched their idealism diminish and exhaustion set in.I threw away many thousands of pictures. Some of them undoubtedly had meaning to my parents, but nobody alive cares about those photos. Yet I also came across special moments — and none of us need to have “been there” to appreciate them.In reviewing thousands of slides, I learned quite a bit about taking photos that capture a family’s life. Perhaps these lessons can help you, too, in considering which images to snap — on vacation or in daily life.Those “title slides” are meaningful after all. I remember rolling my eyes whenever my father would station me in front of a road sign or National Park entrance. Such pictures seemed really lame.As I reviewed the pictures, though, the title slides were priceless. In all those years, my parents went to dozens of beaches, gardens, and campsites in random mountain ranges. Other than the date on the slide (“Sep 83”) I have no way to identify which one it is. (Occasionally, there’s a scribbled note, like, “Explorer Trip” or “London.” Um, thanks, Pop.)So I was always glad when I found a photo of us kids standing next to a “Mystic Seaport” sign or “Underground tours” (always looking put-upon and sullen, because we were told to “Stand up straight! And smile — it might turn out good!”).Labels matter. Even a few words helped me know when-and-where something happened: “1955 Nova Scotia” or my grandfather’s name. One of the saddest experiences was looking at a family-gathering photo from the 50s with several people in it, and having no idea who’s in it. (Is that my great-aunt? Maybe my sister remembers? …and too often she didn’t.) If you inherit the photos, take the time to identify the people in them. Even if it’s obvious to you that the picture is of cousin Janet who died in 1943, you can’t assume that the next viewer will know.: Do take pictures that give the viewer a clue of where you are, and with whom.Kodak picture spots aren’t memorable. Destination pictures surely remind the travelers of their experience. I’m sure that that picture of the beach in Portugal would have encouraged my father to say, “Thelma, remember that night?” That’s fine, for the people who participated. I’ve taken thousands of such photos myself.But if I wasn’t there, the image brings me no nostalgia.The worst of these pictures are the touristy photos. My father took plenty of pictures of the Eiffel Tower on their trip in the 70s. But the tower doesn’t look any different today, so I didn’t bother to scan those photos. In fact, I dumped boxes without even looking at the contents, because there’s nothing in that experience that speaks to anyone but the participants.: It’s fine to take pictures that capture a moment for those who were present. But if  could have taken that photo, don’t expect anyone to care.People pictures matter the most. Especially the non-staged ones. The formal pictures of special occasions, where we kids are lined up like we’re in front of a firing squad, are not the ones that bind us.The best family photos are the ones where we’re clowning around and laughing, or where we’re doing something together, or a moment captured without the subject realizing it. The most precious are those where the family is putting up a pup tent, or using the water pump, or packing the car for a trip.In general, try to capture your family when they are actively doing something, ideally an entire process. Let it be a photo essay: “Mom making Thanksgiving dinner” or “Daddy taking the kids to the petting zoo.” Don’t choose only the “reveal” moments such as Mom presenting the turkey to the table; include a picture of her hurriedly putting on lipstick before Grandpa arrives, or the kids conked out, asleep in the back seat, on the car trip home.A few exceptions: Nobody looks attractive or interesting while he’s swimming. Few people look great sitting on a towel on the beach, wearing a bathing cap. Also don’t take pictures of people eating dinner, even at a fancy dinner. And while it’s no longer relevant, it was never a good idea to photograph exhausted travelers arriving at an airport gate.Include the photographer. I have few pictures of my father, because he was always the guy behind the camera. When he did ask someone to take a picture it was always posed, such as “Mom and Pop standing in front of the Grand Canyon.”: Photos that capture you “being there” — which means most selfies — rarely have meaning.  matters far more.Take photos of daily life. I’m stunned by the pictures my father  take. There isn’t a single photo that represents what my parents did for a living. They weren’t the type to attend company picnics, fine. But I found nothing indicating “take your daughter to work” or “Mom typing up a report” or “the building I worked in” or “the woman Mom commuted to work with for 10 years.” That would be more understandable if my parents disliked their jobs, but both of them were passionate about their careers.Take photos of people at rest. Even though I spent much of my childhood writing letters, there is only one photo of me with a pen in my hand — and that was taken by a friend at summer camp. Yet my friends and family all recall me with a book or pen within reach. My father never captured that essential part of who I was.Some of the absences may reflect their superstitions. There are zero photos of any woman who is visibly pregnant. Maybe that was considered bad luck; I don’t know.: Don’t limit photo-taking to special occasions.Take at least a short class in photography basics. Or read a basic book on the topic. As much as my father loved photography, he never got any kind of formal training. I spend a lot of editing time cropping images to take advantage of the simplest rule-of-thirds, for instance.Even if you aren’t devoted to photography that much: Crop photos closely. My father took a lot of photos of “Mom in front of a pretty vista” but in the long run I care more about Mom’s expression than the expanse of mountains in the background. Thanks to iPhoto I can zoom in, but a lot of detail is lost.: Take the best quality photos you can. Your grandchildren will appreciate it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Biometrics, Windmills, and VHS tapes: The Winners of &apos;Rest of World&apos; International Tech Photo Contest</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/26/231212/biometrics-windmills-and-vhs-tapes-the-winners-of-rest-of-world-international-tech-photo-contest?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 23:04:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since launching in 2020, the nonprofit site RestofWorld.org has been covering tech news from 100 countries. And they've just announced the winners in their 2024 international photography contest. 

"From Cape Verde to Bhutan, we received 227 entries from over 45 countries around the world, featuring everything from sprawling mines to biometric facial scans."

Like last year, the majority of the entries in our 2024 photography contest captured on-the-ground realities of how technology is transforming lives in every corner of the world. We received submissions from over 45 countries, showcasing a stunning variety of perspectives on the intersection of technology and daily life. 

Beyond striking visuals, the photographs tell us stories of how tech plays a role in local communities, from iris-scanning payment systems inside refugee camps to EV battery-powered music gatherings. The 227 entries we received from contestants — including from Mongolia, the Philippines, Argentina, and Jordan — not only celebrate these stories but reaffirm our commitment at Rest of World to challenge stereotypes about how people use technology in their daily lives. 

An "honorable mention" photo shows immigrants from Africa arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa after a perilous boat journey. ("Upon their arrival, these refugees borrowed a smartphone from a bystander and started a video call to let their relatives know they survived the journey.") And the top photo shows a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent using a cellphone to collect facial scans from migrants entering the country from Mexico. ("After they make the crossing into the U.S., migrants are subjected to further data collection, including DNA samples.") 

Biometric data collection was a recurring theme. A photo from Jordan shows a Syrian boy paying for groceries with an iris scanner at a supermarket "run jointly by the World Food Programme and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees." Eye-scanning technology is being used there "to ensure people use only their own credit and not borrowed or stolen cards. After having their iris scanned, Syrian refugees living in the camp can make use of services such as health care and shopping, using just their eyes." 

Another recurring theme was energy. There's a lovely "honorable mention" photo from the Philippines showing two young people on a beach playing basketball "under the towering blades of the windmills in Bangu... Renewable energy has transformed this community, cutting household expenses and powering opportunities once thought to be out of reach." The third-place photo shows six children in a distant tent in "a mountainous, subarctic forest" in Mongolia" — all gathered around a laptop "to watch a documentary about a Norwegian reindeer herder" who had visited their region. ("Modern technology such as solar panels, car batteries, and the occasional Wi-Fi connection allows these families to stay connected with the world.") One photo shows a young boy carrying a solar panel down from the roof in a remote village in Jharkhand, India. 

Another photo documents the largest salt flat in Argentina, part of the so-called "lithium triangle" with parts of Chile and Bolivia. A salt miner says "They started looking for lithium there in 2010. We made them stop; it was hurting the environment and affecting the water. But now they are back and I am afraid. Everything we have could be lost." 

And a photo from Nigeria shows two people wearing traditional African attire but adorned with "goggles crafted from repurposed VHS tapes".

As polls close there, election authorities are already reporting that Lukashenko has captured 87-point-6 percent of the vote. Lukashenko - who has close ties to Moscow -  has now been in power since 1994. Election observers say the vote was largely orchestrated - rigged - and that any meaningful opponents are in prison or exiled.

But it was "hit from behind by a speeding car that was going about 98 miles per hour," a local news site reports, citing comments from Waymo. ("Two other victims were taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. A dog also died in the crash, according to the San Francisco Fire Department.") 

Waymo's self-driving car "is not being blamed," notes NBC Bay Area. Instead the Waymo car was one of six vehicles "struck when a fast-moving vehicle slammed into a line of cars stopped at a traffic light..."


 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires self-driving car companies, like Waymo, to report each time their vehicles are involved in an accident, regardless of whether the autonomous vehicle was at fault. According to NHTSA, which began collecting such data in July 2021, Waymo's driverless vehicles have been involved in about 30 different collisions resulting in some type of injury. Waymo, however, has noted that nearly all those crashes, like Sunday's collision, were the fault of other cars driven by humans. While NHTSA's crash data doesn't note whether self-driving vehicles may have been to blame, Waymo has previously noted that it only expects to pay out insurance liability claims for two previous collisions involving its driverless vehicles that resulted in injuries. 


In December, Waymo touted the findings of its latest safety analysis, which determined its fleet of driverless cars continue to outperform human drivers across major safety metrics. The report, authored by Waymo and its partners at the Swiss Reinsurance Company, reviewed insurance claim data to explore how often human drivers and autonomous vehicles are found to be liable in car collisions. According to the study, Waymo's self-driving vehicles faced about 90% fewer insurance claims relating to property damage and bodily injuries compared to human drivers... The company's fleet of autonomous vehicles have traveled more than 33 million miles and have provided more than five million rides across San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin... 

In California, there are more than 30 companies currently permitted by the DMV to test driverless cars on the open road. While most are still required to have safety drivers sitting in the front seat who can take over when needed, Waymo remains the only fleet of robotaxis in California to move past the state's testing phase to, now, regularly offer paid rides to passengers. 

Their article adds that while Sunday's collision marks the first fatal crash involving a driverless car, "it was nearly seven years ago when another autonomous vehicle was involved in a deadly collision with a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, though that self-driving car had a human safety driver behind the wheel. The accident, which occurred in March 2018, involved an autonomous car from Uber, which sold off its self-driving division two years later to a competitor." 

In other news, an unoccupied Waymo vehicle was attacked by a mob in Los Angeles last night, according to local news reports. "Video footage of the incident appears to show the vehicle being stripped of its door, windows shattered, and its Jaguar emblems removed. The license plate was also damaged, and the extent of the vandalism required the vehicle to be towed from the scene." 
The Los Angeles Times reminds its readers that "Last year, a crowd in San Francisco's Chinatown surrounded a Waymo car, vandalized it and then set it ablaze..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ARCTIC Freezer 4U-M Cooler For Ampere Altra 4U Servers/Workstations</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/arctic-freezer-4u-m-ampere</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 21:46:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For those looking for a heatsink fan to cool a custom build of an Ampere Altra / Altra Max server or workstation, the ARCTIC Freezer 4U-M ends up being a very potent option that offers similar performance to more expensive Ampere Altra heatsinks while providing similar performance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spacecoin and the Space Business</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/spacecoin-and-the-space-business?source=rss</link><author>M-Marvin Ken</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 21:40:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Spacecoin has launched its first satellite into space and the spacecoin token could be used to pay for internet and mobile payments.

Trump called the Gaza Strip a "demolition site" and that ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the enclave could be a temporary or a long-term arrangement. President Trump said he had spoken to Jordanian King Abdullah about Jordan taking in Palestinians, and that he would speak to Egyptian President el-Sissi on Sunday for Egypt to do the same. Trump's "clean out" remarks have stirred controversy, as any forced expulsion of Palestinians would violate international law and jeopardize the creation of a Palestinian state.

After years of coding in more "conventional" languages (started with Java 7, then moved to JS/TS, Python, Dart…), I thought I was ready for anything. But Rust? It’s a whole different ball game! Between memory management, the heap, the stack, borrowing, ownership, and all these concepts that feel out of the ordinary, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. This is my second attempt to dive into it seriously, and I have to say, it’s not as "friendly" as what I’m used to.Do any seasoned Rustaceans have tips to help me keep my head above water?

Or it can cause headaches, consume tons of time and budget, and yield zero results. Here are five reasons why you might not need a corporate blog after all.Running a blog takes a lot of time. A corporate blog with content published several times a week requires at least one dedicated editor-content manager-coordinator who chases everyone down and pushes them to share material. And let’s face it—nobody wants to share material; they simply don’t have the time for an additional task.\
Unlike one-off projects, a blog demands constant attention and regular updates. Employees who hold valuable information would need to dedicate 2 to 5 hours to a single piece of content (gathering information, searching for project data, getting approvals). If you’re not ready to invest that kind of work time from your key staff, don’t bother starting a blog. Haphazard and unpredictable blogging won’t yield results.Reason 2: No Way to Measure EffectivenessTo determine whether a blog meets its objectives, you need to clearly define goals and the metrics to track.\
An in-depth analysis of each published post will reveal whether the topic resonates with readers, whether the content and format engage them, and whether it ultimately drives purchases. This means tracking metrics such as:Scroll depth (how many people view the entire post),Completion rates (how many readers carefully read the post to the end),Bounce rates (visitors who leave within 10–15 seconds),Audience loyalty (positive comments or shares).\
These metrics collectively indicate the strength of the connection between the reader and the blog (and, by extension, the brand).\n If you don’t have analytics in place, clear goals, or someone to monitor these, don’t even start.Reason 3: Nobody Can WriteFinding an experienced copywriter who writes well and understands business is a real challenge. If they can also analyze performance and handle edits without frustration, they’re a rare gem.\
Such rare gems often burn out, change jobs, or demand higher pay. Then you’re back to square one. And if the blog goes dormant while you search for replacements, it’s better not to start at all.Reason 4: No Understanding of Your Target AudienceWithout clear answers to the questions, “Why will people read this?” and “What problems should the blog solve?” it’s impossible to create relevant, engaging content that keeps readers coming back.\
If you’re starting a corporate blog “just because” or “because the competition has one,” don’t bother.Reason 5: Lack of Unique ContentA good blog needs to feel "alive," with content that sparks interest and doesn’t give the impression that everyone is writing about the same thing.\
Of course, most topics you could address have already been covered on various platforms. Absolute originality in every post is tough to achieve, but you can find your unique approach.\
By the way, content uniqueness is a top priority for search engines too. So, this factor will also affect your blog’s ability to attract traffic.Tip 1: Treat Your Blog as a Platform for ExperimentsInstead of the traditional content strategy focused on SEO and promoting products and services, use the blog as a space for testing hypotheses. Each post can be more than just an article—it can be an experiment to test new ideas.\
Some businesses may focus on publishing lead-generating materials, while others may use the blog to share knowledge and experiences.Tip 2: Think of the Blog as a Dynamic Product, Not a Static ResourceInstead of treating the blog as a digital library that’s periodically updated, transform it into a dynamic resource. Content can take the form of micro-stories, reports, or emotional testimonials (yes, you know what we’re hinting at).\
Title: Step 3: How We’re Improving Customer Service — A Live Update\
“We often talk about the importance of customer service, but this time, we decided to show you the updates in real-time. Today, we’re launching a new feature: an interactive chat for quick assistance. Initial feedback has already prompted changes—yesterday we received 35 messages, 8 of which included suggestions we’ve started implementing on the fly. Stay tuned—next week, we’ll share where these first steps take us. We’d love your thoughts and ideas; after all, this is our project together.”Tip 3: A Blog Can Serve Both External and Internal AudiencesA blog is a platform for building brand awareness—not just among customers, but also internally to strengthen corporate connections.Involvement in creating blog content can act as a reward or non-monetary motivation: employees who write articles on behalf of the company position themselves as experts and develop their personal brands. In such cases, employees are likely to take the initiative themselves, and content from motivated authors is always more engaging and lively.\
A blog can also attract potential hires. Use the platform to talk about life at the company, growth opportunities through "success stories" told in the first person, and the advantages of working in a professional team. Let the blog work for both sales and employer branding.Tip 4: Use the Blog as a Feedback Tool, Not Just for PromotionMake it a space for open dialogue with your audience. Use the blog to discuss challenges, share mistakes, and gather ideas from readers. This approach fosters two-way communication.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Best Way to Collect Traces for Tempo</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iaq420/best_way_to_collect_traces_for_tempo/</link><author>/u/Sule2626</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:56:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm currently using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki in my stack, and I'm planning to integrate Tempo for distributed tracing.

If your users can't leave, and if you face no consequences for making them miserable (not solely their departure to a competitor, but also fines, criminal charges, worker revolts, and guerrilla warfare with interoperators), then you have the means, motive and opportunity to turn your service into a giant pile of shit... Every economy is forever a-crawl with parasites and monsters like these, but they don't get to burrow into the system and colonize it until policymakers create rips they can pass through. 

Doctorow argues that "more and more critics are coming to understand that lock-in is the root of the problem, and that anti-lock-in measures like interoperability can address it."

Even more important than market discipline is government discipline, in the form of regulation. If Zuckerberg feared fines for privacy violations, or moderation failures, or illegal anticompetitive mergers, or fraudulent advertising systems that rip off publishers and advertisers, or other forms of fraud (like the "pivot to video"), he would treat his users better. But Facebook's rise to power took place during the second half of the neoliberal era, when the last shreds of regulatory muscle that survived the Reagan revolution were being devoured... But it's worse than that, because Zuckerberg and other tech monopolists figured out how to harness "IP" law to get the government to shut down third-party technology that might help users resist enshittification... [Doctorow says this is "why companies are so desperate to get you to use their apps rather than the open web"] IP law is why you can't make an alternative client that blocks algorithmic recommendations. IP law is why you can't leave Facebook for a new service and run a scraper that imports your waiting Facebook messages into a different inbox. IP law is why you can't scrape Facebook to catalog the paid political disinformation the company allows on the platform...
 
But then Doctorow argues that "Legacy social media is at a turning point," citing as "a credible threat" new systems built on open standards like Mastodon (built on Activitypub) and Bluesky (built on Atproto):

I believe strongly in improving the Fediverse, and I believe in adding the long-overdue federation to Bluesky. That's because my goal isn't the success of the Fediverse — it's the defeat of enshtitification. My answer to "why spend money fixing Bluesky?" is "why leave 20 million people at risk of enshittification when we could not only make them safe, but also create the toolchain to allow many, many organizations to operate a whole federation of Bluesky servers?" If you care about a better internet — and not just the Fediverse — then you should share this goal, too... Mastodon has one feature that Bluesky sorely lacks — the federation that imposes antienshittificatory discipline on companies and offers an enshittification fire-exit for users if the discipline fails. It's long past time that someone copied that feature over to Bluesky. 
Doctorow argues that federated and "federatable" social media "disciplines enshittifiers" by freeing social media's captive audiences. 
"Any user can go to any server at any time and stay in touch with everyone else."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump discusses continued desire for Greenland aboard Air Force One</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0-rm-0K7Q</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9v0-rm-0K7Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:37:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his interest in Greenland on Saturday and told reporters on Air Force One that it "would be a very unfriendly act" if Denmark didn't allow that to happen.

"We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States."Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a late-Sunday statement that the "Government of Colombia has agreed to all of President Trump's terms, including the unrestricted acceptance of all illegal aliens from Colombia returned from the United States, including on U.S. military aircraft, without limitation or delay."Leavitt said the tariff orders will be "held in reserve, and not signed," but Trump would maintain visa restrictions on Colombian officials and enhanced customs inspections of goods from the country, "until the first planeload of Colombian deportees is successfully returned."In a statement late on Sunday, Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said: "We have overcome the impasse with the U.S. government."U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced he was authorizing the visa restrictions on Colombian government officials and their families "who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations."They were being imposed on top of the State Department's move to suspend the processing of visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia's capital, Bogota.'U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals'The U.S. president declared illegal immigration a national emergency and imposed a sweeping crackdown since taking office on Monday, directing the U.S. military to help with border security, issuing a broad ban on asylum and taking steps to restrict citizenship for children born on U.S. soil.Colombia's Petro condemned the U.S. practice of repatriation using military aircraft, suggesting it treated migrants like criminals. In a post on social media platform X, he said Colombia would welcome home deported migrants on civilian planes."The U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals," he wrote.WATCH | Trump's promised immigration raids, deportations underway:Petro said even though there were 15,660 Americans without legal immigration status in Colombia, he would never carry out a raid to return handcuffed Americans to the U.S."We are the opposite of the Nazis," he wrote.Mexico also refused a request last week to let a U.S. military aircraft land with migrants.Trump did not take similar action against Mexico, its largest trading partner, but has said he was thinking about imposing 25 per cent duties on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 over illegal immigrants and fentanyl crossing into the U.S.The U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner, largely due to a 2006 free-trade agreement, with $33.8 billion US worth of two-way trade in 2023 and a rare $1.6 billion US trade surplus, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.The biggest U.S. imports from Colombia that year were crude oil, gold, coffee and cut roses.Petro's comments add to the growing chorus of discontent in Latin America as Trump's week-old administration starts mobilizing for mass deportations.Brazil's Foreign Affairs Ministry late on Saturday condemned "degrading treatment" of Brazilians after migrants were handcuffed on a commercial deportation flight. Upon arrival, some of the passengers also reported mistreatment during the flight, according to local news reports.The plane, which was carrying 88 Brazilian passengers, 16 U.S. security agents and eight crew members, had been originally scheduled to arrive in the city of Belo Horizonte, in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais.However, at an unscheduled stop due to technical problems in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas, Brazilian officials ordered the removal of the handcuffs, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva designated a Brazilian Air Force flight to complete their journey, the government said in a statement on Saturday.WATCH | Deportation flights spark tariffs threats between U.S. and Colombia:The commercial charter flight was the second this year from the U.S. carrying undocumented migrants deported back to Brazil and the first since Trump's inauguration, according to Brazil's federal police.Officials from the U.S. State Department, Pentagon, U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately reply to requests for comment.The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon's response to Trump's national emergency declaration on immigration issued on Monday.In the past, U.S. military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, such as during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Silicon Valley Is In the Midst of an Ideological Battle That Nobody is Talking About</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/silicon-valley-is-in-the-midst-of-an-ideological-battle-that-nobody-is-talking-about?source=rss</link><author>Juan C.

Not the kind with missiles and tanks, but one that will determine whether your children grow up in a world of digital freedom or algorithmic chains. \
The stakes couldn't be higher, and the battle lines couldn't be clearer.\
On one side stand the  - the Ross Ulbrichts, the Edward Snowdens, the Julian Assanges. Men who sacrificed everything to expose the truth, who chose principles over profit, liberty over comfort. These aren't your typical tech bros with their kombucha taps and meditation pods. These are digital warriors who looked at the machine and said: "No more."\
On the other, tech's  - the Bill Gates and George Soros types who preach about saving humanity while building the very systems that enslave it. They fly private jets to climate summits. They build walls around their homes while advocating for open borders. They talk about misinformation while spreading their own narratives through bought-and-paid-for media outlets.The Battle Lines Are DrawnIn 2021, Mark Zuckerberg was the perfect example of Silicon Valley's postmodern puppet - a hoodie-wearing technocrat who bent to every government censorship demand. Each congressional hearing brought a new apology, each media outcry a new algorithm tweak. The pattern was clear: bow, scrape, repeat.\
Fast forward to his recent Joe Rogan appearance: a muscled, jiu-jitsu trained CEO talking about personal sovereignty and free speech. The transformation wasn't just physical - it was philosophical. The old Zuck would have dodged and weaved. The new one speaks about freedom with the clarity of someone who's finally woken up.\
The pendulum of history swung back. Hard.\
When Elon Musk took over Twitter (now X), he didn't just buy a social media platform - he sparked a revolution. Community notes replaced fact-checkers. Open algorithms replaced shadow bans. \
Suddenly, the tech elite had to choose: stand for freedom or cling to control. There was no middle ground left.It's no coincidence that tech's freedom fighters share an intellectual lineage. From Ross Ulbricht's love of Austrian economics to Elon Musk's embrace of first principles thinking, there's a direct line to thinkers who championed individual liberty over collective control. \
These aren't just random beliefs - they're part of a coherent philosophical framework that values human agency over central planning.Meanwhile, the Coward Class drew their inspiration from a different well - the postmodern philosophers who taught them that truth is relative and control is compassion. \
The same ideological subversion that gave us safe spaces and trigger warnings gave us content moderation and algorithmic suppression. It's no accident that the biggest advocates of censorship also tend to be the biggest fans of critical theory.Then there are the fence-sitters like Zuckerberg. Once the poster child for tech censorship, he's now pivoting Meta toward free speech principles. Is this genuine reform or just another survival adaptation? The jury's still out.\
But here's what's clear: we're entering what philosopher Ken Wilber calls the "integral age" - a synthesis that transcends both traditional conservatism and postmodern relativism. This isn't about going backward. It's about going forward with clear eyes.\
The old categories don't work anymore. We're not returning to some mythical past - we're creating something new. Something that combines the best of traditional values with modern innovation and postmodern critique.There's a reason Zuckerberg's transformation included getting physically stronger. Silicon Valley's postmodern era wasn't just ideologically weak - it was physically soft. Compare the soy-faced grins of tech's social justice warriors with the determined looks of its freedom fighters.\
This isn't toxic masculinity. It's the kind of masculinity that made men willing to risk everything for what they believed in. The kind that puts Ross Ulbricht in prison while others profit from far worse crimes. The kind that has Julian Assange fighting extradition while war criminals walk free.\
It's about having the courage to stand up. To say no. To risk everything for what you believe in. In an age of moral relativism and corporate compliance, that's become a revolutionary act.The Future Is Not GuaranteedAs the pendulum swings toward digital freedom, the old guard won't go quietly. They'll wrap their control systems in the language of safety, sustainability, and social responsibility. They'll try to make heroes look like villains. They'll use every trick in their postmodern playbook to maintain their grip on power.\
But here's the truth: history remembers its heroes. It forgets its cowards. And right now, in Silicon Valley, everyone's choosing which side they'll be on.\
The Great Digital Awakening isn't just another tech trend. It's a battle for the soul of the internet. And ultimately, for the future of human freedom itself.\
The choice is yours. The time is now. Which side of history will you be on?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Playwright: My First Steps With the Browser Automation Tool</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/playwright-my-first-steps-with-the-browser-automation-tool?source=rss</link><author>Nicolas Fränkel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In my previous company, I developed a batch job that tracked metrics across social media, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky, Reddit, etc. Then I realized I could duplicate it for my own "persona." The problem is that some media don't provide an HTTP API for the metrics I want. Here are the metrics I want on LinkedIn:\
I searched for a long time but found no API access for the metrics above. I scraped the metrics manually every morning for a long time and finally decided to automate this tedious task. Here's what I learned.The job is in Python, so I want to stay in the same tech stack. After a quick research, I found Playwright, a browser automation tool with a couple of language APIs, including Python. Playwright's primary use case is end-to-end testing, but it can also manage the browser outside a testing context.\
I'm using Poetry to manage dependencies. Installing Playwright is as easy as:\
At this point, Playwright is ready to use. It offers two distinct APIs, one  and one . Because of my use-case, the first flavor is more than enough.I like to approach development incrementally.\
Here's an excerpt of the API:\
It translates into the following code:from playwright.sync_api import Browser, Locator, Page, sync_playwright


with (sync_playwright() as pw):                                                        #1
    browser: Browser = pw.chromium.launch()                                            #2
    page: Page = browser.new_page()                                                    #3
    page.goto('https://www.linkedin.com/login')                                        #4
    page.locator('#username').press_sequentially(getenv('LINKEDIN_USERNAME'))          #5
    page.locator('#password').press_sequentially(getenv('LINKEDIN_PASSWORD'))          #5
    page.locator('button[type=submit]').press('Enter')                                 #6
    page.goto('https://www.linkedin.com/dashboard/')                                   #4
    metrics_container: Locator = page.locator('.pcd-analytic-view-items-container')
    metrics: List[Locator] = metrics_container.locator('p.text-body-large-bold').all() #7
    impressions = atoi(metrics[0].inner_text())                                        #8
    # Get other metrics
    browser.close()                                                                    #9
Launch a browser instance. Multiple browser types are available; I chose Chromium on a whim. Note that you should have installed the specific browser previously, , playwright install --with-deps chromium.\
By default, the browser opens ; it doesn't show up. I'd advise running it visibly at the beginning for easier debugging: .Open a new browser window.Navigate to a new location.Locate specified input fields and fill them in with my credentials.Locate the specified button and press it.Locate  specified elements.Get the inner text of the first element.Close the browser to clean up.The above worked as expected. The only downside is that I received an email from LinkedIn every time I ran the script:\
  You've successfully activated Remember me on a new device . Learn more on how Remember me works on a device.\
I also met Fabien Vauchelles at the JavaCro conference. He specializes in web scraping and told me that most people in this field leverage browser profiles. Indeed, if you log in to LinkedIn, you'll get an authentication token stored as cookies, and you won't need to authenticate it again before it expires. Fortunately, Playwright offers such a feature with its launch_persistent_context method.\
We can replace the above  with the following:with sync_playwright() as pw:
    playwright_profile_dir = f'{Path.home()}/.social-metrics/playwright-profile'
    context: BrowserContext = pw.chromium.launch_persistent_context(playwright_profile_dir) #1
    try:                                                                               #2
        page: Page = context.new_page()                                                #3
        page.goto('https://www.linkedin.com/dashboard/')                               #4
        if 'session_redirect' in page.url:                                             #4
            page.locator('#username').press_sequentially(getenv('LINKEDIN_USERNAME'))
            page.locator('#password').press_sequentially(getenv('LINKEDIN_PASSWORD'))
            page.locator('button[type=submit]').press('Enter')
            page.goto('https://www.linkedin.com/dashboard/')
        metrics_container: Locator = page.locator('.pcd-analytic-view-items-container')
        # Same as in the previous snippet
    except Exception as e:                                                             #2
        logger.error(f'Could not fetch metrics: {e}')
    finally:                                                                           #5
        context.close()
Playwright will store the profile in the specified folder and reuse it across runs.Improve exception handling.The  can also open pages.We try to navigate to the dashboard. LinkedIn will redirect us to the login page if we are not authenticated; we can then authenticate.Close the context whatever the outcome.At this point, we need only to authenticate with both credentials the first time. On subsequent runs, it depends.I was surprised to see that the code above didn't work reliably. It worked on the first run and sometimes on subsequent ones. Because I'm storing the browser profile across runs, when I need to authenticate, LinkedIn only asks for the password, not the login! Because the code tries to enter the login, it fails in this case. The fix is pretty straightforward:username_field = page.locator('#username')
if username_field.is_visible():
    username_field.press_sequentially(getenv('LINKEDIN_USERNAME'))
page.locator('#password').press_sequentially(getenv('LINKEDIN_PASSWORD'))
Though I'm no expert in Python, I managed to achieve what I wanted with Playwright. I preferred to use the sync API because it makes the code slightly easier to reason about, and I don't have any performance requirements. I only used the basic features offered by Playwright. Playwright allows recording videos in the context of tests, which is very useful when a test fails during the execution of a CI pipeline.Originally published on A Java Geek on January 19th, 2024]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Reid Hoffman feels optimistic about our AI future</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/why-reid-hoffman-feels-optimistic-about-our-ai-future/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 18:54:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Reid Hoffman’s new book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right With Our AI Future, the LinkedIn co-founder makes the case that AI can extend human agency — giving us more knowledge, better jobs, and improved lives — rather than reducing it.

But several factors contributed to its rapid spread, the fire district's chief told the Los Angeles Times:
A fire suppression system that is part of every battery rack at the plant failed and led to a chain reaction of batteries catching on fire, he said at a news conference last week. Then, a broken camera system in the plant and superheated gases made it challenging for firefighters to intervene. Once the fire began spreading, firefighters were not able to use water, because doing so can trigger a violent chemical reaction in lithium-ion batteries, potentially causing more to ignite or explode. 
The county's Board of Supervisors has now requested that the plant remain offline until an investigation is completed. A county supervisor told the newspaper "What we're doing with this technology is way ahead of government regulations and ahead of the industry's ability to control it." 

And plans for a new battery storage site nearby are now being questioned, with an online petition to halt all new battery-storage facilities in the county drawing over 3,200 signatures.

The fire earlier this month was the fourth at Moss Landing since 2019, and the third at buildings owned by Texas-based Vistra Energy... Already, the fire has prompted calls for additional safety regulations around battery storage, and more local control over where storage sites are located... 
California Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay) has introduced Assembly Bill 303 — the Battery Energy Safety & Accountability Act — which would require local engagement in the permitting process for battery or energy storage facilities, and establish a buffer to keep such sites a set distance away from sensitive areas like schools, hospitals and natural habitats... Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fierce advocate of clean energy, agrees an investigation is needed to determine the fire's cause and supports taking steps to make Moss Landing and similar facilities safer, his spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said in a statement. Addis and two other state legislators sent a letter to the California Public Utilities Commission Thursday requesting an investigation. 

"The Moss Landing facility has represented a pivotal piece of our state's energy future, however this disastrous fire has undermined the public's trust in utility scale lithium-ion battery energy storage systems," states the letter. "If we are to ensure California moves its climate and energy goals forward, we must demonstrate a steadfast commitment to safety..." 

initial testing from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ruled that the levels of toxic gases released by the batteries, including hydrogen fluoride, did not pose a threat to public health during the fire. [The EPA says their monitoring "showed concentrations of particulate matter to be consistent with the air quality index throughout the Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay regions, with no measurements exceeding the moderate air quality level... In addition to EPA's monitoring, Vistra Energy brought in a third-party environmental consultant with air monitoring expertise, right after the fire started"] 

Still, many residents remain on edge about potential long-term impacts on the nearby communities of Watsonville, Castroville, Salinas and the ecologically sensitive Elkhorn Slough estuary.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lukashenko wins ‘sham’ election in Belarus with 87.6 percent of vote</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/alexander-lukashenko-wins-sham-election-in-belarus/</link><author>/u/Antique-Entrance-229</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 18:31:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“Maybe we would consider doing it again. … Maybe we would have to clean it up a little bit,” Trump tells a rally in Las Vegas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Has the behaviour of maxUnavailable and maxSurge for RollingUpdates changed since v1.21.9</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1iam71l/has_the_behaviour_of_maxunavailable_and_maxsurge/</link><author>/u/mrnadaara</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 18:31:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've deployed a new cluster with v1.30.7 and tried to deploy a deployment with a maxSurge of 1 and maxUnavailable with 0.

By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

The cable linked the Latvian town of Ventspils with Sweden's Gotland island."We have determined that there is most likely external damage and that it is significant," Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina told reporters following an extraordinary government meeting."We are working together with our Swedish Allies and NATO on investigating the incident, including to patrolling the area, as well as inspecting the vessels that were in the area," Silina wrote later on X, adding that the cable was damaged in Sweden's exclusive economic zone.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his country is working closely with Latvia and NATO. "Sweden will contribute important capabilities to the ongoing effort to investigate the suspected incident," he wrote on X. The cable is believed to be severely damaged."Given that the cable lies at a depth exceeding 50 meters (164 feet), the exact nature of the damage can only be determined once cable repair work begins," LVRTC said in a statement.LVRTC stated that it continues to provide services via alternative data transmission routes. "Currently, there may be delays in data transmission speeds, but for the most part this does not impact end users in Latvia," the center said.NATO moves to protect Baltic sea cablesNATO takes action in the Baltic SeaNATO said last week it was launching a security mission called "Baltic Sentry" in which it would deploy frigates, patrol aircraft and naval drones in the Baltic Sea to help protect critical infrastructure.

However, the answer reveals layers of complexity intertwined with history, science, and the foundations of modern computing. Let’s dive deep to understand how humanity has measured time and how it connects to JavaScript’s timekeeping.The Early Days of Timekeeping​Time measurement began with observing natural periodic phenomena. Early civilizations looked to the moon's phases and the apparent movement of the sun to divide time into manageable units. These observations gave rise to the concepts of days, months, and years.As human needs evolved, a more granular division of time became necessary. The ancient Egyptians and Babylonians divided the day into 24 hours, likely influenced by their base-12 numbering system. Later, hours were divided into 60 minutes and minutes into 60 seconds, creating the framework we still use today.While these early methods sufficed for centuries, they lacked precision. By the mid-20th century, advancements in technology demanded a more accurate measurement of time. The invention of the atomic clock in the 1950s marked a revolutionary step. These clocks measure time based on the vibrations of cesium atoms, offering unparalleled precision.As a result, the definition of a second was updated to:"The duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom."This definition formed the foundation for what we now call international atomic time (TAI)Universal Time is based on the Earth's rotation. It’s intuitive and tied to our everyday experience of day and night. However, the Earth's rotation is not perfectly consistent due to various factors such as gravitational interactions and geophysical processes. As a result, we could say that Universal Time is imprecise and variable.Atomic Time, derived from atomic clocks, is based on physical phenomena and is both precise and consistent. It serves as the backbone for modern timekeeping systems.In the 1970s, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) was introduced to reconcile the discrepancies between Universal Time and Atomic Time. UTC aligns with Universal Time but incorporates adjustments, such as the addition or removal of leap seconds, to compensate for the Earth's irregular rotation.Leap seconds are occasional one-second adjustments added to UTC to keep it in sync with Universal Time. These adjustments ensure that UTC remains within 0.9 seconds of Universal Time. However, they introduce complications for systems that rely on precise time calculations.Here’s the improved article in English, incorporating the original tables:ECMAScript and POSIX Time​This approach treats every day as having exactly  (24 hours), ignoring both leap seconds and astronomical variations in the Earth's rotation. While this simplifies calculations and suffices for most applications, it introduces limitations in scenarios where precise timekeeping is critical.Although POSIX and UTC appear similar, . Here are the key differences:UTC includes leap seconds to adjust official time to the Earth's rotation.POSIX does not count leap seconds, meaning that POSIX days always have 86,400 seconds, even when UTC days have 86,401 or 86,399 seconds due to a leap second.Simplified Interoperability:POSIX assumes all seconds are of equal duration. This makes calculating time differences straightforward but causes discrepancies when leap seconds occur.For example, during a leap second (e.g., ), POSIX simply ignores the additional second, making timestamps near the leap second ambiguous or inaccurate.Step Adjustment: The Traditional Solution​Historically, systems that needed to account for leap seconds would use a technique called . This method can be described as just ignoring the leap second, causing the clock to jump forward or backward by one second at the exact moment of the leap second.Lets see a table to understand this:As you can see from the both TAI and UTC are strictly increasing, but POSIX (step) has a jump in time at the leap second. This means that 2 different UTC seconds are mapped to the same POSIX second. This can cause issues in some applications. The biggest problem is that some apps can go "back in time" when a leap second is added.Lets say that a payment is requested at , and approved during the next second at . Our logs will show something like:This is a problem because the payment was approved before it was requested. This is why most system use a different approach to handle leap seconds.Smearing: The Practical Solution​In many modern systems implementing POSIX time, a technique called  is used to handle leap seconds. Instead of adding or removing a whole second, the effects of the leap second are distributed gradually over a longer period (typically 24 hours). This has several implications: First of all during the smear period, seconds are slightly longer or shorter than a standard second (measured in atomic time). This ensures a smooth transition instead of an abrupt jump in time. On the other hand compared to stepping the clock is strictly increasing, which is a requirement for many applications.Example: Smearing and Step Adjustment Tables​In this table:  ignores the leap second entirely, treating  as if it doesn't exist while  gradually adjusts the clock, ensuring smoother transitions but at the cost of seconds having slightly different durations.This is how Google's NTP servers handle leap seconds. They smear the leap second over a 24-hour period, ensuring that the clock is always strictly increasing. More information can be found here.Implications for Applications​Why It Usually Doesn’t Matter​For tasks like scheduling events, calculating ages, or displaying time in user-facing applications, JavaScript (and POSIX) time is precise enough and 99% of the problem will be derived from timezones.For applications requiring high precision, such as those in scientific research or financial systems, the discrepancies caused by leap seconds and smearing can lead to significant errors. Accurate timekeeping is crucial to ensure the reliability and accuracy of measurements and transactions. During a leap second, a single POSIX timestamp can refer to two different moments in UTC, creating ambiguities and potential errors in systems that demand precise time synchronization.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Michigan Law Requires High Schools to Offer CS Classes</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/01/26/1547204/new-michigan-law-requires-high-schools-to-offer-cs-classes?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 17:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The state of Michigan will now require each public high school in the state to offer at least one computer science course to its students.

Before you get too excited, the techniques used to reduce compilation
          time are not applicable to all Rust projects. However, I expect the
          learnings to be useful for any Rust developer who wants to improve
          their project's compilation time. Now that this is clarified, let's
          dive into the results.

We started with a compilation time of 108 seconds for the matmul
          benchmarks, which was reduced to only 1 second after all the
          optimizations. The most effective optimization was the element-type
          generics swap, where we instantiated generic functions with predefined
          "faked" element types to reduce the amount of LLVM code generated. The second optimization also had a major impact, further
          reducing the compilation time by nearly 3×. This was achieved by using
          our comptime system instead of associated const generics to represent the
          matmul instruction sizes. Finally, the last optimization—also the simplest—was
          to reduce the LLVM optimization level to zero, which is particularly useful
          for debug builds, such as tests.

Compilation times are measured using incremental compilation.

First, let me explain the situation that led me to investigate our
          compile time. During the last iteration of CubeCL, we refactored our matrix multiplication GPU kernel to work with
          many different configurations and element types. CubeCL is a dialect
          that lets you program GPUs for high-performance computing applications
          directly in Rust. The project supports multiple compiler backends,
          namely WebGPU, CUDA, ROCm, and Vulkan with more to come.

The refactoring of the matrix multiplication kernel was done to
          improve tensor cores utilization across many different precisions. In
          fact, each kernel instance works across 3 different element types: the
          global memory element type, the staging element type, and the
          accumulation element type. These are all different since we normally
          want to accumulate in a higher precision element type, as this is
          where numerical approximation is most sensitive. Also, the tensor
          cores don't work across all input precisions; if you have f32 inputs,
          you need to convert those to tf32 element types (staging) to call the
          tensor cores instructions. To add to the complexity, tensor cores
          instructions only work across fixed matrix shapes that also depend on
          the precisions. For instance, f16 staging matrices work across all
          shapes from (32, 8, 16), (16, 16, 16), (8, 32, 16). But tf32 only
          works on (16, 16, 8).

In our first refactoring, we represented the shape of the matrices
          supported by the instructions using const associated types, since this
          is the abstraction component that makes the most sense in this case.
          For the element types, we naturally used generic arguments for traits
          and functions - pretty much what any developer would do in this
          scenario. However, with all the possible combinations, we ended up
          with a compilation time of 1m48s using the cache.

Yes, you read that right: 1m48s just to rebuild the matmul benchmark
          if we change anything in the bench file.

For the purpose of this optimization, we only consider incremental
          compilation using cargo caching, since this is the most important one
          to speed up dev iteration time. Changing one configuration to test if
          an optimization worked took almost 2 minutes just to create the binary
          to execute a few matmuls.

Well, we need to understand that the Rust compiler is actually very
          fast. The slow parts are the linking and LLVM. The best way to improve
          compilation time is to reduce the amount of LLVM IR generated.

In our specific case, each combination of the matmul would generate a
          whole new function - this is what zero-cost abstraction means. There
          is no dynamic dispatch; every type change duplicates the code to
          improve performance at the cost of a bigger binary. Before all of our
          optimizations, the binary generated was 29M, and after we reduced it
          to 2.5M - a huge difference.

To reduce the amount of code generated, we had to use different Rust
          techniques to make our abstractions for the matmul components. In our
          case, we don't need zero-cost abstractions, since the code written in
          Rust for the matmul components actually generates the code that is
          used to compile at runtime a kernel that will be executed on the GPU.
          Only the GPU code needs to be fast; the JIT Rust code takes almost no
          time during runtime. Zero-cost abstraction would actually be optimal
          in a setting where we would perform ahead-of-time compilation of
          kernels.

Ever wonder why LibTorch or
          cuBLAS have executables that are
          GIGABYTES in size? Well, it's because all kernels for all precisions with
          all edge cases must be compiled to speed up runtime execution. This is
          necessary in a compute-heavy workload like deep learning.

However, CubeCL is different - it performs JIT compilation, therefore
          we don't need to compile all possible variations ahead of time before
          creating the binary: we can use dynamic abstractions instead! This is
          one of the two optimizations that we made for the matmul components.
          Instead of relying on const associated types, we leveraged the
          comptime system to dynamically have access to the instruction sizes
          during the compilation of a kernel at runtime. This is actually the
          second optimization that we made and helped us go from 14s compilation
          time to around 5s.

However, the biggest optimization was quite hard to pull off and is
          linked to the generic element types passed in each function. We still
          wanted to use zero-cost abstraction in this case, since passing around
          an enum listing what element type operations are on would be terrible
          in terms of developer experience. However, the hint to improve our
          compilation time was that when you write a function that will execute
          on the GPU, we have an attribute on top .

We want the code to look and feel like normal Rust, but the macro
          actually parses the Rust code written and generates another function,
          which we normally call the expand function, where the actual GPU IR is
          built for the function. That code will actually run during runtime,
          not the code that the user is writing. The element types generics are
          only used to convert the generic element type into the enum IR element
          type. In the expand functions, we also pass a context where all IR is
          tracked.

So the optimization was to pass a fake generic element type, called  instead of the actual element type like . When
          compiling a kernel, we first register the real element type in the
          context, using the const generic item to differentiate multiple
          element types if a function has multiple generic element types. Since
          we always call the expand function with the exact same generic items
          for all element types, we only generate one instance of that function,
          and the element types are fetched at runtime using the context.

The most tedious part was actually implementing that optimization
          while trying not to break our components. The biggest problem caused
          by that optimization is that we can't support generic dependencies
          between traits over the element type in launch functions of CubeCL.

It makes sense though - we don't want to recompile all the instruction
          types for all different precisions. Since our optimization is
          activated at the boundaries of CPU code and GPU code, where cube
          functions are identified as launchable, we need the generic trait to
          not have a dependency on the element type. They are going to be
          switched by our macro. We use generic associated types instead of
          traits with generic element types.

This is known as the family pattern, where a trait is describing a family of types.

Using this pattern, we can inject the family type at the boundaries of
          CPU and GPU code and instantiate the inner instruction type with the
          expand element type.

Migrating most of the components to the new pattern, we reduced
          compile time from 1m48s to about 14s.

It was a lot of work, and I don't expect all projects to face cases
          like this, but it was worth it! Now waiting for about 5 seconds after
          trying something in the code to see if performance is improved doesn't
          break the flow, but almost 2 minutes did.

We essentially leveraged the fact that CubeCL is a JIT compiler and
          not an AOT compiler, which is very appropriate for throughput-focused
          high-performance applications.
Playing with LLVM optimization settings
Since our benchmarks are compiled with optimization level set to 3, we
          could still improve the compilation time further to about 1s by
          reducing the optimization level to zero. Another 5X speedup that we
          can have by simply adjusting the LLVM optimization level.

We decided not to keep that optimization in production, since we want
          the benchmarks to have the same LLVM optimization level as user
          applications. However, we activated it for testing, since we often
          rerun tests to ensure we don't break correctness when implementing or
          optimizing kernels.
Not a Rust Compiler Issue
All of our optimizations actually created tons of code - we used proc
          macros, associated type generics, const generics, and tons of complex
          features from the Rust type system.

The Rust compiler is actually very fast; the slow part is really the
          linking and optimizing of the LLVM IR. If there's one thing to take
          from this post, it's that you shouldn't worry about using complex
          features of Rust, but make sure you don't generate huge binaries.
          Reducing the binary size will improve compile time even if you use
          complex methods to do so! "Less code compiles faster" is not exactly
          right. "Less generated code compiles faster" is what we have to keep
          in mind!

Simultaneously, regulatory frameworks impose critical boundaries. Governments worldwide are scrambling to set rules that ensure ethical AI use, addressing concerns around data privacy and algorithmic transparency. In retail, this means balancing innovation with compliance—a tightrope act that requires vigilance and adaptability.\
Competition further intensifies the urgency. With heavyweights like Amazon or Alibaba aggressively leveraging AI, others must keep pace or risk obsolescence. These giants use AI to enhance logistics, customer service, and inventory management, setting a high bar for industry standards.\
Layered over these factors is the global economic climate, influencing investment capacities and technological advancements. As economic conditions fluctuate, resource allocation toward AI projects can wax and wane, impacting the pace and scale of integration.In this intricate web, retailers must skillfully navigate macro influences to effectively integrate AI, ensuring they remain competitive, compliant, and consumer-centric in today's market.Socio-Technical Systems Theory: A New LensThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the  is intricately challenging, intertwining technology's mechanical precision with the unpredictability of human behavior. This delicate balance is where socio-technical systems theory offers considerable insights. By perceiving AI implementation through both technical and social lenses, retailers can better navigate this complex landscape.\
Technical elements might focus on hardware, software, and data frameworks vital for AI deployment. However, the real magic, and often the most daunting challenges, lie within the social dimension. Employees, for instance, may feel threatened by AI-enhanced tools fearing job redundancy, or overwhelmed by the intricacies of new systems. Sociotechnical systems theory suggests that successful AI integration is dependent not only on the robustness of these technological components but also on addressing the human aspects involved in this transition.\
In practical terms, this could mean actively involving frontline employees in AI training programs or creating open forums to express concerns and suggestions about the technology. Retailers might observe more cohesive adoption by reconfiguring team structures to foster collaboration between tech-savvy staff and those with domain expertise, ensuring that AI solutions are informed by practical, day-to-day retail operations. Ultimately, treating AI integration as a socio-technical challenge moves the organization beyond mere installation, toward holistic adoption that respects the human elements intertwined with technological advancements.Leavitt’s Diamond Model in AI ImplementationLeavitt's Diamond Model offers a structured way to dissect the complexities of  by focusing on four core dimensions: structure, technology, tasks, and people. This model is instrumental because it forces us to consider how these elements interact and impact each other when AI disrupts retail operations.\
Let's start with structure. Retailers must assess their organizational frameworks to see how AI tools fit or demand adjustments. It might mean redefining roles or creating new departments that focus on AI oversight, ensuring the chain of command is equipped to handle AI-driven insights.\
On the technology front, AI isn't just another digital tool—it's transformative. For successful integration, retailers must ensure their existing tech infrastructure is compatible with AI systems. This often involves upgrading legacy systems, which can be costly and time-consuming but crucial for seamless operations.The people element is perhaps the most sensitive. Employees must be trained and reassured about AI's role. This involves communication strategies to mitigate fear of job loss and highlight AI's potential to improve job satisfaction through automation of mundane tasks.\
Considering these dimensions using  allows retailers to foresee potential bottlenecks and align AI integration with their strategic objectives, creating a smoother transition into AI-driven retail ecosystems.Case Studies of Successful AI IntegrationRetailers who master AI integration often leverage the AI Implementation Compass to guide them through the intricacies of this technological transition. Successful narratives emerge from companies like Walmart and Stitch Fix, offering a blueprint for others to follow. At Walmart, harnessing AI to optimize supply chain operations has minimized stock discrepancies and improved inventory management. This technological shift wasn't abrupt; it involved a coherent strategy that aligned technological upgrades with task redefinitions and staff training, a move inspired by components of  from the previous section.\
In contrast, Stitch Fix has redefined customer engagement through . By deploying complex algorithms to understand consumer preferences, they revolutionized their task structures to align with new technological capabilities. This adaptation not only enhanced customer satisfaction but also reshaped their workforce, creating roles geared towards data analysis and algorithm training.\

The noise, the billions, the global “hunters” with their “trained pigs and dogs” (startups and VC funds)—it all makes you wonder: Is this another well-crafted strategy by those who invest first and shape our perception? Because, just like with truffles, victory isn’t just about innovation; it’s about how you spin the story.\
At DeHealth we keep pushing forward on our super-app, focusing on AI in healthcare—one of the critical sectors where AI can (and must) deliver real benefits, from rapid diagnostics to robust patient data protection.Instead of an aggressive expansion, we only see a few big names. SAP is one of the few European corporations making a strong appearance (and sure Mistral  and Photoroom). Those are the kinds of stories that truly reshape global perception.AI and Hope in Stormy TimesAt “AI House Davos,” there’s a phrase on the wall:“Lern im Missgeschicke hoffen, denk des Sturms bei heiterer Zeit” \n “Learn to hope in despair, remember the storm when the weather is fair.”\
What if we apply this motto not just to tech but to the world at large? In healthcare, AI is shaking up everything—from remote monitoring to genomics-level diagnostics 🧬. Maybe this is the “storm” we need to prepare for in advance. The same goes for cybersecurity: before it turns into a worldwide “epidemic,” we must build collective defenses.We should all ask ourselves: Is this another beautiful myth being sold to us, or is it our real chance to shape the future? Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in the middle, as usual. As a cyber-war expert, I always try to think critically and fact-check. Let me know your thoughts in the comments —I’d love to hear your opinion. One fact stands firm: if we want to be in the game, we must learn to tell our story right—Europe included.In the end, whether we’re selling the future of medicine, groundbreaking tech, or rare delicacies, it all boils down to one question: What legend are we creating? 💡]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From India to Germany - Creating a new world with good food | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG4z76ynr98</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fG4z76ynr98?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 17:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Running a restaurant as an Indian woman? Almost unthinkable in India. But Prateek Reen does it -- in Munich. This film shows the journey of a young woman from an Indian mountain village to Bavaria.

She will never forget how poor her family once was, after they lost everything in a fire. She has experienced the world as fleeting and fragile. But Prateek Reen also knows that you can take a recipe with you, on a small piece of paper. A memory. The taste of freedom. And that you can use it to create a new world in a foreign country. In Germany, she did just that, with her own restaurant, called "Madam Chutney”.

We overreact, hurry, and let our biases get in the way of good decision-making. We assume given the conditions and constraints under which we are operating, this is the best we can do.\
However, our best, most of the time, is not good enough because we blame it on our circumstances and fail to learn from our mistakes instead of taking responsibility for our actions.\
This creates a vicious cycle of stress and anxiety every time we are faced with a difficult situation—negative emotions from past failures, fear of not meeting expectations again, and not knowing how to make a better decision this time leading to bad choices with terrible results.\
The ability to make good decisions under stress is highly valued because it’s rare to see it in action. It’s a super skill that gets your attention, makes you stand out, and builds credibility at work.Let us not become victims of a crippling reasoning pattern. If we want to improve our decision-making and critical thinking, we must recognize our mental biases and be willing to overcome them. Let us avoid creating arguments to confirm pre-existing beliefs at all costs and invest in a ‘sunk cost fallacy.’\
Use these five steps to make the best possible decision under difficult conditions:When you are running against time or the situation demands that you move fast, you may start panicking. That panic not only reflects in your tone of voice and body language but even the way you think.\
We don’t have an entire day.\
Hurrying, especially when the circumstances are not in your favor or the situation appears out of control leads to poor choices and bad decisions.\
Slowing down may seem counterintuitive in such moments, but that’s exactly what you need to do. Pausing and taking a deep breath clears the mental fog required to make good decisions. It lowers stress and anxiety that clouds your thinking and compromises your judgment.Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\
Ask these questions when you feel the need to hurry into a decision:What am I feeling right now?Is my decision driven by a rational thought process, or am I reacting impulsively to strong emotions of fear, stress, or anxiety?In what ways can external pressures influence my choice?What would happen if I took more time to decide?Have I considered all possible alternatives? What might I be overlooking?What are my priorities in this situation and how does my decision align with those priorities?\
Don’t lead with the first thought that comes to mind. Slow down. Use the pause to reflect on choices, clarify your understanding, and validate your assumptions.The biggest mistake we make when making decisions under tough situations is assuming we need to have all the answers. Not knowing something hurts our ego. Coming up with the decision all by ourselves then becomes a matter of pride and self-esteem.\
We don’t ask questions, seek alternative perspectives, or invite disagreements because doing so undermines our authority and judgment.\
But good decisions aren’t made in silos or by relying on the knowledge and experience of one person. Utilizing the collective wisdom of the group helps us overcome our biases and explore options that we would otherwise not consider.Questioning helps people gain perspective and understand the perspectives of others. As they see issues and problems from different points of view, they gain an appreciation for their complexity—and also expand the range of possible solutions.\
Make more informed and thoughtful decisions by asking the right questions:How do others feel about different options?What other alternatives have we not yet considered?What potential risks do others see with each choice?What could go wrong? What could go right? How likely are these outcomes?If others were to pick one option, which one would they choose and why?\
The art of decision-making requires the art of questioning. Make better decisions under the worst circumstances by finding the right answers, not trying to be right.Consider Second-Order EffectsWhile making decisions, how often do we optimize for long-term gain at the cost of short-term pain? A good process for making decisions requires second-order thinking which unravels the implications of our decisions by thinking about its consequences in the future.\
It’s tempting to give in to good outcomes with small upsides that are easily accessible and visible to us without weighing in on the potentially large downside of these decisions in the future.\
Our experiences and beliefs also limit our ability to go beyond the natural and seek hard truths by asking difficult questions, exploring unknown territories, and doubting what may seem like an obvious choice.Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored.\
Second-order thinking as a mental model requires going out of our comfort zone and stepping into the unknown. It requires analyzing the potential impact of our decision in the future by asking these questions:How can I make decisions with positive outcomes compounded in the future?Is this decision attractive only because it has an immediate effect (first-order consequence) positive?What can be the potential downside of this decision and its effect later?\
Going beyond intuition and seeking unconventional solutions by applying second-order thinking philosophy is what separates great thinkers from the ordinary who outperform others and achieve greater success.The science of behavioral economics tells us that once we have made a decision, even an illogical one, we tend to cling to it. We believe a certain line of thinking is right, and filter out dissenting information while seeking information that confirms our original point of view. \
Psychologists call this confirmation bias.\
This bias is so deeply seated in our unconscious thinking that even our illogical reasoning sounds entirely rational to us. We operate with a biased filtered worldview missing critical pieces of information and stamp it with “logic-based reasoning.”\
Another bias that impacts decision-making is relying solely on our instincts.\
In his classic , Daniel Kahneman, a psychologist and economist notable for his work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making stresses on the fact that our gut instinct can fail us when we apply familiar patterns of experience to unrelated circumstances or situations.\
We make quick decisions based on our past experience which is a key source of noise and bias. He asks us to resist premature intuition and says “Intuition should not be banned, but it should be informed, disciplined, and delayed.”\
To catch yourself, ask these questions:Am I relying solely on my intuition to make this decision? What data supports my thinking?How am I sure this data is not biased?What other dissenting pieces of information have I considered?What do others have to say about this decision?\
Combine your intuitive reasoning with scientific knowledge and data. Ask others for disconfirming opinions and pieces of evidence to enable you to see both sides of the argument and not only the one that appeals to you.Apply the Five Whys TechniqueFinally, you can’t improve your decision-making skills without implementing a feedback loop in your process.\
Despite your best efforts, not all decisions will turn out right—unexpected situations, wrong assumptions, and lack of complete information may lead to undesired results with other negative consequences.\
The experience is nothing but emotionally draining and can leave you in a state of denial—attaching superficial causes for not getting the desired results or speeding through analysis without any significant conclusions.\
Shift from obvious and superficial reasons to the underlying root cause. Dig in, draw connections, identify and learn from your past, ask questions, and only accept an answer that clarifies what you did wrong and what action could have prevented the mistake from happening:Why did you make the mistake?Was the mistake avoidable or unavoidable?What does this mistake teach you about yourself?\
A powerful technique to go from a superficial understanding of your mistake to the underlying root cause is to use the “five whys” technique designed by Sakichi Toyoda who used it within the Toyota Motor Corporation during the evolution of its manufacturing methodologies.\
Ask why the mistake occurred and use the answer as the premise for the next question repeating this whole process five times to dig deeper into the actual cause of the issue. By repeating “why” five times, the nature of the problem and its solution becomes clear.\
Q: Why did the fix we deployed end up breaking a downstream system that was dependent on our data?A: We changed an API contract and missed notifying the downstream system of the change.A: We were not aware that their team was using this API contract.\
Q: Why were we not aware of them using our API?A: We maintain a document listing all dependent downstream systems and contracts. This service was not listed in the document.\
Q: Why was this service not part of the document?A: This service recently went live and the document was not updated to include it. So, we missed notifying them.\
Q: Why was the document not updated?A: We don’t have a process in place to ensure such changes are captured. Relying on manual processes is faulty.\
This example clearly demonstrates that the actual problem is quite different from the answer to the first question.\
Without digging deeper, we might stop at the first answer that comes to our mind—hardly the answer we need to solve the problem and prevent it from occurring again. \
Five  is a general guideline. You can stop at three or go all the way till seven ; whatever gets you the answer you need to understand your mistake better.Five Whys is a powerful organizational technique. Coupled with working in small batches, it provides the foundation a company needs to respond quickly to problems as they appear, without overinvesting or overengineering.\
Becoming a good decision-maker requires turning every mistake into a learning lesson—show curiosity to understand what you’re doing wrong and what you can do to improve.Learning to make good decisions, especially when circumstances are not in your favor, is a skill that can help you get others' attention and make you stand out at work.Speeding through a decision may appear right when faced with a time crunch, but hurrying only leads to decisions that you may regret in the long run. Slowing down and pausing, even for a brief moment, can create the space necessary to think clearly and make more objective decisions.When tasked with a decision, you may refuse to ask questions with the worry that not knowing something may hurt your reputation and damage your credibility. Not asking questions limits your perspective which makes you more prone to bad decisions. Good decision-making involves finding the right answers, not knowing all the answers by yourself.Instant gratification feels good which makes you more likely to choose an option with short term rewards without fully understanding the impact of your decision in the long run. Don’t make a decision without considering its future implications. The best decision is the one with positive results compounded in the future.Confirmation bias combined with faulty intuition is a deadly combination. It makes you reject evidence that contradicts your opinion and double down on the choice that matches your intuition. Intuition is valuable, but intuition without logical reasoning can lead to biased decisions.Learning to make good decisions isn’t a one-time process. It involves a lifetime of learning, experience, and practice. When your decision doesn’t work out as expected, use the five-whys technique to dig deeper into the root cause, and use the knowledge to prevent such mistakes from happening again.\

Wayland Cursor Lag: Just give me a break already...,
where a Linux user discusses their frustration with input latency under Wayland.
They detailed their own subjective experience of the problem,
but failed to produce hard evidence.Even though I'm a very happy user of wayland overall,
I share the blog post's author's subjective impression that there's more
cursor lag under Wayland than under X11.
In my opinion, their experiment was limited by their phone camera's 90 FPS,
which really doesn't feel like it's enough to get conclusive numbers
when we're talking about differences which are probably on the order of
single screen refresh cycles.So I thought: hey, I have a phone with a 240 FPS camera mode,
I bet that's enough to get some conclusive results!I simply pointed my phone's camera at the screen and desk using my left hand,
made sure to get the mouse cursor, the mouse and my right hand in frame,
and recorded myself repeatedly flicking the mouse with my finger.
I recorded myself flicking it 16 times under Wayland,
logged out of the GNOME Wayland session and into a GNOME X11 session,
then did the same there.I then converted the two resulting video files into a series of JPEGs
using ffmpeg (ffmpeg -i <input file> %04d.jpg),
and counted from the first frame where I could see the mouse move
until the first frame where I could clearly see that the cursor had moved.I elected to include the start and end frame;
so if I saw the mouse move in frame 1045,
then I saw the cursor move in frame 1047,
I would count that as 3 frames.Here's an example which depicts a latency of 3 frames (requires JavaScript):Here's a frame from before the mouse has begun moving.The mouse still hasn't moved.Here, the mouse has just about started moving,
so I consider this "frame 1".
The cursor hasn't moved yet.The mouse moves a bit further, but the cursor still hasn't moved.
This is "frame 2".This is the frame where the cursor starts moving.
This is "frame 3", so I would note down this sequence
as taking 3 frames.Distro: Fedora Workstation 41GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7900XTMonitor: Gigabyte M32U (4k IPS @ 144.99, no DPI scaling)Mouse: Logitech G502 LightspeedCamera: iPhone 15 Pro, slo-mo 240 FPSThe main limitations of this experiment are:240 FPS still isn't  much. With my 144Hz screen, I have less than
two camera frames per screen refresh. This introduces some random variance.Pixels don't switch instantly, so there are ambiguous frames where the cursor
is  starting to become visible in its new location.
I decided to count the cursor as "having moved" when there is a clearly visible
cursor in a new location on the screen, even if the pixels haven't fully lit up.For some reason, the video recording from my phone contains some duplicate frames.
I don't know why this happens. I decided to interpret these duplicate frames
as a representation of a frame's worth of time passing, so I counted them as normal.All these factors introduce some uncertainty in the results.
However, they  affect Wayland and X11 equally, so with enough data,
it should all even out. Another caveat I should clearly point out is that there are
many other Wayland compositors out there than GNOME's, and I have not tested them.
For that matter, there are other GPU drivers out there than AMD's.
Other compositors and other GPU drivers may show different results.Here's the data I captured:Wayland, on average, has roughly 6.5ms more cursor latency than X11 on my system.
I don't have the statistics expertise necessary to properly analyze
whether this difference is statistically significant or not,
but to my untrained eye, it looks like there's a clear and consistent difference.Interestingly, the difference is very close to 1 full screen refresh.
I don't know whether or not that's a coincidence.Here are the numbers in chart form:In my mind, these results are conclusive proof that there  a difference
in input latency between X11 and Wayland, at least with my hardware,
and that the difference is large enough that it's plausible for some people to notice.Further testing on more varied hardware and refresh rates is necessary
to get a clear picture of how wide-spread the problem is and how large it is.
It's likely that the magnitude of the difference varies based on factors
such as which compositor is used and what the refresh rate of the screen is.I probably won't undertake that further testing,
because this is all very time intensive work.
My goal was only to see if I could conclusively measure  difference. I want to add a note here about what this testing does  show.
It does not show that there's higher input latency 
in Wayland compared to X11 in a way which affects, for example, games.
It is possible that this added latency is entirely cursor-specific
and that Wayland and X11 exhibit the exact same input latency
in graphical applications and games.
It is my understanding that the cursor is handled very differently from
normal graphical applications.
Further testing would be necessary to show whether Wayland has more input latency
 than X11.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hard numbers in the Wayland vs X11 input latency discussion</title><link>https://mort.coffee/home/wayland-input-latency/</link><author>/u/mort96</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:44:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, I read this blog post:

Wikipedia defines ACPI as "an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:

The ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could "spectacularly" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... 

Rafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: 

 "The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values." 
One 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took "a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected." In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Microsoft 365 Copilot launch was a disaster</title><link>https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/the-microsoft-365-copilot-launch-was-a-total-disaster/</link><author>belter</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:33:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You'd think that Microsoft's marketing team would have learned something after last year's shambolic rollout of the Recall feature. Maybe, before trying another rollout, they might talk to a few customers, do some focus groups, even ask a few members of the press and analyst community for their advice.Shortly after the New Year, someone in Redmond pushed a button that raised the price of its popular (84 million paid subscribers worldwide!) Microsoft 365 product. You know, the one that used to be called Microsoft Office? Yeah, well, now the app is called Microsoft 365 Copilot, and you're going to be paying at least 30% more for that subscription starting with your next bill.Microsoft 365 gets a new logo, a new name, and a higher price.As far as I can tell, the response from customers has been overwhelmingly negative. I monitor Microsoft-focused online forums obsessively, and I read hundreds of complaints without seeing a single compliment. Seriously, the reaction to this rollout was an Excel #DIV/0 error.What went wrong? Where do I begin?They botched the price increaseLet me bend over backward to Microsoft here. They launched Office 365 (which later became Microsoft 365) more than a dozen years ago, and in that time they have not raised the price once. In case you haven't noticed, we are living through some inflationary times right now.So, there was plenty of room for Microsoft to roll out a gentle price increase. "Hey y'all, we know this isn't welcome news but we need to bump up the Microsoft 365 subscription price by two bucks a month. It's still a great deal!"Netflix does that every year or two and no one shows up at Netflix HQ with pitchforks and torches.No one wants to pay for AIThere's a ton of potential in AI, and it has some solid use cases today, for tasks like writing code and finding patterns in large databases.But in the places where Microsoft 365 Family and Personal subscribers are likely to see AI, the edges are still very, very rough. If you ask Copilot in Word to write something for you, the results will be about what you'd expect from an enthusiastic summer intern. You might fare better if you ask Copilot to turn a folder full of photos into a PowerPoint presentation. But is that task really such a challenge?To top that off, there are similarly rough edges in the way the Copilot features are implemented. For example, I have both work and family subscriptions to Microsoft 365. This combination normally works very well; I can sign in with one account, attach resources like OneDrive from both accounts, and work with almost no friction.But good luck doing the same with Copilot features. In that configuration, I consistently get error messages telling me, "As a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscriber, you'll be able to use Copilot when you're signed with your Microsoft work or school account (Entra ID) and Microsoft personal account. However, that ability is not yet available."If you pay for a personal and work subscription to Microsoft 365, you'll pay the higher price but won't get the new features.Let me see if I understand this: I'm paying Microsoft for not one but two subscriptions, and they raised the price of one of those subscriptions while not allowing me to use its signature feature. That seems like a lousy way to reward your best customers.The announcement was bungled, tooI pay annually for my Microsoft 365 Family subscription. The price went up more than a week ago, but I haven't received an email telling me about it. As the account manager, I should see that notice before I see the new price in my dashboard.Instead, I learned about the new price thanks to a pop-up message on my Android phone.This po-up on my phone is the only notice I've received about a price change. That notice tells me I have a monthly plan. No, I have an annual plan that will renew in a month or two. It says I can cancel billing in my Play Store settings. No, I can't. I bought this subscription using the web browser on my Windows PC, and when I tap the Subscriptions button in the Android app it opens a web browser and takes me to my Microsoft account page, where I have to tap the Manage button to find the cancel option.Oh, and I've lost count of the number of people who were baffled and angry that Microsoft had forcibly installed the Copilot app on their devices. It was just a rebranding of the old Microsoft 365 app with the new name and logo, but in my case it was days later before I received yet another pop-up message telling me about the change.Well, surely you can just turn it off. Right?The smartest thing Microsoft could have done was to make this initial release of Copilot an opt-in feature for a few months. They could have said, "We're excited to let everyone try this! Just click OK here!"Instead, they turned the feature on for everyone and gave Word users a well-hidden checkbox that reads Enable Copilot. The feature is on by default, so you have to clear the checkbox to make it go away.As for the other Office apps? "Uh, we'll get around to giving you a button to turn it off next month. Maybe."Seriously, the support page that explains where you can find that box in Word says, "We're working on adding the Enable Copilot checkbox to Excel, OneNote, and PowerPoint on Windows devices and to Excel and PowerPoint on Mac devices. That is tentatively scheduled to happen in February 2025." Until the Enable Copilot button is available, you can't disable Copilot.Meanwhile, maybe think twice about using the option to disable all of the connected features in your Office apps. As one writer pointed out (with multiple swear words and some threats aimed in the general direction of One Microsoft Way), doing so can have unintended consequences, like making it appear as though all your files in OneDrive have suddenly disappeared.How long will the Classic option last?If you try to cancel Microsoft 365 to avoid the price increase (or just to say no to the AI features), Microsoft's subscription  management page offers the option to downgrade to a Classic plan, which turns out to be exactly what you signed up for not that long ago, minus the price increase.That's purely a retention play, of course. New subscribers can't sign up for this plan, and I expect that it will be discontinued in a year or two. Why is Microsoft doing this?I have yet to see a single person praising the implementation of Copilot in Microsoft 365 or telling Satya Nadella they've gotten their money's worth out of this unexpected upgrade.So, why do it at all? I can think of 3 billion reasons. I could plug the numbers into Excel and tell you about it, but let's have Copilot explain instead.Microsoft Copilot understands how the subscription business model works.Microsoft is halfway through its 2026 fiscal year. It's almost like someone was given instructions at the end of the calendar year to bump up that revenue line for the Office Consumer division.Here's the funny thing: The price increase is so big that there will still be a huge positive impact even if 10% of Microsoft 365 Personal and Family customers cancel rather than pay the extra monthly fee. Copilot walked me through the math and concluded, "So, even with 10% of your customers canceling their subscriptions, you would still generate an additional $1.714 billion annually due to the price hike. How do you feel about this adjustment?"I feel like I understand why all those complaints are going to go unheard.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU rejects election in Belarus and threatens new sanctions</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/eu-rejects-election-belarus-threatens-155127173.html</link><author>/u/Snowfish52</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:20:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union rejected the election in Belarus on Sunday as illegitimate and threatened new sanctions.Belarus held an orchestrated vote virtually guaranteed to give 70-year-old autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko yet another term on top of his three decades in power.“Today’s sham election in Belarus has been neither free, nor fair,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos said in a joint statement.“The relentless and unprecedented repression of human rights, restrictions to political participation and access to independent media in Belarus, have deprived the electoral process of any legitimacy," Kallas and Kos said.They urged the Belarusian government to release political prisoners, estimating their number at more than 1,000, including an employee of the EU delegation in Belarus' capital, Minsk.Kallas and Kos said that the decision to invite observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe only 10 days ago prevented the group from monitoring the full electoral process.“For these reasons, as well as the involvement of the Belarusian regime in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and its hybrid attacks against its neighbours, the EU will continue imposing restrictive and targeted measures” against the Belarusian government, the EU officials said.They didn't elaborate on what eventual new sanctions would target, or provide a time frame.Kallas and some EU foreign ministers are expected to meet Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Sunday night in Brussels for an informal, closed-door dinner.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How We Studied the Effects of Different Exoskeleton Controllers on Gait Patterns</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-we-studied-the-effects-of-different-exoskeleton-controllers-on-gait-patterns?source=rss</link><author>Exoself Technology Research</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:15:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Mohammad Shushtari, Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo (smshushtari@uwaterloo.ca);(2) Julia Foellmer, Mechanics and Ocean Engineering Department, Hamburg University of Technology (julia.foellmer@tuhh.de);(3) Sanjay Krishna Gouda, Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (KITE), University Health Network (arash.arami@uwaterloo.ca).NSERC Discovery under Grant RGPIN-2018-4850, the Tri-Agency Institutional Programs Secretariat (TIPS): New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF)–Exploration under Grants 2018-1698, 2022-620, John R.

\
Fig. A1A illustrates the modifications made to the hip reference trajectory (∆rhip) during the MBTC block. These modifications occur after the HTC block and before the TBC block, as depicted in (Fig. 10), across ultra-slow, slow, and moderate walking speeds. Similarly, Fig. A1B showcases the adaptation of the Fourier coefficients (θ) and their convergence pattern during the MBTC block at ultra-slow walking. The Fourier coefficients begin to adapt as soon as that block starts. It takes approximately 20 seconds for them to converge, and they subsequently exhibit minor oscillations around their converged values until the treadmill speed is switched to the slow speed. This change in treadmill speed induces new walking conditions, resulting in distinct gait patterns. Consequently, the Fourier coefficients converge toward a new set of steadystate values. A similar pattern emerges when the treadmill is switched to the moderate speed. Pearson correlation between the vertical Ground Reaction Forces during each of the HTC, MBTC, and TBC blocks and natural walking with no exoskeleton is plotted for each stride in Fig. A1C. According to the graph, the GRF patterns resemble the GRF in natural walking at slow and moderate walking speeds. In ultra-slow speed, however, the correlation slightly decreases in all three blocks. Finally, Fig. A1D shows the computed stride length. As expected, in all three blocks, the stride length increases with the increase in treadmill speed.To identify which controller led to a gait closer to natural walking, we analyzed the spatiotemporal parameters of gait (obtained using GaitUp Sensors) in TBC, HTC, and AMTC and compared them to those of each participant’s natural walking with no exoskeleton. Moreover, we analyzed the correlation of recorded ground reaction torques in the case of each controller with natural walking.B.1 Gait Spatiotemporal Parameters\
\
Fig. B2A shows the maximum heel clearance in natural walking condition (with no exoskeleton) and during exoskeleton walking at each of the TBC, HTC, and AMTC blocks at ultra-slow, slow, and moderate speeds. Natural walking has the greatest heel clearance, which is expected as the addition of the exoskeleton weight makes it harder for the participant to lift their foot to their convenient level. Among the three controllers, AMTC has a heel clearance closer to that of natural walking, indicating that maintaining the desired heel clearance is easier for the participant in the case of this controller. Similarly, Fig. B2B compares the minimum toe clearance, showing that at all walking speeds, natural walking with no exoskeleton has the lowest minimum toe clearance. The HTC controller demonstrates lower toe clearance than the TBC and AMTC at all speeds. However, these differences are not statistically significant unless during moderate walking, where the HTC has led to a 21.3%±18.2 and 12.2%±9.3 decrease in minimum toe clearance compared to the AMTC and TBC, respectively (Friedman: p <0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank: pHT C,AMT C <0.007, pHT C,T BC <0.003).\
Regarding the stance percentage, as depicted in Fig. B2C, AMTC exhibits the closest behavior to natural walking at all speeds. In all cases, TBC has a smaller stance percentage compared to natural walking. During ultra-slow and slow-speed walking, HTC has the smallest stance percentage. In moderate-speed walking, however, HTC has the highest stance percentage. Finally, Fig. B2D illustrates the stride length for each of the controllers at the three experimented walking speeds. The stride length generally increases with the increase in treadmill speed. At each individual speed, however, natural walking appears to have the smallest stride length on average, mostly compared to the TBC, which has the highest stride length (Friedman: p <0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank: p <0.01 for all speeds).B.2 Ground Reaction Force\
\
Fig. B3A shows the Pearson correlation of the vertical ground reaction force between walking with each of the controllers and natural walking without the exoskeleton. At all speeds, TBC exhibits the most different vertical GRF compared to the other controllers (Friedman: pUltra-slow <0.02, pSlow < 0.001, and pModerate < 0.016; Wilcoxon signed rank: p <0.01 for all speeds). In contrast to the TBC, HTC and AMTC led to more natural vertical GRF profiles with Pearson correlations greater than 96% at all speeds. The same observation stands for the GRFs in lateral (Fig. B3B) and longitudinal (Fig. B3C) directions, where TBC shows the least natural GRF profile while HTC and AMTC demonstrate closer to natural walking GRF with Pearson correlations greater than 82.2% and 91.5% in lateral and longitudinal directions, respectively (Friedman: p <0.003; Wilcoxon signed rank: p <0.004 for all cases).[1] Dupont, P.E., Nelson, B.J., Goldfarb, M., Hannaford, B., Menciassi, A., O’Malley, M.K., Simaan, N., Valdastri, P., Yang, G.-Z.: A decade retrospective of medical robotics research from 2010 to 2020.

Once, my little son asked me why people fear the dark. I told him that our brains constantly dream, even when we’re awake. When awake, this dream is in sync with the outside world we perceive (what we see, hear, etc.). When it’s dark, visual stimuli disappear, and our brains start filling the void.\
And why does it fill it with scary things? Perhaps there’s an evolutionary reason for this. If we assume there are frightening things in the dark, we become more cautious. Better safe than sorry.\
When I explained this to my son, I didn’t know that it was an existing theory with a name: the Free Energy Principle.\
According to the Free Energy Principle, our brain is fundamentally a prediction machine. Its most important function is to anticipate the future. The evolutionary reason for this is quite obvious: if you can predict a predator's attack, you can escape in time; if you can't, you die.\
Artem Kirsanov made an excellent video about the Free Energy Principle. For anyone interested in delving deeper into the topic, it’s highly recommended to watch it:According to the theory, every human brain contains an abstract model of reality (a world model) that it uses to make predictions. The brain continuously fine-tunes these predictions based on incoming stimuli from the environment, and this is how our perception of reality is constructed.\
Artem illustrates this with an example involving a tiger in his video. If we see yellow and black stripes in the distance, our brain can generate several predictions. It could be a person wearing a tiger-striped shirt, a toy tiger lost by a child, or even a real tiger. The brain, therefore, has multiple theories about how to interpret the sensory input. This "uncertainty" is referred to in the theory as free energy, and the brain's goal is to minimize this free energy—essentially reducing the chance of being surprised as much as possible.\
As more information comes in from the environment, the number of possible theories decreases. For example, if we see the tiger pattern moving, the toy tiger theory can be ruled out, leaving us with either a person or a real tiger. If we’re in a park, it’s most likely a person walking through the bushes. If we’re on a safari, however, it’s far more likely to be a real tiger.\
According to the Free Energy Principle, perceiving reality is not a passive process. The reality we experience is something we project rather than merely perceive. The perceived reality largely originates from within, while sensory input from the environment serves to fine-tune this internal concept.\
There’s an idea that has been on my mind for a long time: what would happen if we removed sensory input from the process and connected brains directly to each other?\
Imagine four people lying in isolation tanks, completely shutting out all external stimuli. Their brains are connected via advanced BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) systems. It’s far from certain that this could ever be achieved, and it’s obviously not trivial from a technological standpoint, but let’s entertain the thought experiment.\
At the moment of connection, without any external stimuli, the state would likely be quite chaotic (with a very high level of free energy). However, since each brain would be working to reduce this free energy, an equilibrium state would eventually be reached, and the four brains would synchronize. What would it feel like to experience this equilibrium state?\
We have experienced what it’s like when our brain generates "reality" without sensory input based on its world model. This happens when we dream. But what would it be like if four people were to dream the same dream simultaneously?\
Since four brains would be working simultaneously to minimize surprises (reduce free energy), this shared dream would likely feel much more real than traditional dreams—perhaps so real that it would be entirely indistinguishable from external reality.\
When we think about fully immersive virtual reality, we often assume it will require immense computational power, as simulating the physical world is an incredibly complex task. However, it’s quite possible that simply connecting people’s brains directly could be enough—the brain might handle the rest on its own.To create the true metaverse, we don’t need supercomputers capable of perfectly simulating the physical world—what we need are wires connecting brains.\
How human brains could be "wired together" is, of course, a very difficult question to answer. The most likely candidate for this would be some form of BCI (Brain-Computer Interface), such as Neuralink, where electrodes detect neural activity and stimulate neurons. Other possibilities include magnetic field-activated nanoparticles or light (I wrote an entire article on this topic a few years ago), but something entirely unconventional could also emerge—for instance, direct biological connections using specialized fungi.\
Imagine if people spent the majority of their lives in fully immersive VR—it could drastically reduce humanity's consumption and environmental impact. In a world where resource usage is minimized and existing resources are optimally distributed, there would be no scarcity, no inequality, wars would lose their purpose, and there would be no need to exploit nature.\
For those interested in exploring this topic further, you can read a full article about it here:\
The question arises: if the fake reality created by connecting brains is completely indistinguishable from “real reality”, isn’t it possible that we’re already living in such a fake reality? Yes, yes—this brings us to the good old Simulation Hypothesis.\
Several studies have explored how we might prove if we are indeed living in a simulation. Without exception, these theories focus on identifying the limits of the computer running the simulation. They propose experiments designed to push the simulating computer into calculations it cannot perform.\
But what if there is no computer? What if the simulation runs directly on our brains? In such a case, it would be impossible to prove we are living in a simulation because no matter what experiment we conduct, we would always receive results that align with our expectations and confirm that our world is not a simulation.\
But if we are indeed living in a simulation, who created it? This is another common question related to the Simulation Hypothesis. However, there’s a very simple answer to this: perhaps we have always existed in this interconnected state, as a single mind, and the real illusion is that we are separate individuals.\
This idea is the focus of my recent article on the Thinking Universe. For those interested in exploring the topic further, I delve into this concept in detail there.\
The Free Energy Principle is a fascinating theory from the perspectives of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, the most exciting aspect is that it allows us to understand our brain’s functioning deeply enough to potentially "hack" it. Such a technology would surpass all others, as it wouldn’t just solve problems—it would enable us to create entirely new realities for ourselves where those problems don’t even exist!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: HackerNoon Decoded: The Polls that Defined 2024 (1/26/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/1-26-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:06:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, January 26, 2025?By @hackernooncontests [ 4 Min read ] Join the Spacecoin Writing Contest, today!

Heel strike events are detected using the vertical GRF, enabling the segmentation of collected data into individual strides. The recorded GRF during no exoskeleton walking is temporally normalized and averaged based on the gait phase asThe EMG data was bandpass filtered, with cutoff frequencies of 5 and 500 Hz. The signal was then full-wave rectified and its envelope was computed by applying a moving average with a window of 100 ms. Each EMG signal is normalized by its respective maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), computed for each muscle as the maximum measured contraction during walking on the treadmill (maximum across with and without the exoskeleton walking). The average muscle effort [32, 33] is computed for each muscle at each stride asThe human-exoskeleton interaction torque is estimated based on Eq. 1, given by\
The mean absolute interaction torque is then calculated for each joint as:VO2 is computed for each breath. To normalize the VO2 measurements across participants, the average VO2 during treadmill walking with no exoskeleton at each speed v is computed as:5.4.5 Human-Exoskeleton Interaction Portrait (IP) Analysis\
After normalizing ∆τ and ∆µ across participants and walking speeds, we investigate their variation with respect to each other. Fig. 1 illustrates the possible outcomes:\
• Disagreement Increase (∆τ > 0 , ∆µ > 0) This condition is associated with an increase in both the total interaction torque and the total muscular effort, indicating that switching from controller c1 to controller c2 has led to an elevation of human muscular effort. Consequently, their contribution to motion has increased. This, however, has resulted in a higher total interaction torque with the exoskeleton, implying that the applied torques by the exoskeleton are not aligned with the user’s desired motion. As a result, the user needs to exert additional effort to correct the motion while contending against the applied torques from the exoskeleton. Thus, the increased interaction indicates a lack of harmony between the user’s intentions and the assistance delivered by the exoskeleton.\
• Disagreement Decrease (∆τ < 0 , ∆µ < 0) If controller c2 demonstrates improved consistency compared to c1 with the user’s desired motion, the user will experience less resistance from the exoskeleton. This reduced discordance between the exoskeleton and the user’s intended movements results in decreased total muscular effort and overall exertion by the user. Additionally, achieving a further reduction in disagreement between the human and exoskeleton can lead to one of the two next scenarios.\
• Human Yields Control to Robot (∆τ > 0 , ∆µ < 0) With the continued reduction in human-user interaction, a user may consider relinquishing motion control to the exoskeleton. This implies that the user will no longer actively contribute to the movement and will essentially deactivate their muscles, resulting in a decrease in overall muscular effort. Consequently, the exoskeleton must generate the necessary torque to facilitate the movement of both the exoskeleton and the passive dynamics of the human body. The increase in human-exoskeleton interaction torques, in this scenario, is not due to conflicts between the exoskeleton’s motion and the user’s desired motion but rather because the exoskeleton is effectively carrying the user’s body.\
• Human Takes Control (∆τ < 0 , ∆µ > 0) In a contrasting scenario, the user may actively participate in the motion, resulting in an increased level of muscular effort. Consequently, the total interaction torque between the user and the exoskeleton may decrease. This reduction occurs because the human and exoskeleton motions are synchronized in time and consistent in space, creating a harmonious alignment between the two.\
We conducted the aforementioned analysis at various speeds for the TBC→HTC, TBC→AMTC, and HTC→AMTC cases. We also performed a stride-wise analysis for the TBC→HTC and TBC→AMTC scenarios, which involves computing changes of total interaction force and muscle effort at each stride during the HTC and AMTC controllers as\
where c ∈ {HTC, MBTC}. These calculations allowed us to analyze the precise changes in interaction force and muscular effort for each stride during the HTC and AMTC controllers in relation to the TBC controller.5.4.6 Statistical AnalysisTo identify statistical differences, we initially employed a Friedman test with a significance level of 0.05 to test group-level differences. Following the Friedman test, we conducted pairwise comparisons, between the blocks, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. To account for multiple comparisons between the three blocks, we applied the Bonferroni correction.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brazil slams US after dozens of deportees arrive handcuffed</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/brazil-slams-us-dozens-deportees-065725467.html</link><author>/u/KiraCosmicGod</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 15:41:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brazil's government expressed outrage on Saturday after dozens of immigrants deported from the United States arrived by plane in handcuffs, calling it a "flagrant disregard" for their rights.The foreign ministry said it would demand an explanation from Washington over the "degrading treatment of passengers on the flight".The spat comes as Latin America grapples with US President Donald Trump's return to power bringing a hard-line anti-immigration agenda, promising crackdowns on irregular migration and mass deportations.When the plane landed in the northern city of Manaus, Brazilian authorities ordered US officials to "immediately remove the handcuffs," the justice ministry said in a statement.Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski told President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of "the flagrant disregard for the fundamental rights of Brazilian citizens," the statement said.Brazil will request "explanations from the US government about the degrading treatment of passengers" on the Friday night flight, the foreign ministry said on X.The government said 88 Brazilians were aboard the aircraft.Edgar Da Silva Moura, a 31-year-old computer technician, was on the flight, after seven months in detention in the United States."On the plane they didn't give us water, we were tied hands and feet, they wouldn't even let us go to the bathroom," he told AFP."It was very hot, some people fainted."Luis Antonio Rodrigues Santos, a 21-year-old freelancer, recounted the "nightmare" of people with "respiratory problems" during "four hours without air conditioning" due to technical issues on the plane."Things have already changed (with Trump), immigrants are treated as criminals," he said.The flight was originally destined for the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte, but encountered a technical issue forcing it to land in Manaus.A government source told AFP the deportation flight was not directly linked to any immigration orders issued by Trump upon taking office Monday, but rather stemmed from a 2017 bilateral agreement.Brazil's Minister of Human Rights, Macae Evaristo, told journalists that "children with autism ... who went through very serious experiences" were also on the flight.Footage on Brazilian television showed some passengers descending from the civilian aircraft, with their hands handcuffed and their ankles shackled."Upon learning of the situation, President Lula ordered that a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) aircraft be mobilized to transport the Brazilians to their final destination, in order to ensure that they could complete their journey with dignity and safety," the justice ministry said.Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions aimed at overhauling entry to the United States.On his first day in office he signed orders declaring a "national emergency" at the southern US border and announced the deployment of more troops to the area while vowing to deport "criminal aliens."Several deportation flights since Monday have garnered public and media attention, though such actions were also common under previous US presidents.In a break with prior practice, however, the Trump administration has begun using military aircraft for repatriation flights, with at least one landing in Guatemala this week.The plane which landed in Manaus was not a military aircraft, AFP journalists in the city confirmed.A Brazilian government source said that the deportees who arrived in Manaus traveled "with their documents", which shows that they agreed to return home.There are an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security statistics.The United States also expelled 265 migrants to Guatemala on Friday.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe Made More Electricity from Solar Than Coal In 2024</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/01/25/0119258/europe-made-more-electricity-from-solar-than-coal-in-2024?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long-time Slashdot reader AmiMoJo shared this report from the Guardian:
More electricity was made from sunshine than coal in the EU last year, a report has found, in what analysts called a "milestone" for the clean energy transition. Solar panels generated 11% of the EU's electricity in 2024, while coal-burning power plants generated 10%, according to data from climate thinktank Ember... 

Coal-burning in the EU power sector peaked in 2003 and has fallen by 68% since then. At the same time, clean sources of electricity have boomed. Wind and solar energy rose to 29% of EU electricity generation in 2024, while hydropower and nuclear energy continued to rebound from the 2022 lows... 

The report found the share of coal fell in 16 of the 17 countries that still used it in 2024. It said the fuel has become "marginal or absent" in most systems. Germany and Poland, the two countries that burn most of the EU's coal, were among those where there was a shift to cleaner sources of energy. The share of coal in Germany's electricity grid fell 17% year-on-year, while in Poland it dropped8%, the report found.
 
Fossil gas also fell for the fifth year in a row, declining in 14 of the 26 countries, according to the article, and now accounting for just 16% of the electricity mix. 

"The findings come despite a small increase in electricity demand after two years of steep decline brought on by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Squeezes In More RDNA4 Changes For Linux 6.14 - Enables Cleaner Shader On GFX12</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMDGPU-More-GFX12-Linux-6.14</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 15:25:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While the main feature pull of new and updated kernel graphics/accelerator drivers were merged already for the ongoing Linux 6.14 merge window, an additional set of AMDGPU changes were sent out this week for squeezing into this next kernel release...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It&apos;s not a crime if we do it with an app</title><link>https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/25/potatotrac/#carbo-loading</link><author>keepit</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 15:24:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The core regulatory proposition of the tech industry is "it's not a crime if we do it with an app." It's not an unlicensed taxi if we do it with an app. It's not an illegal hotel room if we do it with an app. It's not an unregistered security if we do it with an app. It's not wage theft if we do it with an app.Inflation is one of the most politically salient factors of this decade, and so much of inflation can be attributed to a crime, done with an app, with impunity for the criminals. The entire food supply has been sewn up by cartels of 2-5 giant companies, and they colluded to raise prices, and bragged about it, and got away with it, because neoclassical economists insist that it's impossible for this kind of price fixing to occur in an "efficient market."Some of these cartels are well-known, like the Coke/Pepsi duopoly. Pepsi's bosses boasted to their shareholders about "Pepsi pricing power," and how they were able to raise prices over the inflationary increases caused by covid and the Russian invasion of Ukraine:You might know that pretty much every packaged good in your grocery store is made by one of two companies, Unilever and Procter and Gamble. Both CEOs boasted to their investors about their above-inflation price increases:But other cartels are harder to spot. It may seem like your grocer's eggs department is filled with many different companies' products. In reality, a single company, Cal-Maine Foods, owns practically every brand of eggs in the case: Farmhouse Eggs, Sunups, Sunny Meadow, Egg-Land’s Best and Land O’ Lakes. They made record profits after the pandemic and through bird flu, a fact that CFO Max Bowman attributed to "significantly higher selling prices" and "our ability to adapt to inflationary market pressures":But Cal-Maine is comparatively transparent. The other food cartels – especially those that serve the restaurant sector – are harder to spot. In , Katya Schwenk describes how four companies – Lamb Weston, JR Simplot, McCain Foods and Cavendish Farms – have captured the frozen potato market and all that comes with it (fries, tater tots, etc):These companies have been hiking prices for years, but  started to turn the screws during the post-covid inflationary period. One of Schwenk's sources is Josh Saltzman, owner of the DC sports bar Ivy and Coney. Ten years ago, Saltzman charged $3 for fries; now it's $6 – and Saltzman's margins have declined. Saltzman has a limited number of suppliers, and they all get their potatoes from Big Potato, and they bundle those potato orders with their other supplies, making it effectively impossible for Saltzman to buy his potatoes from anyone else.Big Potato controls  of the frozen potato market, and any sector that large and concentrated is going to be pretty cozy. The execs at these companies all meet at industry associations, lobbying bodies, and as they job-hop between companies in the cartel. But they don't have to rely on personal connections to rig the price of potatoes: they do it through a third-party data-broker called Potatotrac. Each cartel member sends all their commercially sensitive data – supply costs, pricing, sales figures – to Potatotrac, and then Potatotrac uses that data to give "advice" to the cartel members about "optimal pricing."This is just price-fixing, with an app. The fact that they don't sit around a table and openly discuss pricing doesn't keep this from being price-fixing. What's more, they . A director at McCain said that "higher ups" forbade anyone in the company from competing on price. A Lamb Weston exec described the arrangement as everyone "behaving themselves," chortling that they'd "never seen margins this high in the history of the potato industry." Lamb Weston's CEO attributed a 111% increase in net income to "pricing actions."Lamb Weston's execs understand that they're driving small restaurants out of business, and that the real beneficiaries are big chains that can pass the price increases onto their customers, like "Chili’s and the Texas Roadhouses and Cheesecake Factory":This is by no means unique to the potato industry. A data-broker called Agri Stats works with America's largest meat-packers to rig the price of meat – packers send Agri Stats the same kind of data that Big Potato sends to Potatotrac, and Agri Stats sends back the same "recommendations" that allow them to raise meat prices across the board, in lockstep:Lots of food categories are as inbred as meat and potatoes: "four firms controlled nearly 80 percent of the almond milk market, for instance. Three companies controlled 83 percent of the canned tuna market, and four companies controlled more than 86 percent of the microwave popcorn market."The "price fixing is legal if we do it with an app" gambit is not just about food, either. Apps like Realpage let big corporate landlords – who've bought up a sizable fraction of all the available homes in America – collude to raise rents:And private equity companies have rolled up all the  companies, hiking the price of trucks, creating backlogs and bottlenecks for parts and service, and starving the nation's municipalities (including Los Angeles) of fire-fighting equipment:This kind of price-fixing was central to the enforcement actions of the Biden administration's trustbusters at the FTC, and their investigations and actions inspired state AGs and private parties to bring their own antitrust suits. The question is, will Trump's enforcers continue this agenda? And will Trump's judges – steeped in Heritage Foundation economics that insists that monopolies are "efficient" – find in their favor if they do?Inflation has lots of causes, it's true. But when an industry is consolidated enough to take advantage of a data brokerage or just engage in tacit collusion,  source of inflation – war, disease, weather – allows whole sectors to raise prices together, and keep them high, long after the shock has passed.Picks and Shovels: a sequel to "Red Team Blues," about the heroic era of the PC, Tor Books, February 2025Unauthorized Bread: a middle-grades graphic novel adapted from my novella about refugees, toasters and DRM, FirstSecond, 2025Enshittification: a nonfiction book about platform decay for Farrar, Straus, Giroux.

But my excitement really increased after this post was published in December 2024. It announced that the framework would become an independent project, separated from the Encore Cloud tool.
This decision can make the framework more attractive to companies and developers who want to use it in their existing environments. I have nothing against Encore Cloud, which seems to be a very interesting and robust solution, but this freedom of choice favors adoption in companies of different sizes.Given this initial context, I decided to port a project that I use to write texts and lectures about microservices to Encore, and the result is a series of posts, this being the first. The initial idea is to divide the series as follows:Creating an API with a database (<— you are here)Interservice communication and authenticationCommunication via Pub/SubI may create new posts while writing the following parts, but the initial plan is defined. So, let’s go to the first part.Creating an API with a databaseTo use Encore, we need to install its CLI, which we will use throughout the development cycle. Since I use macOS, I installed it using the command:brew install encoredev/tap/encore
In the documentation, you can see the other possible installation methods.With the CLI installed, we can use it to create the project:Since I chose the option to create a project from scratch, the created directory only contains the files with the dependencies  ( and ) and , which will be used by the CLI to manipulate the project. Its initial content is straightforward:For now, we won’t need to change anything in , so let’s create the structure of the first microservice:In addition to creating the directory, we initialize a file called , where we will define our API. The content of the first version was as follows:Encore extensively uses the concept of  to define the application’s behavior and generate the code necessary for execution. The first example of this is the creation of a :Another common feature of frameworks like Encore is the existence of conventions. The first one we will find here is the initialization of services. Since we have defined a service called , we can create a function called  that will be invoked by the framework. In this function, we will inject the service dependencies, as we will do later in the project.The following annotation we see in the code is the one that defines an API, as in the example:This declaration tells the framework that this is a public API (we’ll see more about this in the following parts of this series) whose path is  and that it will be accessed via the  method.
An API is a function that receives a context and a parameter struct (in this case, ) and returns a response struct (in this case, ).One of the interesting features of the framework is the ease of accessing the parameter values: we can use the values ​​as , which is part of the received struct, without needing to convert the received JSON. More details about parameter handling and examples can be found in the official documentation.We can now run the project using the CLI:We can see that the API is available at the URL  and the development dashboard, which is one of the biggest attractions of the framework. How it works can be seen below:In the video, you can see the interesting features available, such as testing the API and viewing traces and application components. The dashboard will become even more useful as we add layers of complexity to the project.The next step in developing the application is to define a database. We need to have Docker installed and running to do this since Encore will use it to create the database image. At the time of writing, the available database is PostgreSQL. In the , we will make the following changes:As you can see in the excerpt, Encore uses the concept of , which is very useful. It was necessary to create the directory  and the file user/migrations/1_create_tables.up.sql with the following content:The database is created in the file, and a record is also inserted for use in tests via the dashboard. More details about migrations can be seen in the documentation.Another interesting feature of the command  is that it auto-reloads the application. Whenever something is changed in one of the project files, the application is recompiled and executed again, so your database should have been created successfully.To finalize this first version of the project, I created other files to complement the functionality. Using a framework like Encore makes repetitive tasks much more straightforward, such as configuring routes, converting parameters and responses, etc. However, it does not eliminate the need to use good development practices, such as abstractions, decoupling, etc. With this in mind, I created other files that are important for our project:user.go, which defines what a “user” in the application isservice.go, which contains the application’s business rule and will be used by the APIsecurity/jwt.go, which includes the logic for generating and validating JWT tokensWith these auxiliary files, the final version of our API looks like this:In this new version, you can see that we initialize the service (in the function ) with the injection of the business rule and the error handling provided by the framework.Another advantage of using a framework like Encore is that it provides features that help with the critical task of writing tests. In this first version, we have two crucial components to test:The highlight is the use of the package , which provides a way to ensure that tests can be executed in parallel (et.EnableServiceInstanceIsolation()) and the ease of using an exclusive database for tests (testDB, err:= et.NewTestDatabase(ctx, "user")).The interesting thing is that migrations are used automatically, making the test easier to write and execute.In this test, nothing from the framework was necessary; just good old Go, with its native advantages, was used.An important detail: to run the tests, you must use the CLI. Therefore, instead of running them using the command:There is a plugin for Goland that allows execution directly through the IDE, but the same is not yet true for VSCode, as can be seen in the official testing documentation.The objective of this first post was to present the basics of the framework and spark your curiosity about the next chapters in this series.I’ll leave my opinions on the framework for the last part of the series so I can provide more arguments to say whether I liked the experience or not. But I can say that I’m having a lot of fun with the first steps. What about you, dear reader? What do you think of Encore so far?

By now the application is quite mature and I have quite some queries (13 tables, 10-15 query files, 50-100 queries).Now my application is evolving and I want to build another module, which needs its own separate schema. I could go all the way and split the application in two and have two databases, but for now a modular monolith with separate schemas will do just fine.The problem I now have is that those queries/tables assume the schema being used is `public`. Now, I'd like to split my queries into 2 schemas (`game` and `lobby`), but from what I understand the only way to achieve this is to migrate every single query (and corresponding golang imports) to the new schema manually.Is there a way to specify the schema context in which the queries are running and being generated without impacting the existing codebase too much (like, having to change all existing imports because the postgres schema changed)?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Danish Special Forces member in Greenland.

As the watery winter light dwindles outside, along with our conversation inside, Weinberg sighs and admits how, for more than 80 years, he has drifted off to sleep dreaming of his murdered family.Each morning, despite his failing eyesight, one of the first things he sees is the fading number 116927. He rolls up his sleeve to display the tattoo on his arm – a  souvenir of Auschwitz and part of his body since April 1943.“I only have to wash my face and it’s all there again,” he says.Weinberg spent nearly two years in the camp from April 1943. Days before the liberation on January 27th, 1945, he was enlisted in the first of three so-called death marches he endured to other notorious Nazi camps. He survived them all: Dora-Mittelbau, Neuengamme and Bergen-Belsen. It was here that teenage diarist Anne Frank and her sister Margot died of starvation and typhus in the last days of the war in April 1945.Four years older than Anne would be now, Weinberg remembers he was “living between the living and the bodies”, when the British soldiers arrived and liberated Bergen-Belsen, near Hanover. He is now one of a dwindling number of survivors of the Nazi extermination of European Jews. Those first 20 years of his life have haunted everything that followed. Even now, in his last years, it won’t let him go.“I saw normal people in Auschwitz and I saw sadists there who killed people,” he said. “Why? I cannot explain to you.”Eight decades on, the search for answers has taken on an added urgency – and not just for him. As the last survivors leave us, Europe is facing a new wave of extreme nationalism, flirtations with far-right politics and would-be fascist salutes. As memories fade, surveys show a plummeting level of information about the Holocaust. Facts are under attack.A 200-year-old observation from German philosopher GWF Hegel sums up the situation. “What experience and history teach is this: that peoples and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it,” Hegel argued in a lecture delivered in Berlin in 1822. “Amid the pressure of great events,” he added, “a general principle gives no help.”After Nazi Germany was conquered in May 1945, the pressure of its terrible events – including mass murder and mass theft – became clear, and great principles were adopted: never again, never forget.The legal struts of these principles were forged in the Allied-run Nuremberg trials of surviving Nazis, including international law and human rights. Germany’s postwar Basic Law or constitution reflects this in its first paragraph: “Human Dignity is inviolable.”Weinberg was 11 when he learned that his human dignity was very violable.He grew up in a small village of Rhauderfehn, near the Dutch border, with a brother, sister and very different parents: Flora, maternal and observant, and Alfred, a first World War veteran and butcher who just wanted to be German.Weeks after the Nazi takeover in 1933, locals renamed the town square Adolf Hitler Platz, raising a swastika flag daily and singing nationalist songs.Weinberg was thrown out of school in 1936, aged 11, but the lowest point came three years later. In the early hours of November 9th, 1938, neighbours broke into the Weinberg house, trashed the interior and ordered the shocked family up and out. As locals cheered and chanted “dirty Jews”, Flora and her children, along with other local Jewish women and children, were locked up in a local slaughterhouse.The hate we experienced in our youth, we carried that with us our whole livesThe men – including Weinberg’s father Alfred – vanished and were interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp outside Berlin.The so-called Kristallnacht, a countrywide Nazi-co-ordinated night of violence against German Jews, saw homes, businesses and places of worship destroyed, including the old synagogue in Leer. Local mayor Erich Drescher set fire to the   Torah, shouting: “We want to smoke the wolf from its lair.”After that, locals boycotted the Weinberg family butcher. Alfred Weinberg, who had donated meat to poor local families at Christmas, was now “the Jew Weinberg”.Like all Jews in East Friesland, the Weinbergs were ordered to leave on February 15th, 1940. Weinberg and his sister Friedel were sent to a farm in the country. Their older brother Dieter was arrested in February 1943. A month later, their parents vanished and most likely were murdered. In April of that year, Weinberg and Friedel were also detained and sent to Auschwitz.Weinberg was 18, exhausted and starving, after a horrific rail journey over days in a sealed cattle wagon. Then the train halted and the wagon door was yanked open to a hellscape of skeletal people, barking dogs and barks of “Out! Out!”“There were old people, people with handicaps, but no ladder or steps down, so they simply fell out and others trampled over them,” he says. “We had no idea what Auschwitz was.”Of the 950 people in the transport, he was one of the few not sent directly to the gas chambers. Instead he became one of 35,000 slave labourers in the Buna-Monowitz labour camp, also known as Auschwitz III, where German chemicals companies produced synthetic rubber and petrol. The life expectancy in the labour camp was three months, and fewer than 5,000 survived it.“Every day the guards would watch you,” Weinberg says, “and if you were particularly emaciated or had sores they would write down your  number and, next day, up the chimney you went.”By the end of the war he weighed 29kg, “a skeleton covered in skin – more dead than alive”, but Weinberg was reunited with his sister Friedel. After two years of struggle in Germany, they emigrated to the United States and remained close.They made their first trip back to Leer, with much hesitation, in 1985. Further trips followed, and they moved back permanently in 2012. Friedel died shortly thereafter. Neither had families, he said, because neither wanted to risk that their children might go through the same again.“The hate we experienced in our youth, we carried that with us our whole lives,” he says. “I still just don’t understand it.”No one does. Eight decades on – after countless books, films, documentaries, plays and studies – Auschwitz and the Holocaust continue to defy understanding.The facts, lined up and given dates and attribution, do not explain it. Not even Rudolf Höss, the Nazi commandant of Auschwitz from 1940 to 1943, could do so. At the Nuremberg war crimes trials, a prosecutor asked him: “Did you yourself ever feel pity with the victims, thinking of your own family and children?” Höss replied: “Yes.”So how, he was asked, was it possible for him to carry out these actions in spite of this?“In view of all these doubts which I had,” he said, “the only decisive argument was the strict order and the reason given for it by Reichsführer [Heinrich] Himmler.”Himmler was second-in-command to Adolf Hitler and steered the so-called “Final Solution” to murder Europe’s Jewish population.In 1943, with the industrialised murder machine up and running, Himmler told SS generals in an audience in Poznan: “We have the moral right, we were obligated to our people to kill this people which wanted to kill us.”If the Auschwitz gas chambers and crematorium are the end point, the beginning came two decades previously in a Bavarian prison cell. There, Hitler wrote his Mein Kampf tract, denouncing Jews as a “tyrant over peoples” and “parasite upon the nations” who  tried “to exterminate the national intelligentsia”, ruin national economies and make people “ripe for the slave’s lot”.His rabid views tapped into and exploited the widespread anti-Semitism of the era, shaped his political ideology and, once he was in power, were magnified by the Nazi propaganda machine through fear, repetition and volume.After the 1938 pogrom against German Jews, Berlin-based Irish diplomat Charles Bewley filed a report to Dublin identifying with key Nazi claims: that Jews dominated the worlds of finance and entertainment and used their influence to instil what he called “anti-Christian, antipatriotic and communistic” thinking.Their supposedly corrupting moral influence, wrote Bewley, helps explain the “elimination of the Jewish element from public life”.One of the curious moments in Hitler’s confused political tract is how he simultaneously blames international Jewry for perpetrating a “big lie” on an unsuspected western populace – while flagging how he plans to do so himself.“The broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily,” he wrote. “Thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.”Whether in scapegoating Jews for home-grown ills, or murdering the scapegoats in the name of German honour, the Nazis did so at a vast scale.Even at his Nuremberg trial for mass murder, Rudolf Höss reported with a perverse pride of “improvements” he had made to expand the capacity of the “death chambers” – gas chambers concealed as showers – to kill 2,000 people at a time.“I used Zyklon B which was a crystallised prussic acid which we dropped into the death chamber from a small opening,” he told the court. “It took from three to 15 minutes to kill the people in the death chamber, depending upon climatic conditions. We know when the people were dead because their screaming stopped.”Höss returned to Auschwitz one last time in April 1947 – for his execution. Despite his own testimony, denial of what had happened there – that there  had even been gas chambers at Auschwitz – was already up and running.It’s possible these views were always there and never went away, but are now showing themselves far more openlyIn 2000, revisionist British historian David Irving failed in his libel case against US historian Deborah Lipstadt for calling Irving a Holocaust denier over his questioning of the existence of the Auschwitz gas chambers.But that phenomenon – once the preserve of obscure publishing companies, crank historians and shabby back-room talks – is now thriving online.Two years ago, a United Nations report found that 16 per cent of Holocaust-related content on the big social-media platforms denies or distorts the fundamental facts.Given that social media is where many people inform themselves, such numbers are alarming. News that Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, himself from a Jewish family, is rolling back content moderation means the floodgates on Holocaust denial may have just been opened.This week the Conference of Jewish Material Claims against Germany, often referred to as the Claims Conference, launched a new campaign on Instagram with survivors – including Albrecht Weinberg – telling their stories directly.“We’re living in an era where social media offers young people optional truth, with no common ground on facts,” said Dr Ruth Kinet, Claims Conference spokeswoman in Berlin. “We are hoping to push back against this ... [When] a survivor speaks personally to a young person, it offers a particular form of intimacy between the user and their smartphone screen.”Uncertainty about the future of facts is compounded by wider questions about the next generation of Holocaust education: its form, its educators and its audience. Put simply: in an era of “too-long-didn’t-read”, is it realistic to expect anyone to grasp or maintain an understanding of a complex period such as the Holocaust – even on such important anniversaries as this?Many historians see Germany and Europe are at an in-between moment.Dr UW Neumärker is director of the memorial in Berlin to the murdered Jews of Europe, which marks its 20th anniversary this year and attracts 300,000 people annually to its underground museum. Scores more visit the striking open-air stone memorial above, beside the Brandenburg Gate.Such memorials and anniversary events remain important places and rituals, he says, but for many they have become ritualised.After 80 years – two full generations on – he sees a struggle to reduce historically complex eras such as the Holocaust to bite-sized, TikTok-friendly posts.That medium is ideal, however, for simplistic history, populism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Even in Germany, he says, social media is smashing taboos in public discourse.Seven years ago a leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) described the Nazi era as a splash of “bird shit” on the country’s otherwise glorious history. Next month, in federal elections, the party is likely to attract one in five voters.“It’s possible these views were always there and never went away, but are now showing themselves far more openly,” said Dr Neumärker. “I remain firmly convinced of the need to remind people of those murdered in the name of Germany. But my survivor friends are very resigned and say they have never been so depressed at what’s happening.”Someone has to open their mouth finally, in particular politicians, and ask people here: do you really want things again like they once were?Among those concerned survivors is Anita Lasker-Walfish, whose ability to play the cello saved her life in Auschwitz. Now 99 and in poor health, she has passed the torch to her Berlin-based daughter Maya, a therapist, author and documentary film-maker. After decades of public speaking and education, she describes her mother as “deeply concerned and upset” about what is going on.“Sometimes she questions whether all her work meant anything,” she said. “My mother has nothing against Germans, but she has a lot against ignorance.”As a second-generation representative, Maya Lasker-Walfish spent decades living with the silence and taboos of survival. Now she sees the world at a historical tipping point and senses a “wish to put a full stop, as the [survivor] generation is no longer in the world”.Her mother’s life motto was to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. “We are not prepared now for the large denial everywhere about what happened, but I make use of that as best I can  to engage and be more constructive,” said Maya, author of two books and a documentary. Like her mother, she is wary of official events around round-number dates and deeply concerned about political developments across Europe and the US. Her thoughts on Elon Musk’s outstretched arm at Donald Trump’s inauguration?“He knows what he’s doing,” she said. “Nazis are still here, it’s not history, whatever history is.”Back in East Friesland, Albrecht Weinberg agrees that he feels history creeping up on him again in the present. It was there when someone poured paint over the brass plaques or Stolpersteine for his dead relatives, laid in the ground before the former family home. It was there last year when the town’s old Jewish graveyard in Leer was desecrated with swastikas.“That was a second Holocaust for me, I said: ‘Get my suitcase; I have to leave again,’” he says.And history was there again when, earlier this month, the AfD distributed fake plane tickets to foreign nationals living in southern Germany.Weinberg remembers a group of men at the door in 1933, handing his father a handmade cardboard ticket: “Free Ticket to Palestine.”“Someone has to open their mouth finally, in particular politicians, and ask people here: do you really want things again like they once were?”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can the EU compete with China’s rail plans? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrvjMqshj0k</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rrvjMqshj0k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 14:24:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A deadly accident at a train station in Serbia has put a spotlight on China’s outsized role in the Balkans and Hungary, particularly its funding for large rail projects.

To maintain order, I use a generic heap of key-value pairs with an  insert time complexity.

In the current implementation, it requires a full scan of the heap to find the key-value pair to remove. I’ll probably find a more efficient way to handle this, but for now, in real-world use cases, it doesn’t seem like a major issue.Why do I need a sorted map?Quite simple: I need a recursive category tree that can be edited at runtime and must always remain ordered.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Functional Programming in Aviation • Tony Morris • YOW! 2017</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yq17s6dfFC4</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/yq17s6dfFC4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 13:01:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2017. #GOTOcon #YOW

ABSTRACT
In this talk & demo, we have a look at some of the low-hanging problems in general aviation and how functional programming can be applied to provide significant improvements in efficiency and air safety. The current solutions to problems such as navigation, traffic/terrain collision avoidance and weight/balance calculations will be demonstrated to the audience, mostly for amusement. More seriously, we will have a look at the legacy that has led to the way things are, and how to improve by applying our programming skills.

We will look at:
• how aviation safety is regulated.
• how aeronautical services are provided to flight operators.
• how aeronautical navigation is conducted and regulated.
• how the weight and balance for a flight is conducted.
• the methods by which aircraft and ground coordinate between each other.

We will see:
• some real (and basic) data management problems in aviation, that very obviously threaten safety, then solve them, using programming.
• we will see a live demonstration of aeronautical navigation methods, investigate incident reports where lives were lost as a result, and consider how our programming skills can yield improvements, possibly even save lives.
• we will conduct a real weight&balance calculation for a flight, then once hilarity inevitably ensues, we will look at the problems that arise by this method, then solve them using data structures and functional programming. Some of these practical problems are obvious, even to a non-aviator, and the predictable incident reports are the end result.
• finally, we will have a look at a live demonstration of a software defined radio (SDR), receiving ADS-B transmissions from aircraft (live), an #AHRS implementation and #GNSS receiver using off-the-shelf, low-cost parts. We will look at why these instruments are helpful to aircraft pilots and interact with that device using the #Haskell programming language.

But what about the possibility of an accidental leak (rather than Covid-19 originating in wild animal meat from the Wuhan Market)? "The agency has for years said it did not have enough information to determine which origin theory was more likely." 

CNN notes there's suddenly been a new announcement "just days" after the CIA's new director took the reins — former lawyer turned Republican House Representative John Ratcliffe. While the market-origin theory remains a possibility according to the CIA, CNN notes that Ratcliffe himself "has long favored the theory that the pandemic originated from research being done in China and vowed in an interview published in Breitbart on Thursday that he would make the issue a Day 1 priority." 

"We have low confidence in this judgement," the CIA says in the complete text of its announcement, "and will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA's assessment." 


After speaking to a U.S. official, CNN added these details about the assessment:
It was not made based on new intelligence gathered by the US government — officials have long said such intelligence is unlikely to surface so many years later — and instead was reached after a review of existing information. 
"CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible," a CIA spokesperson said in a statement Saturday. 

CNN adds that "Many scientists believe the virus occurred naturally in animals and spread to humans in an outbreak at a market in Wuhan, China...."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thousands protest against the far-right in Germany | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqxmaplGvzY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WqxmaplGvzY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 12:12:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahead of the February 23 election, thousands of protesters across Germany rallied for democracy and inclusion, voicing opposition to the rise of the far-right AfD.

It’s a nightly feature which puts in question my extreme emotions about it. On the other hand it means there’s time to stop it from getting stabilised and figure out something better.In this article I’ll describe the problem the feature addresses, the issues I have with the solution and describe some alternatives. As it turns out, things aren’t as easy as they seem on the first look.Consider the  routine below which copies data between two I/O streams. On each iteration of the loop, it zero-initialises the buffer which wastes time considering that  will override the data. The compiler doesn’t know that and has no choice but to fill the array with zeros each time. Even an obvious optimisation of moving the buffer declaration outside of the loop isn’t available to the compiler.fn slow_copy(
  mut rd: impl std::io::Read,
  mut wr: impl std::io::Write,
) -> std::io::Result<()> {
  loop {
    let mut buf = [0; 4096];
    let read = rd.read(&mut buf)?;
    if read == 0 {
      break Ok(());
    }
    wr.write_all(&buf[..read])?;
  }
}An attempt at a solution is to use  which makes it possible to declare a region of uninitialised memory. Some explicit pointer casting is necessary, but otherwise code using it is straightforward.use core::mem::MaybeUninit;

pub fn unsound_copy(
    mut rd: impl std::io::Read
    mut wr: impl std::io::Write,
) -> std::io::Result<()> {
  loop {
    let mut buf = [MaybeUninit::<u8>::uninit(); 4096];
    // 
    // For demonstration purposes only.
    let buf = unsafe {
      &mut *(&mut buf as *mut [_] as *mut [u8])
    };
    let read = rd.read(buf)?;
    if read == 0 {
      break Ok(());
    }
    wr.write_all(&buf[..read])?;
  }
}While replacing the array of zeros by an array of uninitialised values may work in specific circumstances, the code is unsound. Change to the compiler, its options, modification of unrelated parts of the code or using the function for a different  trait implementation may break the program in unpredictable ways.The solution in nightly Rust is the  struct. It’s a bytes slice which remembers how much of it has been initialised. It doesn’t own the memory and operates on a borrowed buffer (hence the name). It can point at an array on the stack or a slice living on the heap (such as ’s spare capacity). A naïve use of the feature is the following:#![feature(core_io_borrowed_buf, read_buf)]

use core::io::BorrowedBuf;
use core::mem::MaybeUninit;

fn almost_good_copy(
    mut rd: impl std::io::Read,
    mut wr: impl std::io::Write,
) -> std::io::Result<()> {
  loop {
    let mut buf = [MaybeUninit::uninit(); 4096];
    let mut buf = BorrowedBuf::from(&mut buf[..]);
    rd.read_buf(buf.unfilled())?;
    if buf.len() == 0 {
      break Ok(());
    }
    wr.write_all(buf.filled())?;
  }
}Issues with the While  appears to work as expected,  isn’t without its share of problems. I describe them below.The  does not seamlessly integrate with existing Rust code. In fact quite the opposite. APIs need to support it explicitly. For example, many third-party  implementations do not provide  method. In its absence, the default version initialises the memory and calls  negating any potential benefits of .Similarly, functions which take output slice as an argument — such as ’s  — could benefit from being able to write to uninitialised memory. However, to offer that benefit, they need to be changed to support . A motivated programmer can try adding necessary support to actively maintained packages, like , but what if one is stuck at an older version of the crate or deals with apparently abandoned crates like  or . To support those cases, forking would be necessary leading the programmer towards deeper circles of dependency hell.Then again, should functions such as  integrate with  in the first place instead of taking an  argument? The issue with the latter is that there’s no safe way to convert  into . As such, users who so far happily used such functions with regular initialised buffers would need convoluted incantation to make their previously straightforward code to compile. Meanwhile, creating  is somewhat convenient and can be done from initialised and uninitialised buffers alike.In addition to , the  crate offers a  method which fills a generic slice of integers with random data. It could easily work with  except that the struct works on  slices only. As a result, a crate which deals with different types cannot consistently use .I don’t know the reasons why  is not generic. It’s possible that its design focused on addressing the the  trait use case only. Complications around dealing with  types could have been a contributing factor. However, even then the type could be generic on  types. being optional brings another problem. Without full understanding of the behaviour and interactions of the  type, it’s easy to misuse it such as in . One can be excused from assuming that the function eliminates unnecessary initialisation. It declares an uninitialised region, wraps it in  and reads data into it. Even inspection of the assembly output shows lack of the  call.Alas, while  avoids memory initialisation when reading data from a , it wastes time zeroing the buffer when, for example, decompressing data with help of  crate (which does not offer custom  method) effectively becoming a .Unless the underlying type is known, the programmer must assume that  may resort to filling the memory. The proper use of  is to construct it only once so that it can remember that the memory has been initialised.#![feature(core_io_borrowed_buf, read_buf)]

use core::io::BorrowedBuf;
use core::mem::MaybeUninit;

fn copy(
  mut rd: impl std::io::Read,
  mut wr: impl std::io::Write,
) -> std::io::Result<()> {
  let mut buf = [MaybeUninit::uninit(); 4096];
  let mut buf = BorrowedBuf::from(&mut buf[..]);
  loop {
    buf.clear();
    rd.read_buf(buf.unfilled())?;
    if buf.len() == 0 {
      break Ok(());
    }
    wr.write_all(buf.filled())?;
  }
}With ’s complexity it’s not hard to imagine why people might use it in inefficient way. The struct is harder to understand than the unsound casting in . This may lead people to use the more straightforward option even if it’s not correct. An analogy to a  with its contents and spare capacity partially helps — a  has analogous filled and unfilled parts — but is an oversimplified view. A  is also split into initialised and uninitialised parts. The documentation visualises it as follows:There are reasons for this madness. Consider loop in the  function above. If  only knew how much of it was filled, each call to  would lose the information about memory being initialised. In the default implementation of  it would need to unnecessarily zero the whole buffer. Separately storing information about how much of the buffer has been filled and initialised, let the type avoid double-initialisation of memory.As an aside, I find modelling  as divided into filled and spare capacity with spare capacity further divided into initialised and uninitialised as more intuitive. Leaning into the analogy of  is in my opinion more natural and it helps by reinforcing terminology used in existing parts of the language rather than introducing new models.Having looked at issues with , let’s consider what people actually want. The easiest mental model is that uninitialised memory stores arbitrary data, unknown unless accessed. To achieve such semantics, the uninitialised memory would need to be . A frozen region becomes safe to read and can be accessed through regular Rust references. With freezing operation available, the buffer definition in the copying routine could be turned into something like:  let mut buf = [MaybeUninit::uninit(); 4096];
  // SAFETY: u8 has no invalid bit patterns.
  let buf = unsafe {
    MaybeUninit::slice_freeze_mut(&mut buf)
  };  let buf = MaybeUninit::frozen();
  // SAFETY: u8 has no invalid bit patterns.
  let mut buf: [u8; 4096] = unsafe { buf.assume_init() };Unsafe blocks are required to account for invalid bit patterns. With a trait like , a safe versions could exist. Either of those alternatives would require no new methods on the  trait and would work without any modifications on methods such as ’s .Why can’t we have what we want?Reading uninitialised memory is hardly an issue when analysing things on hardware level. So long as a memory address is mapped with proper permissions, accessing data from it will always produce some value. There’s no undefined behaviour there. In fact, in typical Linux environment all newly allocated anonymous pages are zero-initialised.tautology:
  cmp  BYTE PTR [rdi], 0
  je   tautology_ok
  cmp  BYTE PTR [rdi], 0
  jne  tautology_ok
  mov  al, 0
  ret
tautology_ok:
  mov  al, 1
  retAn x86 assembly function which checks whether value in memory is zero or non-zero. This seemingly tautological test can fail when operating on a memory page marked with  and the kernel changes the mapping in between the two memory reads.Unfortunately, even when looking from the point of view of machine code, this analysis isn’t complete…Giving advice about use of memory flag of the  system call allows user space to advise the kernel that (until next write) it no longer cares about contents of specified anonymous pages. This optimisation enables the kernel to discard those pages without swapping them to disk. While the advice is in effect, the user space  access the memory, but has no guarantee whether it’ll read the old values or zeros. Even code written directly in assembly language, like the  function on the right can result in unexpected behaviour.This isn’t a theoretical concern either. jemalloc, a somewhat popular memory allocator, uses  when memory is freed. As a result, new allocations returned from the allocator may point to region of memory where the  advice is in effect. Nicholas Ormrod, in his talk about C++  at Facebook, describes how interaction between jemalloc,  and reading uninitialised memory resulted in outages.To prevent this issue, the proposed  function would need to write into each page of the slice to make sure the kernel notices that the program cares about contents of the page again. This could be a simple loop stepping 4 KiB at a time and look something like the following:pub unsafe fn slice_freeze_mut<T>(
  slice: &mut [MaybeUninit<T>]
) -> &mut [T] {
  const PAGE_SIZE: usize = 4096;
  let ptr = slice.as_mut_ptr() as *mut _;
  let len = slice.len() * size_of::<T>();
  // SAFETY: It’s always safe to split MU object into MU bytes.
  let bytes: &mut [MaybeUninit<u8>] = unsafe {
    core::slice::from_raw_parts(ptr, len);
  };
  for el in bytes.iter_mut().step_by(PAGE_SIZE) {
    let p = el.as_mut_ptr();
    // SAFETY: Unsafe without language semantics change
    // since we’re reading uninitialised byte.
    unsafe { p.write_volatile(p.read()) };
  }
  // SAFETY: Caller promises that T has no invalid bit patterns,
  // but this is still unsafe without language semantics change
  // since we haven’t initialised all the bytes.
  unsafe { &mut *(slice as *mut _ as *mut [T]) }
}Unfortunately, this would hardly be the no-operation that people expect from writing into uninitialised memory. It would be an improvement over a full initialisation and would address some issues with  but would do that at the cost of unavoidable page touching.It may seem that the second form — the MaybeUninit::frozen().assume_init() variant — which creates frozen buffer directly on stack could be easier to optimise. The compiler controls the stack and unless it issues , no stack pages will be marked . Unfortunately it’s not clear that always hold true. For example, with async programming the stack lives God-knows-where and there may be other corner cases that would need to be considered.I started this article with a promise of some alternatives to  and yet, as I conclude it, no working alternative is presented. Indeed, this is perhaps what frustrates me the most about the . On the face of it, writing data into uninitialised memory is a feature with an obvious solution, but it doesn’t take long before all the obvious solutions clash with Rust’s safety requirements.So what’s a lowly programmer to do? Donald Knuth is often quoted as stating that ‘premature optimisation is the root of all evil’. True to that adage, in most cases it’s safe to pay the price of the memory initialisation. I/O operations usually take orders of magnitude more time so the time saved not initialising the memory is often negligible.But there is more to Knuth’s quote:We  forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimisation is the root of all evil.Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified.For the remaining 3%, the options now are somewhat bleak and depend on the particular code base. They may require switching to nightly compiler, patching third-party crates, going straight to doing unsafe syscalls (e.g. ) or isolating critical code paths and writing them in C.And while we deal with the lack of ideal solution for writing to uninitialised memory, maybe someone will figure out some alternative fast and ergonomic approach.1 The reference conversion itself is safe since all possible values of type  are valid values of type  and both those types have the same layout. However, the latter allows writing arbitrary data into the object which may result in invalid representation of  (see playground demonstration). With interior mutability, even converting shared references may lead to issues.2 I am aware that I presumptuously speak for everyone. However, I do believe that alternatives presented here, if they existed, would be favoured by everyone and that includes contributors to the  struct. As I discuss later, the type is the way it is not because that’s what anyone finds appealing but due to other constraints.3 Semantics that reading uninitialised memory has arbitrary but consistent value can be useful in practice. Briggs and Torczon describe in An efficient representation for sparse sets an algorithm which is built on such semantics.4 The atypical environment is µClinux which runs on platforms without memory management unit (MMU). It supports  option which skips zeroing of the memory region. However, even with that flag, allocated pages maintain consistent state.5 Donald E. Knuth. 1974. Structured Programming with  Statements.

			President Donald Trump wants to withdraw 20,000 U.S. troops from Europe and demand a subsidy from allies to pay for the remaining American military presence on the Continent, Italy’s leading news agency reported this week.On Thursday, ANSA said Trump has been delivering his troop-cut message to European leaders since taking office Monday.Trump “would like financial contributions from European countries because these soldiers are a deterrent, and the costs cannot be borne solely by American taxpayers,” a European diplomat told the news service.The Pentagon did not immediately respond Friday to questions about the report.Trump has long advocated for a smaller force in Europe, especially in Germany. At the end of his first term, he ordered 12,000 troops out of Germany, with some to be relocated to other areas in Europe and others back to the U.S.

			The plan was never put into effect and was later canceled by former President Joe Biden. However, Trump’s new Pentagon team has made clear that the U.S. needs to play a smaller military role in Europe and shift capabilities to the Pacific to counter a growing threat from China.The U.S. has about 65,000 troops permanently stationed in Europe and thousands more there on a rotational basis. Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the overall force level has been in the range of 100,000 troops.It’s unclear what units would be targeted for cuts, but the rotation of tank brigades to NATO’s eastern flank, a linchpin of allied deterrence since the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine, could bein Trump’s crosshairs.Newly installed defense officials have previouslyindicated that such rotations could be an area where the Pentagon could achieve savings. Other potential targets are assets that would be of value in deterring China in the Pacific, such as warships, long-range artillery and Patriot missile defense units. On Thursday, Trump told an audience of global leaders gathered at an economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the current NATO threshold of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense is insufficient.“I’m also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago,” Trump said, speaking virtually from Washington.Trump didn’t directly say the 5% standard would apply to the United States. Washington would have to significantly boost its own defense spending to hit the 5% mark. Currently, the U.S. spends about 3.4% of GDP on the defense budget. Going to 5% would push the Pentagon budget of roughly $842 billion to more than $1 trillion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mesa 25.0 Gets A New Vulkan Layer For Limiting The Amount Of Reported vRAM</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-Vulkan-vRAM-Report-Limit</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 11:49:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A half-year-old merge request from Igalia's Karmjit Mahil has been merged for Mesa 25.0 that is a Vulkan layer allowing for optionally limiting the amount of video memory reported to games/applications...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Donald Trump ridicules Denmark and insists US will take Greenland</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/a935f6dc-d915-4faf-93ef-280200374ce1</link><author>/u/Affectionate_Cat293</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 11:48:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Sound Hardware Supported By The Linux 6.14 Kernel</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-New-Sound-Hardware</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 11:40:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Merged this week for the Linux 6.14 kernel were the various sound/audio driver updates.

        Switzerland is excluded by the US from the group of allied countries which have unlimited access to chips required for artificial intelligence (AI).    The US recently changed the rules for the export of products related to artificial intelligence. Only countries that are considered allies are now allowed to access these computer chips. And Switzerland is not one of them.Only 18 countries are considered trustworthy allies in the US, including France, Germany and Japan. According to Washington, these nations are worthy of unrestricted access to these very powerful computer chips, which are manufactured exclusively by US companies.This new regulation will come into force in four months. After that, Switzerland will still be able to import these chips, but will be subject to a limited quota in the coming years.Experts are already expressing their concerns, as these chips are used extensively in academic research as well as by many companies.These technologies are already present in many areas and will be omnipresent in the coming months to years, says Olga Baranova on Swiss public television, RTS. She is Secretary General of the CH++ association, a citizens’ lobby to strengthen scientific and technological expertise in politics.Baranova also points out that the US largely dominates the market, which makes alternative supply difficult.It is not entirely clear why Switzerland is not one of the allied countries. The official US Department of Commerce document lists those countries they trust to protect their technology and have no restrictions. However, no individual statements were made regarding the excluded countries.Nevertheless, it seems clear that the main aim of this regulation is to deny rival countries, especially China, access to this cutting-edge technology. The US is not only trying to curb exports, but also to prevent Chinese companies from circumventing the restrictions by setting up subsidiaries abroad.Baranova is therefore calling on the Swiss government to show the US that Switzerland meets the criteria to be considered a trustworthy partner. “It is clearly up to Switzerland to demonstrate its reliability and provide the US with additional guarantees.”The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) is currently analysing the document and its potential impact on companies and research institutions. According to SECO, discussions have already begun with the US authorities to ensure that this regulation does not hinder research or innovation in Switzerland.SECO also points out that Switzerland is home to US companies and their research centres that make heavy use of these chips, such as Google.Translated from German by DeepL/dsThis news story has been written and carefully fact-checked by an external editorial team.

As a reminder, the networks, Smart and TGR, facilitated the movement of criminally gained funds from one country to another using cryptocurrency transfers. Such crypto transactions were used both to launder money and to bypass Western sanctions against Russia.As a result of the operation, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  five individuals and four entities associated with the criminal networks. The designation also included two crypto addresses used by two of the designated individuals. The addresses belonged to two Russian nationals, Elena Chirkinyan (Chirkinyan), the second-in-command within the TGR network, as well as Khadzhi Murat Dalgatovich Magomedov (Magomedov), a professional money launderer for Russian clients.Sanctioned Crypto Addresses: Six Lessons Learned1. USDT is #1 for launderingMost laundering operations relied on Tether (USDT), a commonly used stablecoin that preserves the value of transfers. Given the volume of transactions, including numerous cash-to-crypto exchanges, Tether allowed criminals to minimize value loss across transfers.2. 195M+ USDT laundered via Magomedov’s sanctioned walletThe total value of cryptocurrency laundered through Magomedov’s sanctioned wallet exceeded USDT 195 million, as outlined in the Counterparty Report below. The laundering activity included interactions with a wide range of counterparties, but the wallet’s largest counterparty was a major centralized exchange.\
Source: Gl Vision Protocol — 3. 146K+ USDT laundered through Chirkinyan’s wallet3. 146K+ USDT laundered through Chirkinyan’s walletIn contrast, the total value of cryptocurrency transacted through Chirkinyan’s wallet was much smaller, amounting to just over USDT 146,000. \n 4. Addresses made direct deposits to CEXs, including both well-regulated ones and sanctioned GarantexBoth wallets’ top counterparties included addresses at top well-known and well-regulated crypto exchanges.\
However, they also engaged in transactions with the Russian crypto exchange Garantex long after it  in April 2022. For example, Chirkinyan’s wallet received deposits totaling over USD 22,000 from Garantex between June 2022 and February 2023. Additionally, an unsanctioned wallet transferred 1,295 USDT to Chirkinyan’s wallet and over USD 41,000 to Garantex in October 2024, demonstrating ongoing use of this sanctioned entity.\
As for the number of counterparties involved, Magomedov’s wallet interacted with a significantly greater number of exchanges and counterparties compared to Chirkinyan’s wallet, including activity with a high-risk wallet previously flagged as a reported hack. Chirkinyan’s transactions mostly culminated in deposits to a prominent centralized exchange.\
Conversely, Magomedov’s transactions involved multiple counterparties. Notably, Magomedov’s activity did not include numerous hops aimed at obfuscating the flow of funds, opting instead for direct deposits to CEX deposit wallets.5. Wallets interacted with exchanges requiring partial KYCExcept for CEXs, wallets interacted with exchanges requiring KYC only partially, depending on the customer’s activity, such as where KYC would only be required for crypto transfers, but not fiat ones.6. Chirkinyan’s wallet received crypto from a Cyprus-based gambling serviceOne wallet was receiving incoming crypto transfers from a gambling service domiciled in Cyprus, which processes all its transactions in crypto.Sanctioned Crypto Addresses: Challenges for the IndustryWhile the two sanctioned wallets are unlikely to continue operating due to their identification by blockchain analytics providers and likely blacklisting by crypto exchanges, numerous connected wallets may continue transacting and being used by professional money launderers. These wallet networks pose ongoing risks. We recommend these wallets be placed under monitoring using a blockchain analytics provider to prevent exposure and ensure compliance.\
Even without reusing the wallets spotted as part of the transactional activity linked to the two sanctioned wallets, criminal networks can easily create new crypto addresses. Depending on the type of wallet and the platform being used, creating a wallet can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes. The process could be slower if it includes additional verification steps, such as Know Your Customer procedures, which are usually required by centralized exchanges for custodial wallets but are not often included for decentralized ones.In summary, while sanctioning these wallets was a necessary step, Chirkinyan’s and Magomedov’s wallets are unlikely to be reused for money laundering purposes. However, placing these wallets under monitoring and including them on an internal blacklist are recommended steps for industry players, such as crypto exchanges, to prevent any future exposure and to remain compliant.\
We also recommend that the full extent of these wallets’ activity be investigated and understood using a blockchain analytics tool and that all other direct past counterparties of these wallets be placed on a watchlist.\
As a common theme of the wallets’ activity was exposure to Garantex even after the exchange was sanctioned, it is advised that crypto industry participants use blockchain analytics to identify and prevent such exposure in the future.\
Finally, crypto wallets identified as having frequent high-value incoming and outgoing transactions with an unusually large number of counterparties should be considered as presenting a higher risk of money laundering.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Orange intelligence, an open source alternative to Apple Intelligence</title><link>https://github.com/sharingan-no-kakashi/orange-intelligence</link><author>MexicanYoda</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 11:02:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi HN! I’m excited to share Orange Intelligence, an open-source alternative to Apple Intelligence for macOS.Orange Intelligence allows you to interact with any text on your macOS system in a more powerful and customizable way. It brings a floating text processor that integrates seamlessly with your workflow. Whether you’re a developer, writer, or productivity enthusiast, this tool can boost your efficiency.
Key Features:    Floating Text Processor: Trigger a floating window by double-tapping the Option key to process selected text.
    Run Any Python Function: From basic text manipulations to running large language models (LLM) like OpenAI or local LLaMA, you can execute any Python function on the fly.
    Full Customization: Want to add your own functions or logic? Just write them in Python, and they’ll appear in the floating window.

How does it work?    Capture: Uses AppleScript to simulate a global Cmd+C and capture selected text from any active macOS app.
    Process: A floating window pops up, letting you choose what to do with the text (run a function, format it, or apply an LLM).
    Replace: After processing, the app returns focus to the original application and pastes the processed text back with a global Cmd+V.

Why open source?I built this to overcome the limitations of Apple’s proprietary tools, and I wanted to make it fully customizable and extendable. Orange Intelligence is built with Python and PyQt6, so it’s easy to adapt, extend, and contribute to.It’s not just a text processor—it’s a platform for building custom workflows, whether you want to automate simple tasks or integrate with complex AI systems.I’m looking forward to your thoughts, ideas, and contributions. Thanks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Israeli troops kill civilians returning to southern Lebanon villages | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWPR4syUVv8</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QWPR4syUVv8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:38:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Lebanese Health Ministry says at least two people are dead in southern Lebanon after Israeli soldiers fired on residents carrying Hezbollah flags.

Few voices carry the depth of insight that Ran Hammer brings to the table. A former corporate lawyer turned crypto innovator, Hammer has witnessed the transformation of digital finance from its nascent stages. In this exclusive interview, he pulls back the curtain on Orbs' groundbreaking Layer 3 solutions, sharing a narrative that bridges traditional finance and the cutting edge of web3 technology.\
 Hi Ran Hammer, welcome to our series on "Behind The Startup". As someone who has worked in areas such as law and business development. What insights and experience from your background have been most valuable in driving Orbs' growth?\
 Hey Ishan, thanks for the question. My crypto origin story begins in 2015. Back then, I was a corporate lawyer working mostly with startups in Tel Aviv. One of my clients reached out and told me they had raised funds in Bitcoin—which was around $280 at the time.\
Naturally, I had to ask, "What is Bitcoin?" That question started my journey down the rabbit hole. We ended up converting all their crowdfunding funds into BTC at $280, and that experience opened my eyes to the potential of crypto.\
Honestly, when building in crypto generally, and in DeFi specifically, it's a huge advantage to understand how things work in "the real world." We have this amazing technology that allows us to redesign legacy finance from scratch, but it really helps to also understand how traditional financial markets operate.\
At Orbs, our focus is on building real products that people actually use and that really generate positive revenue. It's funny, but this isn't always the standard in the industry right now, with a lot of DeFI based on unsustainable token emissions. Having a solid sense of how real businesses operate definitely gives us an edge.\
 Orbs positions itself as a Layer 3 solution for bringing CeFi-level execution to DeFi. Can you explain how Orbs technology stack achieves this without moving liquidity to a new chain, and what specific advantages this architecture offers over traditional solutions?\
 For sure, Orbs operates as a dPOS blockchain, but it doesn't hold its own assets on the chain itself. Instead, it functions as an abstraction or oracle chain that exists between EVM chains and the dApps that operate on them. Orbs has node operators, which we've dubbed Guardians, who run a decentralized compute layer that hosts Orbs L3 protocols, including dTWAP, dLIMIT, Liquidity Hub, and Perpetual Hub.\
What sets Orbs apart is its ability to enable developers to implement much more complex logic than what can be achieved using smart contract platforms alone, all while staying fully decentralized. This opens up possibilities for sophisticated applications without sacrificing the core principles of decentralization. \
The most apparent benefit of this approach is the enhanced execution capabilities, bringing CeFi-level performance to DeFi. Orbs' architecture also integrates seamlessly into existing ecosystems without fracturing liquidity further across new chains. Additionally, our protocols are designed to eliminate counterparty risk: funds never leave a user's wallet until an order is fully executed across all our protocols. This ensures a higher degree of security and trust while balancing innovation and user protection, offering developers and users the best of both worlds.\
 The dLIMIT and dTWAP protocols are key innovations from Orbs. How are these advanced order types changing the game for on-chain trading, and can you break down these order types of beginners who are just starting out in crypto?\
 dLIMIT and dTWAP have truly transformed the landscape of on-chain trading, and their adoption by major DEXs like PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, and others highlights their value. Even UniSwap has built its own version of advanced orders, underscoring how essential these tools are for traders today.\
A dLIMIT order allows users to buy or sell tokens at a specific price. Unlike traditional market orders, which execute immediately at the current price, dLIMIT orders ensure the user's desired price is met before execution. However, execution isn't guaranteed—it depends on the market price aligning with the order specifications. This gives traders more control, especially in volatile markets.\
dTWAP (Decentralized Time-Weighted Average Price) is an algorithmic trading strategy designed to minimize the market impact of large orders. It does this by splitting the order into smaller chunks that execute incrementally over a predefined time frame. For example, instead of swapping a large sum all at once, which could significantly impact the pool price, dTWAP executes smaller portions systematically. This not only reduces slippage but also ensures better price stability, which is crucial for traders managing significant assets.\
In DeFi, these tools are particularly important because liquidity pools need time to rebalance. By enabling features like precise execution with dLIMIT and efficient distribution with dTWAP, while using fully decentralised architecture, Orbs empowers traders to interact with decentralized exchanges in a way that was previously only available in CeFi.\
 With Animoca Japan joining as validator nodes on the Orbs Network, what role do you see gaming and Web3 playing in the future of DeFi?\
 On behalf of the team at Orbs, we're very thankful to Animoca Japan for helping us secure our network by becoming a validator node for Orbs. It is a testament to the robustness of our Japanese Community that without it, it is unlikely we would have had the opportunity. Regarding gaming in Web3, I view things as everything on-chain eventually flows back to DeFi, and I will explain. Truly on-chain games require infrastructure that has been built since DeFi's inception. \
When you have a game on-chain, the resulting outcome that we've seen from Axie Infinity to DeFi Kingdoms is that they require on-chain marketplaces for transacting in-game currency, collectibles, and other sorts of miscellaneous economies that form around the various ecosystems. For some games, you even have peer-to-peer lending, where resources are lent in exchange for yield that that player earns. It is thus in my view that DeFi and on-chain games are inseparable.\
 Looking ahead to 2025, what key developments do you anticipate in the DeFi space?\
 In general, I think there are three key components that will see development in 2025. Firstly, Abstraction, the UX of crypto remains very poor, from onboarding all the way to news users making their first swap on a DEX and interacting with a DeFi protocol. This remains a significant hurdle for the industry that is starting to see improvements. Secondly, aggregation, crypto liquidity remains fragmented across multiple chains, protocols, and on and off chain sources.\
There are now however multiple venues and even DEXs that are working to solve this and the technology will only improve as time goes on. Lastly, availability, simply just ensuring that we have the same options that we have in CeFi are also robustlessly available in DeFi wether it's liquidity, the same level experience of perpetual trading or advanced order types. On a more protocol level, intent-based architecture has the hallmarks of being a really really powerful tool that has a plethora of use cases from liquidity aggregation, to cross-chain swaps and bridging solutions. AI is also interesting and obviously super trendy right now, that can be implemented both as a way to abstract complexity away from users and eventually participating in markets.\
 The Liquidity Hub is designed to optimize DEX pricing through aggregated liquidity. Can you share some specific examples of how this has improved trading for web3 users?\
 Liquidity Hub (LH) solves significant pain points for traders. When a user goes to a DEX they have really no way of knowing if they're getting the best price possible. One could in theory check all of the different aggregators, cross-chain pools, and CeFi prices if available, but it's very time consuming and with price fluctuations it's nearly impossible to ensure that you get the best price available. When a user swaps on a DEX that has integrated LH, LH performs a dutch auction between all of the available routers, some of which that support cross-chain swaps as well as private liquidity in the form of market makers to truly ensure that they're getting one of if not the best price available.\
In this way, Liquidity Hub can be thought of as an intent based system that abstracts the complexity of needing to check all of the potentially hundreds of different venues to ensure that they've received a fair price. Lastly, due to the architecture of LH swaps that are routed through it are completely gassless which is an additional win for traders.\
 As someone deeply involved in both the legal and business aspects of blockchain, what regulatory developments do you foresee impacting DeFi in 2025, and how should web3 projects prepare?\
 Since our industry has been around, regulatory ambiguity has created a "chilling effect," sidelining significant capital from entering the DeFi space. While it's difficult to predict the future with certainty, we are starting to see positive signals that this trend could change. For instance, U.S. President Donald Trump, has recently expressed strong pro-crypto sentiments, which could play a pivotal role in shaping a more favorable regulatory framework if his policies are implemented.\
A clear and consistent regulatory environment in the U.S. would likely have a cascading effect, as many countries tend to follow America's lead when it comes to financial regulations. This clarity could unlock a wave of institutional capital for the blockchain industry, including DeFi, and spur innovation globally.\
Web3 projects should focus on building great products that genuinely bring value to their users. While it's essential to stay aware of evolving regulatory requirements and aim for compliance, the priority should always be on creating solutions that solve real problems and push the space forward. By focusing on innovation and user value, projects can position themselves for long-term success, no matter how the regulatory landscape evolves.\

But the Free Software Foundation evaluated Llama 3.1's license agreement, and announced this week that "this is not a free software license and you should not use it, nor any software released under it."


Not only does it deny users their freedom, but it also purports to hand over powers to the licensors that should only be exercised through lawmaking by democratically-elected governments. 

Moreover, it has been applied by Meta to a machine-learning (ML) application, even though the license completely fails to address software freedom challenges inherent in such applications.... 

We decided to review the Llama license because it is being applied to an ML application and model, while at the same time being presented by Meta as if it grants users a degree of software freedom. This is certainly not the case, and we want the free software community to have clarity on this.

Published in the Wall Street Journal, the excerpt includes pictures of young Bill Gates when he was 12 (dressed for a hike) and 14 (studying a teletype machine). 

Gates remembers forming "a sort of splinter group" from the Boy Scouts when he was 13 with a group of boys who "wanted more freedom and more risk" and took long hikes around Seattle, travelling hundreds of miles together on hikes as long as "seven days or more." (His favorite breakfast dish was Oscar Mayer Smokie Links.) But he also remembers another group of friends — Kent, Rick, and... Paul — who connected to a mainframe computer from a phone line at their private school. Both hiking and programming "felt like an adventure... exploring new worlds, traveling to places even most adults couldn't reach." 

Like hiking, programming fit me because it allowed me to define my own measure of success, and it seemed limitless, not determined by how fast I could run or how far I could throw. The logic, focus and stamina needed to write long, complicated programs came naturally to me. Unlike in hiking, among that group of friends, I was the leader. 
When Gates' school got a (DEC) PDP-8 — which cost $8,500 — "For a challenge, I decided I would try to write a version of the Basic programming language for the new computer..." And Gates remembers a long hike where "I silently honed my code" for its formula evaluator:

 I slimmed it down more, like whittling little pieces off a stick to sharpen the point. What I made seemed efficient and pleasingly simple. It was by far the best code I had ever written... 
By the time school started again in the fall, whoever had lent us the PDP-8 had reclaimed it. I never finished my Basic project. But the code I wrote on that hike, my formula evaluator — and its beauty — stayed with me. Three and a half years later, I was a sophomore in college not sure of my path in life when Paul Allen, one of my Lakeside friends, burst into my dorm room with news of a groundbreaking computer. I knew we could write a Basic language for it; we had a head start. 
Gates typed his code from that hike, "and with that planted the seed of what would become one of the world's largest companies and the beginning of a new industry." 

Gates cites Richard Feynman's description of the excitement and pleasure of "finding the thing out" — the reward for "all of the disciplined thinking and hard work." And he remembers his teenaged years as "intensely driven by the love of what I was learning, accruing expertise just when it was needed: at the dawn of the personal computer."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US issues broad freeze on foreign aid, excepting Israel and Egypt | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJWJ_p-z7Z4</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JJWJ_p-z7Z4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:53:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Trump administration has issued a halt to nearly all existing foreign aid, with the exception of that flowing to Israel and Egypt.

"[P]otential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft."

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure... "The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok," said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. "ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership...." Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux... 


Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as "qualified divestiture" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S... A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. "A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control," the Congressional staffer said. "There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access...." 


Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions "should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles." The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.
 

"Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin&apos;s Military Hallucinations with Karina Tseng and Anthony Ratinov</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diDnVUPRaYI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/diDnVUPRaYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch Karina & Anthony's full Polonaise performances:

What’s Going on in the Containerd Neighborhood? - Phil Estes, AWS; Samuel Karp, Google; Akihiro Suda, NTT; Michael Brown, IBM; Kirtana Ashok, Microsoft

Our recent maintainer sessions have covered the soon-to-launch containerd v2.0. During this session led by maintainers we will give a brief update on 2.0, but will spend more time looking at the ecosystem around us. Why does containerd exist? What value does it bring to the overall cloud native world? How are other projects using it to build and extend containerd in useful ways? We’ll spend some time on containerd’s largest subproject, nerdctl, which also has an upcoming 2.0 release, and additionally catch the community up on activity in our Rust subproject ecosystem, the runwasi containerd shim, and lazy loading snapshotters. Since this is KubeCon, we’ll also provide an update on CRI changes and KEP-driven additions around NRI, DRA, and checkpoint/restore. Attendees will leave with a broad view of the larger containerd ecosystem of projects as well as key information on how to get involved if you are interested to help and contribute in any way to the “containerd neighborhood!”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome &amp; Introduction: A Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the CNCF Landscape- Katherine Druckman, Lori Lorusso</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCAOa0-VdU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hTCAOa0-VdU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 23:37:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

It's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux "is the most widely used OS for data center servers," according to the article:

The team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. "All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it," said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. "If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the Internet could be positively affected by this." 

The University of Waterloo is building a green computer server room as part of its new mathematics building, and Karsten believes sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists. "We all have a part to play in building a greener future," he said. The Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the Linux OS, is a founder member of the Green Software Foundation, an organization set up to look at ways of developing "green software" — code that reduces energy consumption. 

Karsten "teamed up with Joe Damato, distinguished engineer at Fastly" to develop the 30 lines of code, according to an announcement from the university. "The Linux kernel code addition developed by Karsten and Damato was based on research published in ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review" (by Karsten and grad student Peter Cai). 

Their paper "reviews the performance characteristics of network stack processing for communication-heavy server applications," devising an "indirect methodology" to "identify and quantify the direct and indirect costs of asynchronous hardware interrupt requests (IRQ) as a major source of overhead... 

"Based on these findings, a small modification of a vanilla Linux system is devised that improves the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking significantly, resulting in up to 45% increased throughput..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump administration reportedly negotiating an Oracle takeover of TikTok</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/25/trump-administration-reportedly-negotiating-an-oracle-takeover-of-tiktok/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 22:56:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Trump administration is negotiating a deal that would see Oracle take over TikTok alongside new U.S. investors, according to a report in NPR.

Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expectations - Sohan Kunkerkar, Red Hat Inc

As Kubernetes and container technologies evolve, shifting from cgroup v1 to cgroup v2 has become a pivotal development. With cgroup v2 available in Kubernetes since v1.25, we're at a crossroads where many users and organizations must decide when and how to transition fully to this new system. Despite the benefits of cgroup v2, including better resource management and enhanced capabilities, users frequently encounter unexpected challenges signaling a gap in readiness and understanding. This talk will address the practical implications of moving to cgroup v2, discuss the coordinated efforts to deprecate cgroup v1, and propose actionable strategies to bridge the gap between the Kubernetes community, system administrators, and developers. By focusing on real-world experiences and providing clear guidance, this session aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this significant change confidently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Gender and Race Labels Are Applied to NFT Data Analysis</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-gender-and-race-labels-are-applied-to-nft-data-analysis?source=rss</link><author>CryptoPunk Forum</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:45:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Howard Zhong, MIT CSAIL (howardzh@mit.edu);(2) Mark Hamilton, MIT CSAIL, Microsoft (markth@mit.edu).We describe the methods of analyzing the gender and race biases in the prices of NFTs. We first summarize our data collection process (Section 2.1 and 2.2) and then describe how we statistically quantify the gender and racial biases among different NFTs (Section 2.3). The steps are shown in Figure 2. More detailed description of methods and implementation can be found in the Appendix.2.1 Initial Data CollectionOur dataset consists of NFTs transacted on OpenSea, which is the primary marketplace for NFTs on Ethereum. We query the OpenSea “v1/collections” endpoint at the end of November 2022 [15] to retrieve NFT metadata and last sale price. We choose 790 collections from the Kaggle Ethereum NFTs dataset [11] and NFTs from the top 30-day and all-time OpenSea volume leaderboard around November 2021. After the data collection process, we end up with ∼ 2.5 NFTs, each that have been transacted upon.2.2 Retrieving Race and Gender LabelsMany NFT collections do not represent humans, and therefore cannot be directly studied through the lens of race and gender. We select collections that have metadata with the words “male” and “female” and end with a total of 44 such collections with gender labels representing different avatars. Statistics on these 44 collections with gender labels can be found in Table 6 in Appendix A.2.\
As far as we know, this is the first NFT dataset with gender labels across many collections. However, race labels often do not exist in the metadata, so we are limited to only CryptoPunks, Avastar, and Dynamic Duelers for collections with race labels.To determine the statistical significance of the hypothesis that female NFTs are sold for less than male NFTs, we run both paired and unpaired one-sided Student’s t-tests [22].\
Unpaired vs Paired t-test: For unpaired t-test, we compare the mean of all NFT sale prices for male versus for female. For paired t-test, we calculate t-statistics on the paired difference of male and female prices marked to the daily mean price and the weekly mean price of the NFT. The paired t-test is used to isolate the male versus female price difference by fixing price variation across time.\
 As t-test assume normality of the data, we apply a log transformation to address this. With rare NFTs worth significantly more than common NFTs, NFT price distributions tend to follow a power law distribution [14]. Inspired by how stock prices follow a log-normal distribution [1], we applied the same transformation and found the distribution of log of price to be more normal. We refer to running the t-test on the log of prices as log t-test.\
 Outliers may occur due to very high selling prices for rare NFTs or very low selling prices due to humans errors while listing. We address outliers using Winsorization [19], or trimming outliers past a certain percentile. We report results for 0.1%, 1%, 2.5%, and 5% percentiles.\
The approach described above is also used to compare the prices of light and dark CryptoPunks. We report results from combinations of different t-tests and outlier detection methods to show our conclusion remains consistent regardless of the way we conduct the statistical significance test. For the figures and statistics in this paper, unless otherwise stated, we remove outliers at the 2.5% percentile.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Absence of Gender Bias in NFT Prices Likely Reflects Balanced Investor Demographics</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/absence-of-gender-bias-in-nft-prices-likely-reflects-balanced-investor-demographics?source=rss</link><author>CryptoPunk Forum</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:45:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Howard Zhong, MIT CSAIL (howardzh@mit.edu);(2) Mark Hamilton, MIT CSAIL, Microsoft (markth@mit.edu).We seek to determine what mechanisms produce the different biases and why there exists racial bias but not gender bias in the prices of NFTs. Most NFTs in the market, especially those with gender and race attributes, represent avatars. These NFTs, especially expensive ones like CryptoPunks, can be used as profile picture, and thus people may prefer NFTs that look similar to themselves. We thus believe the demographics of NFT investors are the mechanisms that produce these biases.\
According to a data by Statistica [2] [4], among the age group (18-34) with the largest interest in NFTs, men and women own NFTs fairly equally with 24% men and 21% women of total investor population. Thus, the fact we do not observe gender bias in NFT prices could be due to investors being roughly balanced across gender.\
However, the distribution of NFT buyers may be skewed white, which explains the existence of racial bias. Using Google searches as a proxy on the amount of NFT investors in a region, in the past five years, we found that the term “NFT” was most searched in East Asia and North America and least searched in Africa and India. Thus, more lighter-skinned people are interested in NFTs compared to darker-skinned people and may be why lighter-skinned NFTs are more in demand. The full map of Google searches can be found in Figure 7 in Appendix A.3.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unveiling Biases in NFT Pricing: Insights from CryptoPunks and Beyond</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/unveiling-biases-in-nft-pricing-insights-from-cryptopunks-and-beyond?source=rss</link><author>CryptoPunk Forum</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:45:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Howard Zhong, MIT CSAIL (howardzh@mit.edu);(2) Mark Hamilton, MIT CSAIL, Microsoft (markth@mit.edu).Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are non-interchangeable assets, usually digital art, which are stored on the blockchain. Preliminary studies find that female and darker-skinned NFTs are valued less than their male and lighter-skinned counterparts. However, these studies analyze only the CryptoPunks collection. We test the statistical significance of race and gender biases in the prices of CryptoPunks and present the first study of gender bias in the broader NFT market. We find evidence of racial bias but not gender bias. Our work also introduces a dataset of gender-labeled NFT collections to advance the broader study of social equity in this emerging market.Are darker-skinned Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) sold for less than lighter-skinned NFTs? Or, are female NFTs worth less than male NFTs? Egkolfopoulou and Gardner [8] raises diversity concerns by reporting preliminary results on price differences based on gender and race. Determining whether diversity issues are present in the early-stage NFT space is important to raise awareness and bring change.\
NFTs are tokens on a blockchain to represent ownership of a unique item. While the item can range from music, videos, or tweets, it usually represents the ownership of art. NFT’s popularity has boomed since 2021 as the public became accustomed to the concept. We analyze NFTs stored on the Ethereum network [9]\
As NFTs are such a new concept, the dynamics of the NFT market has not been well studied. There has been previous work about NFT economics with focus on the trade networks [14], the predictability of NFT sales [14], and the risk and returns of NFT investments, [13]. Other topics of interest include how NFT art may change the dynamics of art markets [3], how NFTs can affect game development by making the art tradable [10], and how it can revolutionize digital ownership in different industries [16]. Among the studies, one specific collection that is most analyzed to represent the NFT market is CryptoPunks [12] [18] [6].\
The CryptoPunk collection is one of the most well-known NFT collections and consists of 10,000 avatars on the Ethereum blockchain created by Larva Labs in 2017. They are commonly credited for starting the NFT boom in 2021 [20]. As shown in Figure 1, CryptoPunks are avatars that can be used to represent oneself in the digital world and therefore are of interest when studying the NFT diversity problem.\
We are interested in whether racial bias or gender bias exists in the NFT art market. In the December 2021 Bloomberg article “Even in the Metaverse, Not All Identities Are Created Equal”, Egkolfopoulou and Gardner [8] examined graphs of sales prices of CryptoPunks over time across different genders and different races. They found that female avatars were sold for less than male avatars, and darker-skinned avatars were sold for less than lighter-skinned NFTs. However, their evidence for gender and racial biases is limited to visual inspection of CryptoPunk’s historical price graphs instead. Thus, we test the statistical significance of race and gender biases in the prices of CryptoPunks and present the first study investigating gender bias in the broader NFT market.\
Our first goal is to analyze the gender and race biases of CryptoPunks rigorously through hypothesis testing. This will indicate whether price differences are significant enough to not be attributed to random chance. We find that darker-skinned CryptoPunks are sold for more than lighter-skinned CryptoPunks, but contrary to the analysis in [8], the difference in price for male and female CryptoPunks was not statistically significant.\
Our second goal is to extend our analysis to other collections to determine whether there are gender biases for the broader NFT market. To that end, we analyze 44 NFT collections labeled with gender tags and apply a hypothesis test to each collection to determine if male-looking NFTs sell at higher prices than female-looking ones. Like in CryptoPunks, we conclude that the price difference in male and female is not statistically significant. Because of the lack of race labels, we were only able to find 3 collections to categorize between light and dark skinned NFTs, with analysis suggesting lighter-skinned NFTs are sold for more than darker-skinned NFTs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Regional NFT Trends and Insights from 44 Avatar-Based Collections</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/regional-nft-trends-and-insights-from-44-avatar-based-collections?source=rss</link><author>CryptoPunk Forum</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:45:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Howard Zhong, MIT CSAIL (howardzh@mit.edu);(2) Mark Hamilton, MIT CSAIL, Microsoft (markth@mit.edu).The 44 collections that we sampled and analyzed are all NFTs representing avatars.

We found 44 collections with gender labels but only 3 with race labels.\
For the 44 NFT collections chosen as detailed in Section 2.2, we calculate p-values to determine whether male NFT prices are greater than female NFT prices. P-values are calculated from a paired log t-test marked to weekly mean with a outlier trim percentile of 2.5%. To satisfy preconditions of a t-test, we apply a log transformation to make prices follow a more normal distribution and remove outliers. We mark to weekly mean price, which is common for low transaction volume markets such as NFT markets [7]. From the analysis, we find no clear relationship between market cap and gender bias. However, we do demonstrate that male prices are not statistically significantly higher than female prices for the broader NFT market.\
Figure 5 displays collections with male price statistically significantly (α = 0.05) higher than female price (right red dots), female price statistically significantly higher than male price (left red dots), and no statistically significant difference (black dots). There is no clear relationship between market cap and mean price difference across gender, but the figure does answer whether male NFTs are priced higher than female NFTs across the aggregate market.\
First, the mean across all collections of the price difference of male and female NFTs is only 0.63%. Furthermore, at a significance level of α = 0.05, only 11 out of 44 collections have male NFTs valued more than female NFTs, whereas 7 collections have female NFTs valued more than male NFTs. Therefore, there is not enough evidence to conclude there is a statistically significant difference between male and female prices for the broader NFT market.\
In addition to CryptoPunks, we obtained race labels for the Avastar and Dynamic Duelers collections. From mean and median statistics in Table 4, we find that light-skinned NFTs on average tend to be sold for higher prices that darker-skinned counterpart. The result is less significant for Dynamic Duelers. For statistics in Table 4 and 5, we use outlier trim level of 2.5%.\
We also conduct hypothesis tests in Table 5 to determine the statistical significance of whether lighter-skinned NFTs are worth more than darker-skinned NFTs. With a majority of the p-values less than 0.2 and our conclusion from CryptoPunks, the results suggest lighter-skinned NFTs are worth more than darker-skinned NFTs, though not necessarily at a statistically significant level. Because this analysis is on a small subset of the entire NFT market, more data is required to generalize our conclusion to the entire NFT market.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lightning Talk: Minimizing Data Loss Within the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector - Alex Kats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxRkfVXdy9E</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xxRkfVXdy9E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:38:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lightning Talk: Minimizing Data Loss Within the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector - Alex Kats, Capital One

The OTel collector is meant to serve as a reliable and highly performant data pipeline. However, as a single component in a wider observability architecture, it is only as reliable as the downstream platforms/services it exports data to. The OTel collector has several built in mechanisms that aim to minimize the impact of unhealthy downstream exporters, including an out of the box sending queue with an additional configuration parameter for persistent queueing. There is a new component in the OTel contrib distribution, the Failover Connector. The Failover Connector allows for dynamic routing or “failover” of telemetry data based on downstream exporter health. This provides significant improvement to the data resiliency of the collector, as telemetry data can be continuously exported to a set of stable secondary locations, while the issues with the primary are resolved.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Media Driver 2024Q4 Released With Battlemage Video Encode</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Media-Driver-2024Q4</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:27:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Intel Media Driver 2024Q4 release was tagged this Saturday as the quarterly update to Intel's open-source Video Acceleration API (VA-API) driver for Linux systems...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KubeSlice: Migrate Kubernetes Services With Confidence! | Project Lightning Talk</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkl7EnILe-o</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Xkl7EnILe-o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 20:21:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

KubeSlice: Migrate Kubernetes Services With Confidence! | Project Lightning Talk

SREs have been constantly asked to look for solutions to help them migrate K8S services from one Cloud cluster to another Cloud cluster while continuing to provide secure access to managed Cloud services left behind in the original Cloud.

The K8S services securely access these managed services using private endpoint FQDN. When SREs are asked to move the K8S services to a different Cloud cluster they hit a roadblock - there is no easy solution to provide private endpoint FQDN access to a managed service from a remote Cloud cluster.

CNCF sandbox project KubeSlice solves this use case in an elegant way.

KubeSlice enables SREs to create a Slice across clusters and slice overlay network connects services in the clusters. An external services gateway on the Slice in the original Cloud cluster will provide access to managed services via alias service FQDN import. Services in other clusters can reach the cloud service via the same private endpoint FQDN resolved by the Slice DNS.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Now You See Me: Tame MTTR with Real-Time Anomaly Dete...

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.

Is consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it’s so hard to pin down what makes you “you.” From Descartes’ “beast machines” to Darwin’s revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. 

Will AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness—or even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids—tiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us—and why it matters.

The continent’s total gas reserves are almost as large as those of the US. But will local people actually benefit from the export of gas, as hoped?

Europe is looking for new gas producers. This is because Russia’s war against Ukraine has highlighted Europe's and especially Germany's dependence on Russian gas. One possible solution is to increase gas imports from Africa, which already account for around a fifth of the gas used in Europe.

Mozambique in southern Africa is expected to become the third largest African exporter of liquefied natural gas. Senegal in West Africa is also seen as a major future gas supplier. 

What does this development mean for the people of Mozambique and Senegal? Will they actually benefit from gas exports as hoped? Can the utilization of gas reserves create new jobs and help to reduce migration from Senegal to Europe? 

So far, the gas sector in Mozambique has led to conflict rather than prosperity. Is a turnaround in sight? Or is African gas coming too late to be relevant for European climate neutrality targets?

Basically, I am using these frontier models all day, every day, in about as intense a way as possible. I have 3 Claude accounts so I don't run out of requests, and signed up for ChatGPT Pro within minutes of it being available.I also try to keep on top of the latest research advances, and carefully read all the major technical report papers that come out from the major AI labs. So I think I have a pretty good read on the space and how things are developing. At the same time, I've shorted a ton of stocks in my life and have won the best idea prize on the Value Investors Club twice (for TMS long and PDH short if you're keeping track at home).I say this not to brag, but rather to help establish my bona fides as someone who could opine on the subject without coming across as hopelessly naive to either technologists or professional investors. And while there are surely many people who know the math/science better, and people who are better at long/short investing in the stock market than me, I doubt there are very many who are in the middle of the Venn diagram to the extent I can claim to be.With all that said, whenever I meet with and chat with my friends and ex colleagues from the hedge fund world, the conversation quickly turns to Nvidia. It's not every day that a company goes from relative obscurity to being worth more than the combined stock markets of England, France, or Germany! And naturally, these friends want to know my thoughts on the subject. Because I am such a dyed-in-the-wool believer in the long term transformative impact of this technology— I truly believe it's going to radically change nearly every aspect of our economy and society in the next 5-10 years, with basically no historical precedent— it has been hard for me to make the argument that Nvidia's momentum is going to slow down or stop anytime soon.But even though I've thought the valuation was just too rich for my blood for the past year or so, a confluence of recent developments has caused me to flip a bit to my usual instinct, which is to be a bit more contrarian in outlook and to question the consensus when it seems to be more than priced in. The saying "what the wise man believes in the beginning, the fool believes in the end" became famous for a good reason.Before we get into the developments that give me pause, let's pause to briefly review the bull case for NVDA shares, which is basically now known by everyone and his brother. Deep learning and AI are the most transformative technologies since the internet, and poised to change basically everything in our society. Nvidia has somehow ended up with something close to a monopoly in terms of the share of aggregate industry capex that is spent on training and inference infrastructure.Some of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Oracle, etc., have all decided that they must do and spend whatever it takes to stay competitive in this space because they simply cannot afford to be left behind. The amount of capex dollars, gigawatts of electricity used, square footage of new-build data centers, and, of course, the number of GPUs, has absolutely exploded and seems to show no sign of slowing down. And Nvidia is able to earn insanely high 90%+ gross margins on the most high-end, datacenter oriented products.We've just scratched the surface here of the bull case. There are many additional aspects to it now, which have made even people who were already very bullish to become incrementally more bullish. Besides things like the rise of humanoid robots, which I suspect is going to take most people by surprise when they are rapidly able to perform a huge number of tasks that currently require an unskilled (or even skilled) human worker (e.g., doing laundry, cleaning, organizing, and cooking; doing construction work like renovating a bathroom or building a house in a team of workers; running a warehouse and driving forklifts, etc.), there are other factors which most people haven't even considered.One major thing that you hear the smart crowd talking about is the rise of "a new scaling law," which has created a new paradigm thinking about how compute needs will increase over time. The original scaling law, which is what has been driving progress in AI since AlexNet appeared in 2012 and the Transformer architecture was invented in 2017, is the pre-training scaling law: that the more billions (and now trillions) worth of tokens we can use as training data, and the larger the parameter count of the models we are training, and the more FLOPS of compute that we expend on training those models on those tokens, the better the performance of the resulting models on a large variety of highly useful downstream tasks.Not only that, but this improvement is somewhat knowable, to the point where the leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic have a pretty good idea of just how good their latest models would be even before they started the actual training runs— in some cases, predicting the benchmarks of the final models to within a couple percentage points. This "original scaling law" has been vitally important, but always caused some doubts in the minds of people projecting the future with it.For one thing, we seem to have already exhausted the world's accumulated set of high quality training data. Of course, that's not literally true— there are still so many old books and periodicals that haven't yet been properly digitized, and even if they have, are not properly licensed for use as training data. The problem is that, even if you give credit for all that stuff— say the sum total of "professionally" produced English language written content from the year 1500 to, say, the year 2000, it's not such a tremendous amount in percentage terms when you're talking about a training corpus of nearly 15 trillion tokens, which is the scale of current frontier models.For a quick reality check of those numbers: Google Books has digitized around 40mm books so far; if a typical book has 50k to 100k words, or 65k to 130k tokens, then that's between 2.6T and 5.2T tokens just from books, though surely a large chunk of that is already included in the training corpora used by the big labs, whether it's strictly legal or not. And there are lots of academic papers, with the arXiv website alone having over 2mm papers. And the Library of Congress has over 3 billion digitized newspaper pages. Taken together, that could be as much as 7T tokens in total, but since much of this is in fact included in training corpora, the remaining "incremental" training data probably isn't all that significant in the grand scheme of things.Of course, there are other ways to gather more training data. You could automatically transcribe every single YouTube video for example, and use that text. And while that might be helpful on the margin, it's certainly of much lower quality than, say, a highly respected textbook on Organic Chemistry as a source of useful knowledge about the world. So we've always had a looming "data wall" when it comes to the original scaling law; although we know we can keep shoveling more and more capex into GPUs and building more and more data centers, it's a lot harder to mass produce useful new human knowledge which is correct and incremental to what is already out there. Now, one intriguing response to this has been the rise of "synthetic data," which is text that is itself the output of an LLM. And while this seems almost nonsensical that it would work to "get high on your own supply" as a way of improving model quality, it actually seems to work very well in practice, at least in the domain of math, logic, and computer programming.The reason, of course, is that these are areas where we can mechanically check and prove the correctness of things. So we can sample from the vast universe of possible math theorems or possible Python scripts, and then actually check if they are correct, and only include them in our corpus if they are. And in this way, we can very dramatically expand our collection of high quality training data, at least in these kinds of areas.And then there are all the other kinds of data we could be training AI on besides text. For example, what if we take the entire whole genome sequencing (around 200 GB to 300 GB uncompressed for a single human being) for 100 million people? That's a  of data obviously, although the vast majority of it would be nearly identical between any two people. Of course, this could be misleading to compare to textual data from books and the internet for various reasons:Raw genome size isn't directly comparable to token countsThe information content of genomic data is very different from textThe training value of highly redundant data isn't clearThe computational requirements for processing genomic data are differentBut it's still another large source of diverse information that we could train huge models on in the future, which is why I included it.So while there is some hope in terms of being able to capture more and more additional training data, if you look at the rate at which training corpora have grown in recent years, it quickly becomes obvious that we are close to hitting a wall in terms of data availability for "generally useful" knowledge that can get us closer to the ultimate goal of getting artificial super-intelligence which is 10x smarter than John von Neumann and is an absolute world-class expert on every specialty known to man.Besides the limited amount of available data, there have always been a couple other things that have lurked in the back of the mind of proponents of the pre-training scaling law. A big one of these is, after you've finished training the model, what are you supposed to do with all that compute infrastructure? Train the next model? Sure, you can do that, but given the rapid improvement in GPU speed and capacity, and the importance of electricity and other opex in the economic calculations, does it even really make sense to use your 2 year old cluster to train your new model? Surely you'd rather use the brand new data center you just built that costs 10x the old data center and is 20x more powerful because of better technology. The problem is, at some point you do need to amortize the up-front cost of these investments and recoup it with a stream of (hopefully positive) operating profit, right?The market is so excited about AI that it has thankfully ignored this, allowing companies like OpenAI to post breathtaking from-inception, cumulative operating losses while garnering increasingly eye-popping valuations in follow-up investment rounds (although, to their credit, they have also been able to demonstrate very fast growing revenues). But eventually, for this situation to be sustainable over a full market cycle, these data center costs do need to eventually be recouped, hopefully with a profit, which over time is competitive with other investment opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis.OK, so that was the pre-training scaling law. What's this "new" scaling law? Well, that's something that people really just started focusing on in the past year: inference time compute scaling. Before, the vast majority of all the compute you'd expend in the process was the up-front training compute to create the model in the first place. Once you had the trained model, performing inference on that model— i.e., asking a question or having the LLM perform some kind of task for you— used a certain, limited amount of compute.Critically, the total amount of inference compute (measured in various ways, such as FLOPS, in GPU memory footprint, etc.) was much, much less than what was required for the pre-training phase. Of course, the amount of inference compute does flex up when you increase the context window size of the models and the amount of output that you generate from them in one go (although researchers have made breathtaking algorithmic improvements on this front relative to the initial quadratic scaling people originally expected in scaling this up). But essentially, until recently, inference compute was generally a lot less intensive than training compute, and scaled basically linearly with the number of requests you are handling— the more demand for text completions from ChatGPT, for instance, the more inference compute you used up.With the advent of the revolutionary Chain-of-Thought ("COT") models introduced in the past year, most noticeably in OpenAI's flagship O1 model (but very recently in DeepSeek's new R1 model, which we will talk about later in much more detail), all that changed. Instead of the amount of inference compute being directly proportional to the length of the output text generated by the model (scaling up for larger context windows, model size, etc.), these new COT models also generate intermediate "logic tokens"; think of this as a sort of scratchpad or "internal monologue" of the model while it's trying to solve your problem or complete its assigned task.This represents a true sea change in how inference compute works: now, the more tokens you use for this internal chain of thought process, the better the quality of the final output you can provide the user. In effect, it's like giving a human worker more time and resources to accomplish a task, so they can double and triple check their work, do the same basic task in multiple different ways and verify that they come out the same way; take the result they came up with and "plug it in" to the formula to check that it actually does solve the equation, etc.It turns out that this approach works almost amazingly well; it is essentially leveraging the long anticipated power of what is called "reinforcement learning" with the power of the Transformer architecture. It directly addresses the single biggest weakness of the otherwise phenomenally successful Transformer model, which is its propensity to "hallucinate".Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct.Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense.Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this approach, beyond the fact that it works at all, is that the more logic/COT tokens you use, the better it works. Suddenly, you now have an additional dial you can turn so that, as you increase the amount of COT reasoning tokens (which uses a lot more inference compute, both in terms of FLOPS and memory), the higher the probability is that you will give a correct response— code that runs the first time without errors, or a solution to a logic problem without an obviously wrong deductive step.I can tell you from a lot of firsthand experience that, as good as Anthropic's Claude3.5 Sonnet model is at Python programming— and it is indeed VERY good— whenever you need to generate anything long and complicated, it invariably ends up making one or more stupid mistakes. Now, these mistakes are usually pretty easy to fix, and in fact you can normally fix them by simply feeding the errors generated by the Python interpreter, without any further explanation, as a follow-up inference prompt (or, more usefully, paste in the complete set of detected "problems" found in the code by your code editor, using what something called a Linter), it was still an annoying additional step. And when the code becomes very long or very complicated, it can sometimes take a lot longer to fix, and might even require some manual debugging by hand.The first time I tried the O1 model from OpenAI was like a revelation: I was amazed how often the code would be perfect the very first time. And that's because the COT process automatically finds and fixes problems before they ever make it to a final response token in the answer the model gives you.In fact, the O1 model used in OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus subscription for $20/month is basically the same model as the one used in the O1-Pro model featured in their new ChatGPT Pro subscription for 10x the price ($200/month, which raised plenty of eyebrows in the developer community); the main difference is that O1-Pro thinks for a lot longer before responding, generating vastly more COT logic tokens, and consuming a far larger amount of inference compute for every response.This is quite striking in that, even a very long and complex prompt for Claude3.5 Sonnet or GPT4o, with ~400kb+ of context given, generally takes less than 10 seconds to begin responding, and often less than 5 seconds. Whereas that same prompt to O1-Pro could easily take 5+ MINUTES before you get a response (although OpenAI does show you some of the "reasoning steps" that are generated during the process while you wait; critically, OpenAI has decided, presumably for trade secret related reasons,to hide from you the exact reasoning tokens it generates, showing you instead a highly abbreviated summary of these).As you can probably imagine, there are tons of contexts where accuracy is paramount— where you'd rather give up and tell the user you can't do it at all rather than give an answer that could be trivially proven wrong or which involves hallucinated facts or otherwise specious reasoning. Anything involving money/transactions, medical stuff, legal stuff, just to name a few.Basically, wherever the cost of inference is trivial relative to the hourly all-in compensation of the human knowledge worker who is interacting with the AI system, that's a case where it become a complete no-brainer to dial up the COT compute (the major drawback is that it increases the latency of responses by a lot, so there are still some contexts where you might prefer to iterate faster by getting lower latency responses that are less accurate or correct).Some of the most exciting news in the AI world came out just a few weeks ago and concerned OpenAI's new unreleased O3 model, which was able to solve a large variety of tasks that were previously deemed to be out of reach of current AI approaches in the near term. And the way it was able to do these hardest problems (which include exceptionally tough "foundational" math problems that would be very hard for even highly skilled professional mathematicians to solve), is that OpenAI threw insane amount of compute resources at the problems— in some cases, spending $3k+ worth of compute power to solve a single task (compare this to traditional inference costs for a single task, which would be unlikely to exceed a couple dollars using regular Transformer models without chain-of-thought).It doesn't take an AI genius to realize that this development creates a new scaling law that is totally independent of the original pre-training scaling law. Now, you still want to train the best model you can by cleverly leveraging as much compute as you can and as many trillion tokens of high quality training data as possible, but that's just the beginning of the story in this new world; now, you could easily use incredibly huge amounts of compute just to do inference from these models at a very high level of confidence or when trying to solve extremely tough problems that require "genius level" reasoning to avoid all the potential pitfalls that would lead a regular LLM astray.But Why Should Nvidia Get to Capture All The Upside?Even if you believe, as I do, that the future prospects for AI are almost unimaginably bright, the question still remains, "Why should one company extract the majority of the profit pool from this technology?" There are certainly many historical cases where a very important new technology changed the world, but the main winners were not the companies that seemed the most promising during the initial stages of the process. The Wright Brothers' airplane company in all its current incarnations across many different firms today isn't worth more than $10b despite them inventing and perfecting the technology well ahead of everyone else. And while Ford has a respectable market cap of $40b today, it's just 1.1% of Nvidia's current market cap.To understand this, it's important to really understand why Nvidia is currently capturing so much of the pie today. After all, they aren't the only company that even makes GPUs. AMD makes respectable GPUs that, on paper, have comparable numbers of transistors, which are made using similar process nodes, etc. Sure, they aren't as fast or as advanced as Nvidia's GPUs, but it's not like the Nvidia GPUs are 10x faster or anything like that. In fact, in terms of naive/raw dollars per FLOP, AMD GPUs are something like half the price of Nvidia GPUs.Looking at other semiconductor markets such as the DRAM market, despite the fact that it is also very highly consolidated with only 3 meaningful global players (Samsung, Micron, SK-Hynix), gross margins in the DRAM market range from negative at the bottom of the cycle to ~60% at the very top of the cycle, with an average in the 20% range. Compare that to Nvidia's overall gross margin in recent quarters of ~75%, which is dragged down by the lower-margin and more commoditized consumer 3D graphics category.So how is this possible? Well, the main reasons have to do with software— better drivers that "just work" on Linux and which are highly battle-tested and reliable (unlike AMD, which is notorious for the low quality and instability of their Linux drivers), and highly optimized open-source code in popular libraries such as PyTorch that has been tuned to work really well on Nvidia GPUs.It goes beyond that though— the very programming framework that coders use to write low-level code that is optimized for GPUs, CUDA, is totally proprietary to Nvidia, and it has become a de facto standard. If you want to hire a bunch of extremely talented programmers who know how to make things go really fast on GPUs, and pay them $650k/year or whatever the going rate is for people with that particular expertise, chances are that they are going to "think" and work in CUDA.Besides software superiority, the other major thing that Nvidia has going for it is what is known as interconnect— essentially, the bandwidth that connects together thousands of GPUs together efficiently so they can be jointly harnessed to train today's leading-edge foundational models. In short, the key to efficient training is to keep all the GPUs as fully utilized as possible all the time— not waiting around idling until they receive the next chunk of data they need to compute the next step of the training process.The bandwidth requirements are extremely high— much, much higher than the typical bandwidth that is needed in traditional data center use cases. You can't really use traditional networking gear or fiber optics for this kind of interconnect, since it would introduce too much latency and wouldn't give you the pure terabytes per second of bandwidth that is needed to keep all the GPUs constantly busy.Nvidia made an incredibly smart decision to purchase the Israeli company Mellanox back in 2019 for a mere $6.9b, and this acquisition is what provided them with their industry leading interconnect technology. Note that interconnect speed is a lot more relevant to the training process, where you have to harness together the output of thousands of GPUs at the same time, than the inference process (including COT inference), which can use just a handful of GPUs— all you need is enough VRAM to store the quantized (compressed) model weights of the already-trained model.So those are arguably the major components of Nvidia's "moat" and how it has been able to maintain such high margins for so long (there is also a "flywheel" aspect to things, where they aggressively invest their super-normal profits into tons of R&D, which in turn helps them improve their tech at a faster rate than the competition, so they are always in the lead in terms of raw performance).But as was pointed out earlier, what customers really tend to care about, all other things being equal, is performance per dollar (both in up-front capex cost of equipment and in energy usage, so performance per watt), and even though Nvidia's GPUs are certainly the fastest, they are not the best price/performance when measured naively in terms of FLOPS.But the thing is, all other things are NOT equal, and the fact that AMD's drivers suck, that popular AI software libraries don't run as well on AMD GPUs, that you can't find really good GPU experts who specialize in AMD GPUs outside of the gaming world (why would they bother when there is more demand in the market for CUDA experts?), that you can't wire thousands of them together as effectively because of lousy interconnect technology for AMD— all this means that AMD is basically not competitive in the high-end data center world, and doesn't seem to have very good prospects for getting there in the near term.Well, that all sounds very bullish for Nvidia, right? Now you can see why the stock is trading at such a huge valuation! But what are the other clouds on the horizon? Well, there are few that I think merit significant attention. Some have been lurking in the background for the last few years, but too small to make a dent considering how quickly the pie has been growing, but where they are getting ready to potentially inflect upwards. Others are very recent developments (as in, the last 2 weeks) that might dramatically change the near-term trajectory of incremental GPU demand.At a very high level, you can think of things like this: Nvidia operated in a pretty niche area for a very long time; they had very limited competition, and the competition wasn't particular profitable or growing fast enough to ever pose a real threat, since they didn't have the capital needed to really apply pressure to a market leader like Nvidia. The gaming market was large and growing, but didn't feature earth shattering margins or particularly fabulous year over year growth rates.A few big tech companies started ramping up hiring and spending on machine learning and AI efforts around 2016-2017, but it was never a truly significant line item for any of them on an aggregate basis— more of a "moonshot" R&D expenditure. But once the big AI race started in earnest with the release of ChatGPT in 2022— only a bit over 2 years ago, although it seems like a lifetime ago in terms of developments— that situation changed very dramatically.Suddenly, big companies were ready to spend many, many billions of dollars incredibly quickly. The number of researchers showing up at the big research conferences like Neurips and ICML went up very, very dramatically. All the smart students who might have previously studied financial derivatives were instead studying Transformers, and $1mm+ compensation packages for non-executive engineering roles (i.e., for independent contributors not managing a team) became the norm at the leading AI labs.It takes a while to change the direction of a massive cruise ship; and even if you move really quickly and spend billions, it takes a year or more to build greenfield data centers and order all the equipment (with ballooning lead times) and get it all set up and working. It takes a long time to hire and onboard even smart coders before they can really hit their stride and familiarize themselves with the existing codebases and infrastructure.But now, you can imagine that absolutely biblical amounts of capital, brainpower, and effort are being expended in this area. And Nvidia has the biggest target of any player on their back, because they are the ones who are making the lion's share of the profits TODAY, not in some hypothetical future where the AI runs our whole lives.So the very high level takeaway is basically that "markets find a way"; they find alternative, radically innovative new approaches to building hardware that leverage completely new ideas to sidestep barriers that help prop up Nvidia's moat.The Hardware Level ThreatFor example, so-called "wafer scale" AI training chips from Cerebras, which dedicate an entire 300mm silicon wafer to an absolutely gargantuan chip that contains orders of magnitude more transistors and cores on a single chip (see this recent blog post from them explaining how they were able to solve the "yield problem" that had been preventing this approach from being economically practical in the past).To put this into perspective, if you compare Cerebras' newest WSE-3 chip to Nvidia's flagship data-center GPU, the H100, the Cerebras chip has a total die area of 46,225 square millimeters compared to just 814 for the H100 (and the H100 is itself considered an enormous chip by industry standards); that's a multiple of ~57x! And instead of having 132 "streaming multiprocessor" cores enabled on the chip like the H100 has, the Cerebras chip has ~900,000 cores (granted, each of these cores is smaller and does a lot less, but it's still an almost unfathomably large number in comparison). In more concrete apples-to-apples terms, the Cerebras chip can do around ~32x the FLOPS in AI contexts as a single H100 chip. Since an H100 sells for close to $40k a pop, you can imagine that the WSE-3 chip isn't cheap.So why does this all matter? Well, instead of trying to battle Nvidia head-on by using a similar approach and trying to match the Mellanox interconnect technology, Cerebras has used a radically innovative approach to do an end-run around the interconnect problem: inter-processor bandwidth becomes much less of an issue when everything is running on the same super-sized chip. You don't even need to have the same level of interconnect because one mega chip replaces tons of H100s.And the Cerebras chips also work extremely well for AI inference tasks. In fact, you can try it today for free here and use Meta's very respectable Llama-3.3-70B model. It responds basically instantaneously, at ~1,500 tokens per second. To put that into perspective, anything above 30 tokens per second feels relatively snappy to users based on comparisons to ChatGPT and Claude, and even 10 tokens per second is fast enough that you can basically read the response while it's being generated.Cerebras is also not alone; there are other companies, like Groq (not to be confused with the Grok model family trained by Elon Musk's X AI). Groq has taken yet another innovative approach to solving the same fundamental problem. Instead of trying to compete with Nvidia's CUDA software stack directly, they've developed what they call a "tensor processing unit" (TPU) that is specifically designed for the exact mathematical operations that deep learning models need to perform. Their chips are designed around a concept called "deterministic compute," which means that, unlike traditional GPUs where the exact timing of operations can vary, their chips execute operations in a completely predictable way every single time.This might sound like a minor technical detail, but it actually makes a massive difference for both chip design and software development. Because the timing is completely deterministic, Groq can optimize their chips in ways that would be impossible with traditional GPU architectures. As a result, they've been demonstrating for the past 6+ months inference speeds of over 500 tokens per second with the Llama series of models and other open source models, far exceeding what's possible with traditional GPU setups. Like Cerebras, this is available today and you can try it for free here.Using a comparable Llama3 model with "speculative decoding," Groq is able to generate 1,320 tokens per second, on par with Cerebras and far in excess of what is possible using regular GPUs. Now, you might ask what the point is of achieving 1,000+ tokens per second when users seem pretty satisfied with ChatGPT, which is operating at less than 10% of that speed. And the thing is, it does matter. It makes it a lot faster to iterate and not lose focus as a human knowledge worker when you get instant feedback. And if you're using the model programmatically via the API, which is increasingly where much of the demand is coming from, then it can enable whole new classes of applications that require multi-stage inference (where the output of previous stages is used as input in successive stages of prompting/inference) or which require low-latency responses, such as content moderation, fraud detection, dynamic pricing, etc.But even more fundamentally, the faster you can serve requests, the faster you can cycle things, and the busier you can keep the hardware. Although Groq's hardware is extremely expensive, clocking in at $2mm to $3mm for a single server, it ends up costing far less per request fulfilled if you have enough demand to keep the hardware busy all the time.And like Nvidia with CUDA, a huge part of Groq's advantage comes from their own proprietary software stack. They are able to take the same open source models that other companies like Meta, DeepSeek, and Mistral develop and release for free, and decompose them in special ways that allow them to run dramatically faster on their specific hardware.Like Cerebras, they have taken different technical decisions to optimize certain particular aspects of the process, which allows them to do things in a fundamentally different way. In Groq's case, it's because they are entirely focused on inference level compute, not on training: all their special sauce hardware and software only give these huge speed and efficiency advantages when doing inference on an already trained model.But if the next big scaling law that people are excited about is for inference level compute— and if the biggest drawback of COT models is the high latency introduced by having to generate all those intermediate logic tokens before they can respond— then even a company that only does inference compute, but which does it dramatically faster and more efficiently than Nvidia can— can introduce a serious competitive threat in the coming years. At the very least, Cerebras and Groq can chip away at the lofty expectations for Nvidia's revenue growth over the next 2-3 years that are embedded in the current equity valuation.Besides these particularly innovative, if relatively unknown, startup competitors, there is some serious competition coming from some of Nvidia's biggest customers themselves who have been making custom silicon that specifically targets AI training and inference workloads. Perhaps the best known of these is Google, which has been developing its own proprietary TPUs since 2016. Interestingly, although it briefly sold TPUs to external customers, Google has been using all its TPUs internally for the past several years, and it is already on its 6th generation of TPU hardware.Amazon has also been developing its own custom chips called Trainium2 and Inferentia2. And while Amazon is building out data centers featuring billions of dollars of Nvidia GPUs, they are also at the same time investing many billions in other data centers that use these internal chips. They have one cluster that they are bringing online for Anthropic that features over 400k chips.Amazon gets a lot of flak for totally bungling their internal AI model development, squandering massive amounts of internal compute resources on models that ultimately are not competitive, but the custom silicon is another matter. Again, they don't necessarily need their chips to be better and faster than Nvidia's. What they need is for their chips to be good enough, but build them at a breakeven gross margin instead of the ~90%+ gross margin that Nvidia earns on its H100 business.OpenAI has also announced their plans to build custom chips, and they (together with Microsoft) are obviously the single largest user of Nvidia's data center hardware. As if that weren't enough, Microsoft have themselves announced their own custom chips!And Apple, the most valuable technology company in the world, has been blowing away expectations for years now with their highly innovative and disruptive custom silicon operation, which now completely trounces the CPUs from both Intel and AMD in terms of performance per watt, which is the most important factor in mobile (phone/tablet/laptop) applications. And they have been making their own internally designed GPUs and "Neural Processors" for years, even though they have yet to really demonstrate the utility of such chips outside of their own custom applications, like the advanced software based image processing used in the iPhone's camera.While Apple's focus seems somewhat orthogonal to these other players in terms of its mobile-first, consumer oriented, "edge compute" focus, if it ends up spending enough money on its new contract with OpenAI to provide AI services to iPhone users, you have to imagine that they have teams looking into making their own custom silicon for inference/training (although given their secrecy, you might never even know about it directly!).Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference?When thinking about all this, you should keep one incredibly important thing in mind: Nvidia is largely an IP based company. They don't make their own chips. The true special sauce for making these incredible devices arguably comes more from TSMC, the actual fab, and ASML, which makes the special EUV lithography machines used by TSMC to make these leading-edge process node chips. And that's critically important, because TSMC will sell their most advanced chips to anyone who comes to them with enough up-front investment and is willing to guarantee a certain amount of volume. They don't care if it's for Bitcoin mining ASICs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile phone SoCs, etc.As much as senior chip designers at Nvidia earn per year, surely some of the best of them could be lured away by these other tech behemoths for enough cash and stock. And once they have a team and resources, they can design innovative chips (again, perhaps not even 50% as advanced as an H100, but with that Nvidia gross margin, there is plenty of room to work with) in 2 to 3 years, and thanks for TSMC, they can turn those into actual silicon using the exact same process node technology as Nvidia.As if these looming hardware threats weren't bad enough, there are a few developments in the software world in the last couple years that, while they started out slowly, are now picking up real steam and could pose a serious threat to the software dominance of Nvidia's CUDA. The first of these is the horrible Linux drivers for AMD GPUs. Remember we talked about how AMD has inexplicably allowed these drivers to suck for years despite leaving massive amounts of money on the table?Well, amusingly enough, the infamous hacker George Hotz (famous for jailbreaking the original iphone as a teenager, and currently the CEO of self-driving startup Comma.ai and AI computer company Tiny Corp, which also makes the open-source tinygrad AI software framework), recently announced that he was sick and tired of dealing with AMD's bad drivers, and desperately wanted to be able to to leverage the lower cost AMD GPUs in their TinyBox AI computers (which come in multiple flavors, some of which use Nvidia GPUs, and some of which use AMD GPUS).Well, he is making his own custom drivers and software stack for AMD GPUs without any help from AMD themselves; on Jan. 15th of 2025, he tweeted via his company's X account that "We are one piece away from a completely sovereign stack on AMD, the RDNA3 assembler. We have our own driver, runtime, libraries, and emulator. (all in ~12,000 lines!)" Given his track record and skills, it is likely that they will have this all working in the next couple months, and this would allow for a lot of exciting possibilities of using AMD GPUs for all sorts of applications where companies currently feel compelled to pay up for Nvidia GPUs.OK, well that's just a driver for AMD, and it's not even done yet. What else is there? Well, there are a few other areas on the software side that are a lot more impactful. For one, there is now a massive concerted effort across many large tech companies and the open source software community at large to make more generic AI software frameworks that have CUDA as just one of many "compilation targets".That is, you write your software using higher-level abstractions, and the system itself can automatically turn those high-level constructs into super well-tuned low-level code that works extremely well on CUDA. But because it's done at this higher level of abstraction, it can just as easily get compiled into low-level code that works extremely well on lots of other GPUs and TPUs from a variety of providers, such as the massive number of custom chips in the pipeline from every big tech company.The most famous examples of these frameworks are MLX (sponsored primarily by Apple), Triton (sponsored primarily by OpenAI), and JAX (developed by Google). MLX is particularly interesting because it provides a PyTorch-like API that can run efficiently on Apple Silicon, showing how these abstraction layers can enable AI workloads to run on completely different architectures. Triton, meanwhile, has become increasingly popular as it allows developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled to run on various hardware targets without having to understand the low-level details of each platform.These frameworks allow developers to write their code once using high powered abstractions and then target tons of platforms automatically— doesn't that sound like a better way to do things, which would give you a lot more flexibility in terms of how you actually run the code?In the 1980s, all the most popular, best selling software was written in hand-tuned assembly language. The PKZIP compression utility for example was hand crafted to maximize speed, to the point where a competently coded version written in the standard C programming language and compiled using the best available optimizing compilers at the time, would run at probably half the speed of the hand-tuned assembly code. The same is true for other popular software packages like WordStar, VisiCalc, and so on.Over time, compilers kept getting better and better, and every time the CPU architectures changed (say, from Intel releasing the 486, then the Pentium, and so on), that hand-rolled assembler would often have to be thrown out and rewritten, something that only the smartest coders were capable of (sort of like how CUDA experts are on a different level in the job market versus a "regular" software developer). Eventually, things converged so that the speed benefits of hand-rolled assembly were outweighed dramatically by the flexibility of being able to write code in a high-level language like C or C++, where you rely on the compiler to make things run really optimally on the given CPU.Nowadays, very little new code is written in assembly. I believe a similar transformation will end up happening for AI training and inference code, for similar reasons: computers are good at optimization, and flexibility and speed of development is increasingly the more important factor— especially if it also allows you to save dramatically on your hardware bill because you don't need to keep paying the "CUDA tax" that gives Nvidia 90%+ margins.Yet another area where you might see things change dramatically is that CUDA might very well end up being more of a high level abstraction itself— a "specification language" similar to Verilog (used as the industry standard to describe chip layouts) that skilled developers can use to describe high-level algorithms that involve massive parallelism (since they are already familiar with it, it's very well constructed, it's the lingua franca, etc.), but then instead of having that code compiled for use on Nvidia GPUs like you would normally do, it can instead be fed as source code into an LLM which can port it into whatever low-level code is understood by the new Cerebras chip, or the new Amazon Trainium2, or the new Google TPUv6, etc. This isn't as far off as you might think; it's probably already well within reach using OpenAI's latest O3 model, and surely will be possible generally within a year or two.Perhaps the most shocking development which was alluded to earlier happened in the last couple of weeks. And that is the news that has totally rocked the AI world, and which has been dominating the discourse among knowledgeable people on Twitter despite its complete absence from any of the mainstream media outlets: that a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek released two new models that have basically world-competitive performance levels on par with the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic (blowing past the Meta Llama3 models and other smaller open source model players such as Mistral). These models are called DeepSeek-V3 (basically their answer to GPT-4o and Claude3.5 Sonnet) and DeepSeek-R1 (basically their answer to OpenAI's O1 model).Why is this all so shocking? Well, first of all, DeepSeek is a tiny Chinese company that reportedly has under 200 employees. The story goes that they started out as a quant trading hedge fund similar to TwoSigma or RenTec, but after Xi Jinping cracked down on that space, they used their math and engineering chops to pivot into AI research. Who knows if any of that is really true or if they are merely some kind of front for the CCP or the Chinese military. But the fact remains that they have released two incredibly detailed technical reports, for DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeekR1.These are heavy technical reports, and if you don't know a lot of linear algebra, you probably won't understand much. But what you should really try is to download the free DeepSeek app on the AppStore here and install it using a Google account to log in and give it a try (you can also install it on Android here), or simply try it out on your desktop computer in the browser here. Make sure to select the "DeepThink" option to enable chain-of-thought (the R1 model) and ask it to explain parts of the technical reports in simple terms.This will simultaneously show you a few important things:One, this model is absolutely legit. There is a lot of BS that goes on with AI benchmarks, which are routinely gamed so that models appear to perform great on the benchmarks but then suck in real world tests. Google is certainly the worst offender in this regard, constantly crowing about how amazing their LLMs are, when they are so awful in any real world test that they can't even reliably accomplish the simplest possible tasks, let alone challenging coding tasks. These DeepSeek models are not like that— the responses are coherent, compelling, and absolutely on the same level as those from OpenAI and Anthropic.Two, that DeepSeek has made profound advancements not just in model quality, but more importantly in model training and inference efficiency. By being extremely close to the hardware and by layering together a handful of distinct, very clever optimizations, DeepSeek was able to train these incredible models using GPUs in a dramatically more efficient way. By some measurements, over ~45x more efficiently than other leading-edge models. DeepSeek claims that the complete cost to train DeepSeek-V3 was just over $5mm. That is absolutely nothing by the standards of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., which were well into the $100mm+ level for training costs for a single model as early as 2024.How in the world could this be possible? How could this little Chinese company completely upstage all the smartest minds at our leading AI labs, which have 100 times more resources, headcount, payroll, capital, GPUs, etc? Wasn't China supposed to be crippled by Biden's restriction on GPU exports? Well, the details are fairly technical, but we can at least describe them at a high level. It might have just turned out that the relative GPU processing poverty of DeepSeek was the critical ingredient to make them more creative and clever, necessity being the mother of invention and all.A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. Most Western AI labs train using "full precision" 32-bit numbers (this basically specifies the number of gradations possible in describing the output of an artificial neuron; 8 bits in FP8 lets you store a much wider range of numbers than you might expect— it's not just limited to 256 different equal-sized magnitudes like you'd get with regular integers, but instead uses clever math tricks to store both very small and very large numbers— though naturally with less precision than you'd get with 32 bits.) The main tradeoff is that while FP32 can store numbers with incredible precision across an enormous range, FP8 sacrifices some of that precision to save memory and boost performance, while still maintaining enough accuracy for many AI workloads.DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall.Another major breakthrough is their multi-token prediction system. Most Transformer based LLM models do inference by predicting the next token— one token at a time. DeepSeek figured out how to predict multiple tokens while maintaining the quality you'd get from single-token prediction. Their approach achieves about 85-90% accuracy on these additional token predictions, which effectively doubles inference speed without sacrificing much quality. The clever part is they maintain the complete causal chain of predictions, so the model isn't just guessing— it's making structured, contextual predictions.One of their most innovative developments is what they call Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). This is a breakthrough in how they handle what are called the Key-Value indices, which are basically how individual tokens are represented in the attention mechanism within the Transformer architecture. Although this is getting a bit too advanced in technical terms, suffice it to say that these KV indices are some of the major uses of VRAM during the training and inference process, and part of the reason why you need to use thousands of GPUs at the same time to train these models— each GPU has a maximum of 96 gb of VRAM, and these indices eat that memory up for breakfast.Their MLA system finds a way to store a compressed version of these indices that captures the essential information while using far less memory. The brilliant part is this compression is built directly into how the model learns— it's not some separate step they need to do, it's built directly into the end-to-end training pipeline. This means that the entire mechanism is "differentiable" and able to be trained directly using the standard optimizers. All this stuff works because these models are ultimately finding much lower-dimensional representations of the underlying data than the so-called "ambient dimensions". So it's wasteful to store the full KV indices, even though that is basically what everyone else does.Not only do you end up wasting tons of space by storing way more numbers than you need, which gives a massive boost to the training memory footprint and efficiency (again, slashing the number of GPUs you need to train a world class model), but it can actually end up improving model quality because it can act like a "regularizer," forcing the model to pay attention to the truly important stuff instead of using the wasted capacity to fit to noise in the training data. So not only do you save a ton of memory, but the model might even perform better. At the very least, you don't get a massive hit to performance in exchange for the huge memory savings, which is generally the kind of tradeoff you are faced with in AI training.They also made major advances in GPU communication efficiency through their DualPipe algorithm and custom communication kernels. This system intelligently overlaps computation and communication, carefully balancing GPU resources between these tasks. They only need about 20 of their GPUs' streaming multiprocessors (SMs) for communication, leaving the rest free for computation. The result is much higher GPU utilization than typical training setups achieve.Another very smart thing they did is to use what is known as a Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Transformer architecture, but with key innovations around load balancing. As you might know, the size or capacity of an AI model is often measured in terms of the number of parameters the model contains. A parameter is just a number that stores some attribute of the model; either the "weight" or importance a particular artificial neuron has relative to another one, or the importance of a particular token depending on its context (in the "attention mechanism"), etc.Meta's latest Llama3 models come in a few sizes, for example: a 1 billion parameter version (the smallest), a 70B parameter model (the most commonly deployed one), and even a massive 405B parameter model. This largest model is of limited utility for most users because you would need to have tens of thousands of dollars worth of GPUs in your computer just to run at tolerable speeds for inference, at least if you deployed it in the naive full-precision version. Therefore most of the real-world usage and excitement surrounding these open source models is at the 8B parameter or highly quantized 70B parameter level, since that's what can fit in a consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPU, which you can buy now for under $1,000.So why does any of this matter? Well, in a sense, the parameter count and precision tells you something about how much raw information or data the model has stored internally. Note that I'm not talking about reasoning ability, or the model's "IQ" if you will: it turns out that models with even surprisingly modest parameter counts can show remarkable cognitive performance when it comes to solving complex logic problems, proving theorems in plane geometry, SAT math problems, etc.But those small models aren't going to be able to necessarily tell you every aspect of every plot twist in every single novel by Stendhal, whereas the really big models can potentially do that. The "cost" of that extreme level of knowledge is that the models become very unwieldy both to train and to do inference on, because you always need to store every single one of those 405B parameters (or whatever the parameter count is) in the GPU's VRAM at the same time in order to do any inference with the model.The beauty of the MOE model approach is that you can decompose the big model into a collection of smaller models that each know different, non-overlapping (at least fully) pieces of knowledge. DeepSeek's innovation here was developing what they call an "auxiliary-loss-free" load balancing strategy that maintains efficient expert utilization without the usual performance degradation that comes from load balancing. Then, depending on the nature of the inference request, you can intelligently route the inference to the "expert" models within that collection of smaller models that are most able to answer that question or solve that task.You can loosely think of it as being a committee of experts who have their own specialized knowledge domains: one might be a legal expert, the other a computer science expert, the other a business strategy expert. So if a question comes in about linear algebra, you don't give it to the legal expert. This is of course a very loose analogy and it doesn't actually work like this in practice.The real advantage of this approach is that it allows the model to contain a huge amount of knowledge without being very unwieldy, because even though the aggregate number of parameters is high across all the experts, only a small subset of these parameters is "active" at any given time, which means that you only need to store this small subset of weights in VRAM in order to do inference. In the case of DeepSeek-V3, they have an absolutely massive MOE model with 671B parameters, so it's much bigger than even the largest Llama3 model, but only 37B of these parameters are active at any given time— enough to fit in the VRAM of two consumer-grade Nvidia 4090 GPUs (under $2,000 total cost), rather than requiring one or more H100 GPUs which cost something like $40k each.It's rumored that both ChatGPT and Claude use an MoE architecture, with some leaks suggesting that GPT-4 had a total of 1.8 trillion parameters split across 8 models containing 220 billion parameters each. Despite that being a lot more doable than trying to fit all 1.8 trillion parameters in VRAM, it still requires multiple H100-grade GPUs just to run the model because of the massive amount of memory used.Beyond what has already been described, the technical papers mention several other key optimizations. These include their extremely memory-efficient training framework that avoids tensor parallelism, recomputes certain operations during backpropagation instead of storing them, and shares parameters between the main model and auxiliary prediction modules. The sum total of all these innovations, when layered together, has led to the ~45x efficiency improvement numbers that have been tossed around online, and I am perfectly willing to believe these are in the right ballpark.One very strong indicator that it's true is the cost of DeepSeek's API: despite this nearly best-in-class model performance, DeepSeek charges something like 95% less money for inference requests via its API than comparable models from OpenAI and Anthropic. In a sense, it's sort of like comparing Nvidia's GPUs to the new custom chips from competitors: even if they aren't quite as good, the value for money is so much better that it can still be a no-brainer depending on the application, as long as you can qualify the performance level and prove that it's good enough for your requirements and the API availability and latency is good enough (thus far, people have been amazed at how well DeepSeek's infrastructure has held up despite the truly incredible surge of demand owing to the performance of these new models).But unlike the case of Nvidia, where the cost differential is the result of them earning monopoly gross margins of 90%+ on their data-center products, the cost differential of the DeepSeek API relative to the OpenAI and Anthropic API could be simply that they are nearly 50x more compute efficient (it might even be significantly more than that on the inference side— the ~45x efficiency was on the training side). Indeed, it's not even clear that OpenAI and Anthropic are making great margins on their API services— they might be more interested in revenue growth and gathering more data from analyzing all the API requests they receive.Before moving on, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that many people are speculating that DeepSeek is simply lying about the number of GPUs and GPU hours spent training these models because they actually possess far more H100s than they are supposed to have given the export restrictions on these cards, and they don't want to cause trouble for themselves or hurt their chances of acquiring more of these cards. While it's certainly possible, I think it's more likely that they are telling the truth, and that they have simply been able to achieve these incredible results by being extremely clever and creative in their approach to training and inference. They explain how they are doing things, and I suspect that it's only a matter of time before their results are widely replicated and confirmed by other researchers at various other labs.A Model That Can Really ThinkThe newer R1 model and technical report might even be even more mind blowing, since they were able to beat Anthropic to Chain-of-thought and now are basically the only ones besides OpenAI who have made this technology work at scale. But note that the O1 preview model was only released by OpenAI in mid-September of 2024. That's only ~4 months ago! Something you absolutely must keep in mind is that, unlike OpenAI, which is incredibly secretive about how these models really work at a low level, and won't release the actual model weights to anyone besides partners like Microsoft and other who sign heavy-duty NDAs, these DeepSeek models are both completely open-source and permissively licensed. They have released extremely detailed technical reports explaining how they work, as well as the code that anyone can look at and try to copy.With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems.The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried.What's particularly fascinating is that during training, they observed what they called an "aha moment," a phase where the model spontaneously learned to revise its thinking process mid-stream when encountering uncertainty. This emergent behavior wasn't explicitly programmed; it arose naturally from the interaction between the model and the reinforcement learning environment. The model would literally stop itself, flag potential issues in its reasoning, and restart with a different approach, all without being explicitly trained to do this.The full R1 model built on these insights by introducing what they call "cold-start" data— a small set of high-quality examples— before applying their RL techniques. They also solved one of the major challenges in reasoning models: language consistency. Previous attempts at chain-of-thought reasoning often resulted in models mixing languages or producing incoherent outputs. DeepSeek solved this through a clever language consistency reward during RL training, trading off a small performance hit for much more readable and consistent outputs.The results are mind-boggling: on AIME 2024, one of the most challenging high school math competitions, R1 achieved 79.8% accuracy, matching OpenAI's O1 model. On MATH-500, it hit 97.3%, and it achieved the 96.3 percentile on Codeforces programming competitions. But perhaps most impressively, they managed to distill these capabilities down to much smaller models: their 14B parameter version outperforms many models several times its size, suggesting that reasoning ability isn't just about raw parameter count but about how you train the model to process information.The recent scuttlebutt on Twitter and Blind (a corporate rumor website) is that these models caught Meta completely off guard and that they perform better than the new Llama4 models which are still being trained. Apparently, the Llama project within Meta has attracted a lot of attention internally from high-ranking technical executives, and as a result they have something like 13 individuals working on the Llama stuff who each individually earn more per year in total compensation than the combined training cost for the DeepSeek-V3 models which outperform it. How do you explain that to Zuck with a straight face? How does Zuck keep smiling while shoveling multiple billions of dollars to Nvidia to buy 100k H100s when a better model was trained using just 2k H100s for a bit over $5mm?But you better believe that Meta and every other big AI lab is taking these DeepSeek models apart, studying every word in those technical reports and every line of the open source code they released, trying desperately to integrate these same tricks and optimizations into their own training and inference pipelines. So what's the impact of all that? Well, naively it sort of seems like the aggregate demand for training and inference compute should be divided by some big number. Maybe not by 45, but maybe by 25 or even 30? Because whatever you thought you needed before these model releases, it's now a lot less.Now, an optimist might say "You are talking about a mere constant of proportionality, a single multiple. When you're dealing with an exponential growth curve, that stuff gets washed out so quickly that it doesn't end up matter all that much." And there is some truth to that: if AI really is as transformational as I expect, if the real-world utility of this tech is measured in the trillions, if inference-time compute is the new scaling law of the land, if we are going to have armies of humanoid robots running around doing massive amounts of inference constantly, then maybe the growth curve is still so steep and extreme, and Nvidia has a big enough lead, that it will still work out.But Nvidia is pricing in a LOT of good news in the coming years for that valuation to make sense, and when you start layering all these things together into a total mosaic, it starts to make me at least feel extremely uneasy about spending ~20x the 2025 estimated sales for their shares. What happens if you even see a slight moderation in sales growth? What if it turns out to be 85% instead of over 100%? What if gross margins come in a bit from 75% to 70%— still ridiculously high for a semiconductor company?At a high level, NVIDIA faces an unprecedented convergence of competitive threats that make its premium valuation increasingly difficult to justify at 20x forward sales and 75% gross margins. The company's supposed moats in hardware, software, and efficiency are all showing concerning cracks. The whole world— thousands of the smartest people on the planet, backed by untold billions of dollars of capital resources— are trying to assail them from every angle.On the hardware front, innovative architectures from Cerebras and Groq demonstrate that NVIDIA's interconnect advantage— a cornerstone of its data center dominance— can be circumvented through radical redesigns. Cerebras' wafer-scale chips and Groq's deterministic compute approach deliver compelling performance without needing NVIDIA's complex interconnect solutions. More traditionally, every major NVIDIA customer (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple) is developing custom silicon that could chip away at high-margin data center revenue. These aren't experimental projects anymore— Amazon alone is building out massive infrastructure with over 400,000 custom chips for Anthropic.The software moat appears equally vulnerable. New high-level frameworks like MLX, Triton, and JAX are abstracting away CUDA's importance, while efforts to improve AMD drivers could unlock much cheaper hardware alternatives. The trend toward higher-level abstractions mirrors how assembly language gave way to C/C++, suggesting CUDA's dominance may be more temporary than assumed. Most importantly, we're seeing the emergence of LLM-powered code translation that could automatically port CUDA code to run on any hardware target, potentially eliminating one of NVIDIA's strongest lock-in effects.Perhaps most devastating is DeepSeek's recent efficiency breakthrough, achieving comparable model performance at approximately 1/45th the compute cost. This suggests the entire industry has been massively over-provisioning compute resources. Combined with the emergence of more efficient inference architectures through chain-of-thought models, the aggregate demand for compute could be significantly lower than current projections assume. The economics here are compelling: when DeepSeek can match GPT-4 level performance while charging 95% less for API calls, it suggests either NVIDIA's customers are burning cash unnecessarily or margins must come down dramatically.The fact that TSMC will manufacture competitive chips for any well-funded customer puts a natural ceiling on NVIDIA's architectural advantages. But more fundamentally, history shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits. When layered together, these threats suggest NVIDIA faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies. With five distinct vectors of attack— architectural innovation, customer vertical integration, software abstraction, efficiency breakthroughs, and manufacturing democratization— the probability that at least one succeeds in meaningfully impacting NVIDIA's margins or growth rate seems high. At current valuations, the market isn't pricing in any of these risks.I hope you enjoyed reading this article.

ABSTRACT
What are the characteristics of a good software engineer? It's a topic many people would argue endlessly about. This is not surprising given we are effectively living in the era of software alchemy. Some of the best programmers draw on strong scientific and engineering background and combine this with craft like coding skills in a virtuous feedback cycle.

In this talk we explore the individual practices and techniques that can help bring out the engineer in you.

Nothing but NATS - Going Beyond Cloud Native - Byron Ruth & Kevin Hoffman, Synadia

These days building so-called cloud-native apps involves assembling a custom stack of tools 10x bigger than the app we're building. Additionally, applications increasingly need to expand out to the edge and cloud-native stacks simply don't work in those environments. Fortunately with NATS, we don't need a stack. In this session you'll see how we can leverage compute, storage, and connectivity to build cloud-to-edge native apps more powerful than ever, with less code, effort, and frustration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Retro Biosciences, backed by Sam Altman, is raising $1 billion to extend human lifespan</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/retro-biosciences-backed-by-sam-altman-is-raising-1-billion-to-extend-human-lifespan/</link><author>Charles Rollet</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 23:24:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sam Altman-backed Retro Biosciences is raising $1 billion to develop drugs that extend human lifespan by 10 years, the FT reports.© 2024 TechCrunch.

We’ve worked a lot with Chrome headless at our previous company, scraping millions of web pages per day. While it’s powerful, it’s also heavy on CPU and memory usage. For scraping at scale, building AI agents, or automating websites, the overheads are high. So we asked ourselves: what if we built a browser that only did what’s absolutely necessary for headless automation?Our browser is made of the following main components:- an HTML parser and DOM tree (based on Netsurf libs)- a Javascript runtime (v8)- partial web APIs support (currently DOM and XHR/Fetch)- and a CDP (Chrome Debug Protocol) server to allow plug & play connection with existing scripts (Puppeteer, Playwright, etc).The main idea is to avoid any graphical rendering and just work with data manipulation, which in our experience covers a wide range of headless use cases (excluding some, like screenshot generation).In our current test case Lightpanda is roughly 10x faster than Chrome headless while using 10x less memory.It's a work in progress, there are hundreds of Web APIs, and for now we just support some of them. It's a beta version, so expect most websites to fail or crash. The plan is to increase coverage over time.We chose Zig for its seamless integration with C libs and its  feature that allow us to generate bi-directional Native to JS APIs (see our zig-js-runtime lib https://github.com/lightpanda-io/zig-js-runtime). And of course for its performance :)As a company, our business model is based on a Managed Cloud, browser as a service. Currently, this is primarily powered by Chrome, but as we integrate more web APIs it will gradually transition to Lightpanda.We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Where should we focus our efforts next to support your use cases?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Onit – Source-available ChatGPT Desktop with local mode, Claude, Gemini</title><link>https://github.com/synth-inc/onit</link><author>telenardo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:15:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey Hackernews- it’s Tim Lenardo and I’m launching v1 of Onit today!Onit is ChatGPT Desktop, but with local mode and support for other model providers (Anthropic, GoogleAI, etc). It's also like Cursor Chat, but everywhere on your computer - not just in your IDE!Onit is open-source! You can download a pre-built version from our website: 
www.getonit.aiWe built this because we believe:
Universal Access: AI assistants should be accessible from anywhere on my computer, not just in the browser or in specific apps
Provider Freedom: Consumers should have the choice between providers (anthropic, openAI, etc.) not be locked into a single one (ChatGPT desktop only has OpenAI models)
Local first: AI is more useful with access to your data. But that doesn't count for much if you have to upload personal files to an untrusted server. Onit will always provide options for local processing. No personal data leaves your computer without approval
Customizability: Onit is your assistant. You should be able to configure it to your liking
Extensibility: Onit should allow the community to build and share extensions, making it more useful for everyone.The features for V1 include:
 Local mode - chat with any model running locally on Ollama! No internet connection required
 Multi-provider support - Top models for OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and GoogleAI
 File upload - add images or files for context (bonus: Drag & drop works too!)
 History - revisit prior chats through the history view or with a simple up/down arrow shortcut
 Customizable Shortcut - you pick your hotkey to launch the chat window. (Command+zero by default)What data are you collecting?
Onit V1 does not have a server. Local requests are handled locally, and remote requests are sent to model providers directly from the client. We collect crash reports through Firebase and a single "chat sent" event through PostHog analytics. We don't store your prompts or responses.How to does Onit support local mode? 
For use local mode, run Ollama. You can get Ollama here: https://ollama.com/ 
Onit gets a list of your local models through Ollama’s API.Which models do you support? 
For remote models, Onit V1 supports Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI and GoogleAI. Default models include (o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o, Claude3.5 Sonnet, Claude3.5 Haiku, Gemini 2.0, Grok 2, Grok 2 Vision).
For local mode, Onit supports any models you can run locally on Ollama!What license is Onit under? 
We’re releasing V1 available on a Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. We believe the transparency of open-source is critical. We also want to make sure individuals can customize Onit to their needs (please submit PRs!). However, we don’t want people to sell the code as their own.Where is the monetization?
We’re not monetizing V1. In the future we may add paid premium features. Local chat will- of course- always remain free. If you disagree with a monetized feature, you can always build from source!Why not Linux or Windows? 
Gotta start somewhere! If the reception is positive, we’ll work hard to add further support.Who are we? 
We are Synth, Inc, a small team of developers in San Francisco building at the frontier of AI progress. Other projects include Checkbin (www.checkbin.dev) and Alias (deprecated - www.alias.inc).We’d love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out at contact@getonit dot ai.Future roadmap includes:
 Autocontext - automatically pull context from computer, rather than having to repeatedly upload. 
 Local-RAG - let users index and create context from their files without uploading anything. 
 Local-typeahead - i.e. Cursor Tab but for everywhere
 Additional support - add Linux/Windows, Mistral/Deepseek etc etc.
 (maybe) Bundle Ollama to avoid double-download
 And lot’s more!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Simple Diagram That Will Change How You See Space and Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT1QSi8y56k</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BT1QSi8y56k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Third Episode in our series on the Theory of Everything, we're exploring the simultaneity of your past, present and future.

She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family’s fate played no role in her life.

But when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. 

Eva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. 

Her mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva’s young life.

During her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.

But a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. 

Later in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

// Bio

‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible. The Judeo-Christian scriptures tell of a future time when all things shall be made new. What could this mean? Does ‘all’ include the entire cosmos? Multiple universes, if there are such? Could such an ancient vision ever make sense? Believers say, “It’s God’s mystery.” They should say more.

ABSTRACT
Aaron is at the forefront of shaping the standards that govern online authentication. In this session, Aaron will share his insights into the evolving landscape of identity and access management, highlighting key trends, challenges, and best practices. Drawing on his experience as the editor of OAuth 2.1 and other specifications, Aaron will discuss the future of OAuth and its impact on developers and security professionals.

This session will cover everything from the origins of OAuth to protect users from having to share their credentials with third-party apps, to modern-day uses of OAuth ranging everywhere from advanced token exchange use cases to being the underpinnings of secure identity in the enterprise. Expect takeaways on securing applications at scale and understanding the next generation of identity protocols. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Tod Golding, author of "Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) ", discusses the critical need for collaboration between business and technical roles in organizations adopting a SaaS model with Bill Tarr. He advocates for a top-down vision that encourages non-technical roles, such as finance and operations, to engage deeply with technical teams, fostering a service mindset rather than a sole focus on product features.

Tod highlights the importance of operational insights in multi-tenant environments, where effective monitoring of tenant behaviors is essential to prevent issues before they impact customers. He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.

Looking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.

Multi-Zone Clusters Inside and Out - Tom Dean & Phil Henderson, Buoyant

Multi-zone clusters are a great tool for improving application reliability — and also a great way to spend a ton of cash. Why? What really happens when you set these things up? How do you use them effectively without bankrupting your whole organization? In this session, we'll dig into the nuts and bolts of what goes on under the hood of a multi-zone cluster, including what a zone is, what Kubernetes understands about zones, how zones affect routing, and why multi-zone clusters can drive costs up. We'll spend some time on Kubernetes' Topology Aware Routing, covering its advantages as well as its very real limitations. Finally, we'll dive into how you can influence Kubernetes' choices to take advantage of multi-zone clusters' reliability while containing costs. Join us for learning and live demos!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Goodbye etcd!

Goodbye etcd! Running Kubernetes on Distributed PostgreSQL - Denis Magda, Yugabyte

Kubernetes once favored Etcd as a database for all cluster data. Back then, relational databases lacked the availability and scalability characteristics required by Kubernetes. However, as Etcd encountered challenges with various Kubernetes workloads, relational databases continued to evolve. This session is a practical guide for deploying fault-tolerant and scalable Kubernetes clusters on distributed PostgreSQL. We’ll begin with Kine, which integrates into the Kubernetes architecture, enabling relational databases for cluster metadata management. Then, we’ll use Kine to deploy Kubernetes on a single-server PostgreSQL instance. After that, we’ll migrate to a multi-node PostgreSQL instance, allowing Kubernetes to tolerate zone and region outages and scale to thousands of nodes on demand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Oracle Linux 10 Developer Preview Released With UEK-Next Based On Linux 6.12</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Oracle-Linux-10-DP</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 01:33:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building off last month's release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.0 beta, Oracle today published the Oracle Linux 10 Developer Preview for a first glimpse at this next RHEL10-derived operating system...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Epic Games To Cover Developer iOS Fees</title><link>https://games.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2350253/epic-games-to-cover-developer-ios-fees?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Epic Games is expanding its mobile app store to include nearly 20 third-party games on Android and EU iOS, launching a free games program, and temporarily covering Apple's Core Technology Fee for participating developers to counter platform restrictions. "Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores in different places, but to build a single, cross-platform store in which, within the era of multi-platform games, if you buy a game or digital items in one place, you have the ability to own them everywhere," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters during a press briefing. The Verge reports: Under the program, Epic will offer new free games in the store each month before eventually switching to a weekly schedule. However, the games aren't actually in the store yet -- Epic said on Thursday that it "ran into a few bugs that we're working through now" and "we'll provide an update once the games are live and ready to play!"
 
To sweeten the deal for developers that participate in the free games program on iOS, Epic will help defray the cost of using third-party marketplaces. For one year, it will pay these developers' Core Technology Fee (CTF): a 50 euro cent fee levied on every install of an iOS app that uses third-party stores after it exceeds 1 million annual downloads. (Apple gives developers with less than 10 million euros in global revenue a three-year on-ramp.) [...] Epic writes in its blog post that covering the fee "is not financially viable for every third party app store or for Epic long term, but we'll do it while the European Commission investigates Apple's non-compliance with the law."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Efficient LLM Deployment: A Unified Approach with Ray, VLLM, and Kubernetes - Lily (Xiaoxuan) Liu</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3NW-gV1OtA</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/K3NW-gV1OtA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:59:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Adds Support For The Microsoft Copilot Key Found On New Laptops</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2333254/linux-614-adds-support-for-the-microsoft-copilot-key-found-on-new-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.14 kernel now maps out support for Microsoft's "Copilot" key "so that user-space software can determine the behavior for handling that key's action on the Linux desktop," writes Phoronix's Michael Larabel.

Kubernetes SIG Storage: Intro & Deep Dive - Michelle Au, Google; Xing Yang, VMware by Broadcom; Hemant Kumar, Red Hat

Kubernetes SIG Storage is responsible for ensuring that different types of file and block storage are available wherever a container is scheduled, storage capacity management (container ephemeral storage usage, volume resizing, etc.), influencing scheduling of containers based on storage (data gravity, availability, etc.), and generic operations on storage (snapshotting, etc.). SIG Storage also has a project that provides APIs for object storage support in Kubernetes. In this session, we will deep dive into some projects that SIG Storage is currently working on, provide an update on the current status, and discuss what might be coming in the future.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SIG-Node: Intro and Deep Dive - Sergey Kanzhelev &amp; Dawn Chen, Google; Mrunal Patel, Red Hat</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb0Op1G6XjQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bb0Op1G6XjQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:12:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumen Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why So Many Ancient Civilizations Collapsed At The Same Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8YQuyjWks</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1l8YQuyjWks?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bronze Age collapse is perhaps one of the greatest disasters in human history and also one of the least understood.

Unless of course cosmologists blundered and dark energy doesn't even exist. Then it's back to the drawing board.

I'm one of the lead devs of this project at fal.ai and we created an open source lightweight video editor powered by the latest media AI models. The main goal was to tackle some challenges when dealing with complex media handling and encoding on the browser.It all started as an internal experiment but as we tackled some of the issues it was clear there could be some value sharing it with the open source community.Some of the key points and tech stack details:- It uses IndexedDb, so all data is local (i.e. no auth, no cloud db)- Multiple AI models for video, image, music and voice-over. APIs are provided by fal.ai- Built with the typical React+Next.js, Shadcn front-end- Used remotion.dev for the realtime video preview (this is such a great project, without it the codebase would be twice as large)- File uploads so you can bring your own media by uploadthing.com- ffmpeg for encoding the final video and also some ui tricks, like the audio waveformWe deployed a version of it and for now it's free to use. We do plan to add some rate limiting and a bring your own API Key next, but it's open source and I'm curious about what the community will build on top of it, or derive from it. Customize your own video app and if you do, please share.If you have any questions, hit me up!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Llama.vim – Local LLM-assisted text completion</title><link>https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.vim</link><author>kgwgk</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 18:06:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Operator research preview</title><link>https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 18:03:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2261 - Warren Smith</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7Hrq8WL1-g</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/m7Hrq8WL1-g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Warren Smith is an educator and founder of the Secret Scholars on YouTube.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

Combine this with parametric design, and it makes iteration and customisation a breeze. My flagship example is my recent speaker project.With the previous speaker project I was literally at the margins for the largest speaker I could comfortably make with my 3D printer – without significantly more work splitting up the design. I was looking to see what large format printers were out there – there are a handful but they’re expensive and possibly not as capable as what I have now.Then I happened to watch a video where Richard from RMC 3D prints an entire arcade machine using a farm of relatively small printers. After creating the model,  he split it into macro layers, each of which where split into smaller parts that had a dovetail slot for assembly. It apparently worked really well.What if I could automate this process?In the last article about speaker design I mention the possibility of floor-standing speakers, glossing over the fact that I’d have to segment the print. If I constrained the system to work on panel-type designs such as this speaker system, it would be quite straightforward to implement.I already wrote a system to place the parts nested on individual beds; I decided to adapt that code to also be able to split up panels into a what is effectively a jigsaw. I could use dovetail joins to do this, allowing something that can be easily glued and requiring no extra parts like dowels.If I got it right, it would divide the parts through complex geometry without a significant impact on the final finish.Dovetail joins are a traditional way to join wood together. They’re generally used for strength, but also aesthetics. They can be manually cut, or made using a handheld router (using a jig) or CNC router.The strength comes from the tightening/wedging effect when pulling the join apart. If the dovetail is tapered, the join can also tighten when it aligns too – this is highly desirable for gluing, as it means the glue will not be scraped away.I took a look at some dovetail implementations in OpenSCAD, but none had all the features I needed.I desired an approach that would subtract plastic once such that we end up with a fully mated join straight away. In theory this would simplify the design such that the two parts don’t need 2 separate, complicated and overlapping negatives to subtract.This calls for a thin “shell” type structure, like a zig-zagging ribbon; even better it should be tapered!OpenSCAD, being CSG based is not well suited to creating thin shells, so this can be a bit awkward to do.Here is the deconstruction of the dovetail profile, after a few iterations to remove artefacts and optimise.Interestingly, step 8 was originally done as an intersection, but I found that it absolutely destroyed OpenSCAD performance. You’re talking one frame every few minutes instead of dozens per second!I didn’t remove the interfering edges at first – see the hanging artefacts screenshot later on. I was confused and thought it was a bug at first, until I examined the 3D tooth again.Here’s the code that does exactly what you see above, complete with annotations to show what step corresponds to what. Only 68 lines!DownloadCopyI made several test prints to find what felt like the right set of parameters for the ratios described above. I settled on quite a small tooth, as it would reduce the size of any artefacts produced. Plus, the fit felt tighter.In case you’re wondering, I found the 0.2mm interference fit that Richard used in the video worked best, leaving a bit of play and somewhere for the glue to go.Performance was kept in check by limiting the number of faces () in the tooth code. This was a good compromise, smooth enough and reduces stress concentration sufficiently.I am a little concerned about the Z-fighting hat occurs when the parts are joined. Usually I make sure the parts intersect a little to avoid this. It looks fine, I’ll just hope I don’t have any manifolding issues later on for now.Sometimes the top part of a tapered tooth can be suspended in mid-air – this occurs when a boundary occurs at a tooth edge. This is a problem as it will cause spaghetti when printing, not to mention missing chunks in the final design.I realised I could at least detect and remove these artefacts in the (post-processing) code by looking for independent tiny fragments that aren’t touching the bed. I can at least then prevent the spaghetti; there will still be a hole in the design but I presume most of the time that can be addressed in the finishing step.Automatically splitting up STLsNow that I had geometry to create the joins in-place, I needed to automate the process so I can cut up an arbitrary design to fit on a given printer.As I’ve mentioned, this only has to work on panels so I have the luxury of only having to operate in 2D and assume the parts are mainly flat and rectangular.To automate it, I figured it would be far easier to do this (mostly) outside of OpenSCAD and operate on STLs directly. That way this system will work on 3D printed models from any CAD software.I have already developed some part nesting software using rectpack and numpy-stl, so I decided to use that as a base.The resulting code is straightforward. Here’s how it works:Load the STL file and find the bounding box of the modelRotate it so the aspect ratio matches the bed of the printer (and optionally, so the design is at its longest along the same axis as the printer bed)Calculate how m any sub-divisions are necessary on each axis to produce parts that will fit on the bed (margin of tooth size required)Execute an OpenSCAD template that will subtract the dovetail teeth from the model, translating the STL so each cut is in the right placeSplit those STLs into separate files with  cliRemove any edge artefacts by looking for small objectsI refactored by nesting code to allow adding the dovetail splitting code without causing a mess. After a lot of debugging I ran the code, only to be disappointed! It took 4 hours to run per operation, only to fail with these errors:ERROR: CGAL error in CGALUtils::applyBinaryOperator difference: CGAL ERROR: assertion violation!ERROR: The given mesh is not closed! Unable to convert to CGAL_Nef_PolyhedronOpenSCAD uses the CGAL library which is notoriously slow, and it can produce non-manifold meshes. The speaker design I made produces non-manifold STLs – I think they have holes in due to some OpenSCAD implementation issues, or something with my code.Those errors above are likely to be caused by these non-manifold edges. What could I do? I didn’t want to get this far only to abandon the project. Luckily, recently OpenSCAD has integrated a new geometry library called manifold which is apparently several orders of magnitude faster and more robust.I tried this using an unstable version of OpenSCAD with the  flag, and it worked! Not only did it work, but it computed the design in  This is 64500x improvement (and it works).I should try manifold with the rest of the design. Manifold seems to use more memory and is multi-threaded, so I’d have to modify my build scripts which currently build 16 parts at once – last time I tried it overwhelmed the system.Anyway, after an evening of more hacking I got it properly integrated and behaving as expected. Here’s the previous speaker design with a bed size reduced to 200x200 – this means it could be printed on a Prusa i3!It seems to have worked exceptionally well. I like how the nesting algorithm has placed the split parts together as well to reduce required beds. This will decrease total printing time and effort. In one case (bed 17) the part did not fit in one bed, but was split so it could be.Looking at the corners, it seems quite common for the above to occur. As we know where the intersections of dovetail joins are, we could skip teeth to avoid the issue. That’s for another day though.I’ve linked the code above. It expects , ,  and , as well as the dovetail.scad to be in . I hacked it from 2 files, so it might need a few fixes to work.The chosen profile is self-aligning, and increases the surface area for glue to bond. It’s easy to align against a straight edge if a silicone mat is used to prevent the glue from sticking to things it shouldn’t.This has successfully unlocked a floor-standing speaker design using this method in the near future, after validating the design and experimenting with different adhesives and finishes. Or, perhaps I will repackage my small MDF subwoofer I built a few years ago.I could have implemented this as part of the speaker design with about 12 special cases. This way I could also avoid edge artefacts and more carefully place the joins to avoid detailed geometry. However, this is less transferable to other designs and less elegant in my opinion.With some improvements, I could have the best of both worlds:Give it the ability to vary the part division location to avoid complex geometry for the best part finish. This would involve evaluating potential cross-sections of the model for complexity; a simple heuristic of the number of faces in a given cross section would be a good start.Do the same to try to avoid big gaps (for the brace, for instance)Skip teeth where joins intersect as mentioned aboveSkip teeth near voids/edgesTo do this, and possibly to replace the use of numpy-stl and/or OpenSCAD, I could look into trimesh which can do a lot more.I’m confident the assembled parts will allow for a flawless finish if filled and sanded, given my experience with the last project.I have made the code available linked to this post for the time being – I will happily package this up properly if there’s significant interest. I’m curious as to what other people could do with the idea or variant thereof.…because I’m a coder at heart derived from an imperfect scanned reference. Impressive. The video doesn’t do justice to the monumental amount of work this represents. OK so technically it’s not arbitrary, but it’s a good word! I had to get that XKCD reference in there somewhere. Of course you could go the other way and print something giant on my 256x256 X1C bed, but then I’d be doing the title justice! I had assumed I’d want to mill the next speaker, but my last project was such as success I will happily take the advantages! Please email me with any corrections or feedback.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Communication Patterns • Jacqui Read &amp; Gregor Hohpe • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTFe7Zj-hzQ</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LTFe7Zj-hzQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 13:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.On January 7, PowerSchool revealed that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal. Information stolen included individuals’ names, contact information, dates of birth, medical alert information, Social Security Numbers, and unspecified “other related information.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hacking Subaru: Tracking and controlling cars via the admin panel</title><link>https://samcurry.net/hacking-subaru</link><author>ramimac</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:22:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On November 20, 2024, Shubham Shah and I discovered a security vulnerability in Subaru’s STARLINK connected vehicle service that gave us unrestricted targeted access to all vehicles and customer accounts in the United States, Canada, and Japan.Using the access provided by the vulnerability, an attacker who only knew the victim’s last name and ZIP code, email address, phone number, or license plate could have done the following:Remotely start, stop, lock, unlock, and retrieve the current location of any vehicle.Retrieve any vehicle’s complete location history from the past year, accurate to within 5 meters and updated each time the engine starts.Query and retrieve the personally identifiable information (PII) of any customer, including emergency contacts, authorized users, physical address, billing information (e.g., last 4 digits of credit card, excluding full card number), and vehicle PIN.Access miscellaneous user data including support call history, previous owners, odometer reading, sales history, and more.After reporting the vulnerability, the affected system was patched within 24 hours and never exploited maliciously.Taking over a Subaru using only the license plate in about 10 seconds, retrieving over a years worth of location history from the vehicleMap displaying 1,600 leaked coordinates from a 2023 Subaru Impreza, similar data was retrievable for any internet-connected SubaruA little over a year ago, I bought my mom a 2023 Subaru Impreza with the promise that she would let me borrow it to try and hack it. I’d spent the last few years hunting for vulnerabilities in other automakers, but didn’t yet have the chance to look at Subaru.While visiting home for thanksgiving this year, I took my opportunity and asked for the account login to see if I could get anywhere.Auditing the MySubaru Mobile AppThe first thing I wanted to test was the MySubaru app. This app allowed users to send vehicle commands, so I proxied the app using Burp Suite and intercepted the telematic command HTTP requests, hoping to find a vulnerability to unlock cars without authorization.The below request was sent when unlocking a car via the app:

{
  ,
  ,
  ,
  
}
After failing to bypass the authorization for in-app vehicle commands, I looked around the app a bit more but couldn’t find anything interesting to test. Everything seemed properly secured. There weren’t a lot of endpoints. The authorization worked really well.Maybe testing the MySubaru app was the wrong approach.From my past experience with car companies, I knew there could be publicly accessible employee-facing applications with broader permissions than the customer-facing apps. With that in mind, I decided to shift focus and started hunting for other Subaru-related websites to test.Finding the Subaru Admin PanelI sent my friend Shubs a message over Discord to see if he’d be interested in helping me find any potential Subaru employee applications. He said sure -- and then immediately sent me this message:He noticed that ‘my.subaru.com’ (a domain that the MySubaru app was using) was a CNAME for ‘mys.prod.subarucs.com’ (a domain that I hadn’t seen before).We ran a scan to find other subdomains and checked the output:Well, that definitely looked like employee functionality. From a quick Google, it appeared that STARLINK was the name of Subaru’s in-vehicle infotainment system which provided all of the remote functionality for the vehicle. This appeared to be an admin panel related to it.Arbitrary Account Takeover on Subaru STARLINK Admin PortalAt first glance, it didn’t seem like there would be much here. It was just a login panel, and we didn’t have any credentials. I checked the source of the website hoping to see a bit more, and the following bit caught my eye:There were some interesting JavaScript files under the “/assets/_js/” folder that were loaded into the login page, so I went ahead and brute forced the directory in hopes of finding other JavaScript files.After a few minutes of running FFuF, we got a hit for a “login.js” file which the following very interesting code snippet:$().(, () {
	e.();
	($().()) {
		();
		$.({
            : ,
			: ,
            : ,
            : .({
                : email,
                : $().(),
                : $().()
            }),
			: 
		}).( () {
It appeared that there was a “resetPassword.json” endpoint that would reset employee’s accounts without a confirmation token!If this worked how it was written in the JavaScript, then an attacker could simply enter any valid employee email and take over their account. I sent the following POST request to confirm that the functionality was even accessible:

{
  ,
  ,
  
}
It seemed to be working, we just needed to find an employee’s email address to test it on. Since this was a fairly large application, there were probably a bunch of different users, we just needed to find some way to enumerate them. I dug through the rest of the JS looking for an endpoint that might let us enumerate emails until I saw the following:

{
  
}
The above endpoint would return the user’s security questions if their email was valid. We could use this to enumerate user accounts until we found someone that was active on this platform.Enumerating Employee EmailsUsing LinkedIn, we did a quick search for “Subaru STARLINK” and found a few employees who appeared to be software engineers. After getting their names, we Googled and found that Subaru emails are in the following format:[][]We tossed the few emails that we’d pieced together into the “getSecurityQuestion.json” endpoint and hit send. On the fourth attempt, we got a response back!What city were you born in?The  (redacted) email was valid! We went back to the reset password endpoint and hit send.

{
  ,
  ,
  
}
It worked! We tried logging in.We had successfully taken over an employee’s account, but there was now a 2FA prompt to actually use the website. It was custom, so we tried to see if there was anything to do to bypass it.We tried the simplest thing that we could think of: removing the client-side overlay from the UI.$().();
After removing the client-side overlay, we clicked around and the whole app seemed to function normally. All of the buttons worked, and were returning server-side data.Tracking My Mom for the Last YearThe left navbar had a ton of different functionality, but the juiciest sounding one was “Last Known Location”. I went ahead and typed in my mom’s last name and ZIP code. Her car popped up in the search results. I clicked it and saw everywhere my mom had traveled the last year:The “Last Known Location” endpoint was more than the last location, it gave me the exact coordinates of everywhere that she had started her engine or used a telematics command over the . I didn’t realize this data was being collected, but it seemed that we had agreed to the STARLINK enrollment when we purchased it.To better understand the data, I exported a year’s worth of location history from my mom’s 2023 Impreza and imported it into the Google Maps iframe below. The below map is a slightly modified export (some sensitive bits removed) of all of the locations she had visited.Visualizing a Year of Subaru Location HistoryMap displaying 1,600 leaked coordinates from a 2023 Subaru Impreza, similar data was retrievable for any internet-connected SubaruThere were a ton of other endpoints. One of them was a vehicle search which let you query a customer’s last name and zip code, phone number, email address, or VIN number (retrievable via license plate) and grant/modify access to their vehicle.After searching and finding my own vehicle in the dashboard, I confirmed that the STARLINK admin dashboard should have access to pretty much any Subaru in the United States, Canada, and Japan. We wanted to confirm that there was nothing we were missing, so we reached out to a friend and asked if we could hack her car to demonstrate that there was no pre-requisite or feature which would’ve actually prevented a full vehicle takeover.She sent us her license plate, we pulled up her vehicle in the admin panel, then finally we added ourselves to her car.We waited a few minutes, then we saw that our account had been created successfully.Now that we had access, I asked if they could peek outside and see if anything was happening with their car. I sent the “unlock” command. They then sent us this video.Afterwards, she confirmed that she did not receive any notification, text message, or email after we added ourselves as an authorized user and unlocked her car.11/20/24 11:54 PM CST: Initial report sent to SecOps email11/21/24 7:40 AM CST: Initial response from Subaru team11/21/24 4:00 PM CST: Vulnerability fixed, unable to reproduce01/23/25 6:00 AM CST: Blog post releasedWhen writing this, I had a really hard time trying to do another blog post on car hacking. Most readers of this blog already work in security, so I really don’t think the actual password reset or 2FA bypass techniques are new to anyone. The part that I felt was worth sharing was the impact of the bug itself, and how the connected car systems actually work.The auto industry is unique in that an 18-year-old employee from Texas can query the billing information of a vehicle in California, and it won’t really set off any alarm bells. It’s part of their normal day-to-day job. The employees all have access to a ton of personal information, and the whole thing relies on trust.It seems really hard to really secure these systems when such broad access is built into the system by default.Happy (late) holidays, thanks for reading!

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).→ A collection (or list) of books → A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. → Fetch all books → Create a new book → Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built an active community of trans people online</title><link>https://t4t.social/</link><author>t4t</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:07:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Drank too much water, tummy hurts, not tired at all, going to feel like death in the morning, send hole picsA vape that every time I take a hit my snout gets longer, my teeth get sharper, my ears perk higher and my tail grows down to my knees and wags like a fan bladeit’s a shame cause it has such potential, but it’s genuinely just a cesspit now.

And the longer you work on a project, the more of these builds you run into because you're just using classes you've already used before, like , , or .The platform has evolved a lot since we released Tailwind CSS v3.0, and v4.0 takes full advantage of many of these improvements.We're leveraging modern CSS features like: — giving us more control than ever over how different style rules interact with each other.Registered custom properties — making it possible to do things like animate gradients, and significantly improving performance on large pages. — which lets us adjust the opacity of any color value, including CSS variables and . — simplifying RTL support and reducing the size of your generated CSS.Many of these features have even simplified Tailwind internally, reducing the surface area for bugs and making the framework easier for us to maintain.We've streamlined the setup process a ton in v4.0, reducing the number of steps and removing a lot of boilerplate.2. Add the PostCSS plugin3. Import Tailwind in your CSSWith the improvements we've made to this process for v4.0, Tailwind feels more light-weight than ever: — no more  directives, just add  and start building. — you can start using the framework without configuring anything, not even the paths to your template files.No external plugins required — we bundle  rules for you out of the box, and use Lightning CSS under the hood for vendor prefixing and modern syntax transforms.Sure you only go through this once per project, but it adds up when you're starting and abandoning a different side-project every weekend.If you're a Vite user, you can now integrate Tailwind using  instead of PostCSS:Tailwind CSS v4.0 is incredibly fast when used as a PostCSS plugin, but you'll get even better performance using the Vite plugin.Automatic content detectionYou know how you always had to configure that annoying  array in Tailwind CSS v3? In v4.0, we came up with a bunch of heuristics for detecting all of that stuff automatically so you don’t have to configure it at all.For example, we automatically ignore anything in your  file to avoid scanning dependencies or generated files that aren’t under version control:We also automatically ignore all binary extensions like images, videos, .zip files, and more.And if you ever need to explicitly add a source that's excluded by default, you can always add it with the  directive, right in your CSS file:The  directive uses the same heuristics under the hood, so it will exclude binary file types for example as well, without you having to specify all of the extensions to scan explicitly.Before v4.0, if you wanted to inline other CSS files using  you'd have to configure another plugin like  to handle it for you.Now we handle this out of the box, so you don't need any other tools:Our import system is purpose-built for Tailwind CSS, so we've also been able to make it even faster by tightly integrating it with our engine.One of the biggest changes in Tailwind CSS v4.0 is the shift from configuring your project in JavaScript to configuring it in CSS.Instead of a  file, you can configure all of your customizations directly in the CSS file where you import Tailwind, giving you one less file to worry about in your project:The new CSS-first configuration lets you do just about everything you could do in your  file, including configuring your design tokens, defining custom utilities and variants, and more.To learn more about how it all works, read the new theme variables documentation.Tailwind CSS v4.0 takes all of your design tokens and makes them available as CSS variables by default, so you can reference any value you need at run-time using just CSS.Using the example  from earlier, all of these values will be added to your CSS to as regular custom properties:This makes it easy to reuse these values as inline styles or pass them to libraries like Motion to animate them.We've simplified the way many utilities and variants work in v4.0 by effectively allowing them to accept certain types of arbitrary values,  the need for any configuration or dropping down to the arbitrary value syntax.For example, in Tailwind CSS v4.0 you can create grids of any size out of the box:You can also target custom boolean data attributes without needing to define them:Even spacing utilities like , , , , and more are now dynamically derived from a single spacing scale variable and accept any value out of the box:The upgrade tool we released alongside v4.0 will even simplify most of these utilities for you automatically if it notices you using an arbitrary value that's no longer needed.We've upgraded the entire default color palette from  to , taking advantage of the wider gamut to make the colors more vivid in places where we were previously limited by the sRGB color space.We've tried to keep the balance between all the colors the same as it was in v3, so even though we've refreshed things across the board, it shouldn't feel like a breaking change when upgrading your existing projects.We've brought container query support into core for v4.0, so you don't need the @tailwindcss/container-queries plugin anymore:We've also added support for max-width container queries using the new  variant:Like our regular breakpoint variants, you can also stack  and  variants to define container query ranges:We've finally added APIs for doing 3D transforms, like , , , , and tons more.We've added a ton of new gradient features in v4.0, so you can pull off even fancier effects without having to write any custom CSS.Linear gradients now support angles as values, so you can use utilities like  to create a gradient on a 45 degree angle:You may notice we've renamed  to  too — you'll see why shortly!We've added the ability to control the color interpolation mode for gradients using a modifier, so a class like  interpolates using sRGB, and  interpolates using OKLCH:Using polar color spaces like OKLCH or HSL can lead to much more vivid gradients when the  and  colors are far apart on the color wheel. We're using OKLAB by default in v4.0 but you can always interpolate using a different color space by adding one of these modifiers.We've added new  and  utilities for creating conic and radial gradients:These new utilities work alongside the existing , , and  utilities to let you create conic and radial gradients the same way you create linear gradients, and include modifiers for setting the color interpolation method and arbitrary value support for controlling details like the gradient position.The new  variant adds support for the new CSS  feature, making it possible to transition element properties when an element is first displayed:With , you can finally animate elements as they appear on the page without the need for any JavaScript at all. Browser support probably isn't quite there yet for most teams, but we're getting close!We've added a new  variant which finally adds support for the CSS  pseudo-class:It does double duty and also lets you negate media queries and  queries:We've added a ton of other new utilities and variants to v4.0 too, including: — for auto-resizing textareas without writing a single line of JavaScript. — so you can finally get rid of those ugly light scrollbars in dark mode. — for carefully tweaking variable fonts that support different widths. — for styling non-interactive elements marked with the  attribute. — for doing really clever things you'll eventually regret. — which is a lot like , but without the need for the  class. — using the existing  variant to also target open popovers.Check out the relevant documentation for all of these features to learn more.And that's it — that's Tailwind CSS v4.0. It's been years of work to get to this point, but we're all extremely proud of this release and we can't wait to see what you build with it.Check it out, play with it, maybe even break it, and definitely let us know what you think.Just no bug reports until tomorrow please — let us at least enjoy one celebratory team dinner and maybe relax in the hot tub at this hotel for a bit believing that somehow we really did ship flawless software.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Using generative AI as part of historical research: three case studies</title><link>https://resobscura.substack.com/p/the-leading-ai-models-are-now-very</link><author>benbreen</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 23:29:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Steve Pagliuca Brought Bain’s Playbook to the Celtics | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyoWePXT50g</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NyoWePXT50g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 23:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with Steve Pagliuca to discuss his ownership principles for the Boston Celtics and Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio.

custom controllers. After all, what’s not to like about being able to provision
resources with declarative configuration: Control loops are fun,
and Kubebuilder makes it extremely easy to get started with writing Kubernetes
controllers. Next thing you know, customers in production are relying on the
buggy controller you developed without understanding how to design idiomatic
APIs and building reliable controllers.Low barrier to entry combined with good intentions and the “illusion of
 implementation” is not a recipe for
success while developing production-grade controllers. I’ve seen the real-world
consequences of controllers developed without adequate understanding of
Kubernetes and the controller machinery at multiple large companies. We went
back to the drawing board and rewritten nascent controller implementations a few
times to observe which mistakes people new to controller development
make.Design CRDs like Kubernetes APIsIt takes less than 5 minutes to write a Go struct and generate a Kubernetes
CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) from it thanks to controller-gen. Then it takes
several months to migrate from this poorly designed API to a better v2 design
while the old API is being used in productionDon’t do yourself that.If you’re serious about developing long-lasting production grade controllers,
you have to deeply understand the API Conventions that
Kubernetes uses to design its builtin APIs. Then, you need to study the builtin
APIs, and think about things like “why is this field here”, “why is this field
not a boolean”, “why is this a list of objects and not a string array”. Only
when you’re able to reason about the builtin Kubernetes APIs and their design
principles, you’ll be able to design a long-lasting custom resource API.They don’t understand the difference between  and  and who
should be updating each field (more about this later ).They don’t understand how to embed a child object within a parent object
(e.g. how  becomes a ) so they end up
re-creating child object properties in the parent object, usually with a
worse organized structure.They don’t understand field semantics well (e.g. zero values, defaulting,
validation) and end up with fields that are not set, or set to wrong values
accepted into the API.
I covered this topic in my
CRD generation pitfalls article. If the behavior of the
API is not clear when a field is not set, you’ve already failed.
API conventions guide covers this topic fairly well.If you study the builtin Kubernetes APIs extensively, you’ll find out things like
 field is not a “must have”, and not all APIs offer a  field.
I would go as far as to say that you should also study custom APIs of projects
like Knative, Istio and other popular controllers to develop a better
understanding of organizing fields, and how to reuse some core types Kubernetes
already offers (like , ).Single-responsibility controllersTime and time again we find engineers adding new unrelated responsibilities to
existing controllers because it seems like a good place their  can be
shoved into. Kubernetes core controllers don’t have this problem for a reason.One of the main Kubernetes design principles is that controllers have clear
inputs and outputs —and they do a well-defined job. For example, the Job
controller watches  objects and creates s, which is a clear mental
model to reason about. Similarly, each API is designed to offer a well defined
functionality. A controller’s output can be an input to another controller.
This is all what the UNIX
philosophy suggests for
a well reasoned system.I recommend studying the common controller shapes (great talk by Daniel Smith,
one of the architects of kube-apiserver) and the core Kubernetes controllers.
You’ll notice that each core controller in Kubernetes core has a very clear job
and inputs/outputs that can be explained in a small diagram. If your controller
isn’t like this, you’re probably misarchitecting either your controller, or your
CRDs.If you architect your APIs and controllers correctly, your controllers will run
in harmony as if they’re integrating with Kubernetes core APIs or an
off-the-shelf operator.When you controller design doesn’t quite feel right, or has too many
inputs/outputs, does too much, or in general doesn’t , you’re
probably doing it unidiomatically. I struggled with this a lot myself,
especially while developing controllers that manage external resources that have
a non-declarative configuration paradigm.Assuming you use kubebuilder (which uses controller-runtime like
almost everyone else to develop a controller, and you implement the
 method that controller-runtime invokes every time one of your
inputs change. This is where your controller does its magic, and since it’s
possible to implement this method in any way, most beginners dump their
spaghetti here.Therefore, large projects like Knative define their own common controller
shapes
where every controller runs the same set steps in the same order.  By developing
a common controller shape/framework, you create a “guardrail” so that other
engineers don’t deviate and introduce bugs in the reconciliation flow easily.Sadly, controller-runtime is not opinionated about this topic. Your best bet is
to read other controllers (like Cluster
API to learn the idioms and
master the reconciliation flow.There are also new projects like Apollo SDK by
Reddit that claims to offer
finite-state machines for controller-runtime reconcilers.Over time, we found that almost all our controllers have a similar
reconciliation flow. Here’s a pseudo-code of how our controllers look like:Most notably, you’ll see here that we always initialize conditions and always
update status inside  even if the reconciliation fails.I recommend enforcing a similar common shape for controllers developed at your
company (you can use custom kubebuilder plugins during scaffolding, but you
can’t really  that either).Report  and I practically never seen a beginner engineer create a CRD that has properly
designed  fields (if one exists, at all). Kubernetes API
conventions discuss this at length, so I’ll keep it
brief. If an API object is reconciled by a controller, the resource should
expose its status in  fields. For example, there’s no ConfigMap
controller so ConfigMap doesn’t have a  field.At LinkedIn, our custom API objects have a  field, similar to
the Kubernetes core or Knative
conditions,
and we use something similar to Knative condition set manager that provides
high-level accessor methods to set the conditions, and sort them etc.This helps us define and report conditions for API objects in a high-level way
in the reconciler code:Every time we mark a condition, the condition manager recalculates the top-level
 condition, which all our objects have as Kubernetes API conventions
suggest. Other controllers and humans consume this top-level condition to
understand how the objects are doing (plus you get to use 
on your objects).Learn to use Something notable is that all our  have an 
field. You’ll even see some popular community CRDs (like ArgoCD
Application)
do not offer this field.Essentially, this field tells us whether the condition is calculated based on
the last configuration of the object —or whether we’re looking at
a scale status information because the controller hasn’t gotten to reconciling
the object after the update.For example, observing a  condition set to  alone means nothing
(other than at some point in the past it was true). The condition offers a
meaningful status info if and only if the cond.observedGeneration == metadata.generation. A controller we had in production didn’t have the notion
of , so its callers would update the object’s  and
immediately check its  condition. This condition would almost always be
stale, as the controller hadn’t reconciled the object yet. So the callers
interpreted an app rollout as , even though it hadn’t even started
yet (and sometimes actually failed, but that failure was never noticed).Understand the cached clientscontroller-runtime, by default, gives you a client to the Kubernetes API which
serves the reads from an in-memory cache (as it uses shared informers from
 under the covers). This is mostly fine, as controllers are designed
to operate on stale data —but it is detrimental if you didn’t know this
was the case since you might be writing buggy controllers due to this (more on
this later in “expectations” section).When you perform a write (which directly hits the API server), its results may
not be immediately visible in the cached client. For example, when you delete an
object, it may still show up in the list result in a subsequent reconciliation
to your surprise.The lesser-known behavior of controller-runtime most beginners don’t realize is
that controller-runtime establishes new informers on-the-fly. Normally, when you
specify explicit event sources while building your controller (e.g. in
builder.{For,Owns,Watches}), the informers are started and caches are started
during startup.However, if you try to make queries with  on resources that
you haven’t declared upfront in your controller setup, controller-runtime will
initialize an informer on-the-fly and block on warming up its cache. This leads
to issues like:Controller-runtime starting a watch for a resource type and start caching all
its objects in memory (even if you were trying to query only one resource),
potentially leading to the process running out of memory.Unpredictable reconciliation times while the informer cache is syncing, during
which your worker goroutine will be blocked from reconciling other resources.That’s why I recommend setting ReaderFailOnMissingInformer: true and disabling
this behavior so you’re fully aware of what kinds your controller is maintaining
watches/caches on. Otherwise, controller-runtime doesn’t provide any
observability on what informers it’s maintaining in the process.controller-runtime offers a lot of other cache knobs, such as entirely
disabling the cache on certain types, dropping some fields from the in-memory
cache, or limit the cache to certain namespaces. I recommend studying them to
better understand how you can customize the cache behavior.Fast and offline reconciliationReconciling an object that is alredy up-to-date (i.e. goal state == current
state) should be really fast and offline —meaning it should not make any
API calls (to external APIs or writes to Kubernetes API). That’s why controllers
use cached clients to serve reads from the
cache to determine the state of the world.I’ve seen many real-world controllers making API calls to external systems, or
make status updates to Kubernetes API (even when nothing has changed) every time
 got invoked. This is an anti-pattern, and a really bad idea for
writing scalable and reliable controllers:They bombarded the external APIs with unnecessary calls during controller
startup (or full resyncs, or when they had bugs causing infinite requeue
loops)When the external API was down, reconciliation would fail even though
nothing has changed in the object. Depending on the implementation, this
can block the next steps in the reconciliation flow even though those steps
don’t depend on this external API call.Logic that takes long to execute in a reconciliation loop will hog the worker
goroutine, and cause workqueue depth to increase, and reduce the
throughput/responsiveness of the controller as the worker goroutine is
occupied with the slow task.Let’s go through a concrete example: Assume you have an S3Bucket controller that
creates and manages S3 buckets using AWS S3 API. If you make a query to S3 API
on every reconciliation, you’re doing it wrong. Instead, you should store the
result of the S3 API calls you made, in a field like
status.observedGeneration, to reflect what’s the last generation of the object
that was successfully conveyed to S3 API. If this field has 0 value, the
controller knows it needs to make a “Create Bucket” call to S3 API. When a
client updates the S3Bucket custom resource, its  will no
longer match its stored status.observedGeneration, so the controller knows it
needs to make a “Update Bucket” call to S3 API, and only upon success it will
update the status.observedGeneration field. This way, you avoid making calls
to the external S3 API when the object is already up-to-date.Your  function signature returns

+ values. Usually beginners don’t have a solid grasp on what values to
return from .You should know that your  function is invoked every time your
event sources declared in builder.{For,Owns,Watches} changes. If you know
that, my general advice while returning reconciliation values:If you have s during reconciliation, return the error; not . Controller-runtime will requeue for you.Use  only when there’s no error but something you started is
still in progress, and you want to check its status with the default backoff
logic.Use  only when you want to reconcile the object after
a certain time has passed. This is useful for implementing a wall-clock based
periodic reconciliation (e.g. a CronJob controller, or you want to retry
reconciliation at a custom poll interval).It’s a matter of
preference
whether your  function should make as much progress as possible in
a single run; or, return early every time you change something and requeue
itself again. You’ll see the earlier approach is more unit-test friendly and
what you’ll find more frequently in the open-source controllers because if your
event triggers are set up correctly, the object will get requeued anyway.Workqueue/resync mechanicsOpenKruise has an article about workqueue mechanics, go read
that. I frequently see beginners not relying on assumptions like an object
is guaranteed to be reconciled at the same time in different workers, so they
end up implementing unnecessary locking mechanisms in their controllers.Similarly, beginners frequently don’t understand  and  an
object gets reconciled. For example, when your controller updates the object
it’s working on, it’ll be requeued for a reconciliation immediately again
(because the update you made triggers watch event).Even when no objects were updated, all watched resources will be requeued
periodically  to get reconciled again (called “resync” configured via
 option). This is the default behavior since the controllers may
miss watch events (very rare), or skip processing some events during leadership
change. But this behavior causes you to do a full reconciliation of all objects
cached. So by default, your controller should assume it’ll reconcile the
entire world periodically. We had a controller that managed several thousand objects
and it did a full resync every 20 minutes. Every object took several seconds to
reconcile. So any time a client created or updated an object, it would not get
reconciled until many minutes later, as it goes to the back of the workqueue
among. If this happened during full resync or controller startup, it took
many minutes until any work was done on this object.Starting with controller-runtime v0.20 has
introduced
a priority
queue
implementation for the workqueue. This would deprioritize reconciliation of
objects that were not edge-triggered (i.e. due to an create/update etc.) and
make the controller more responsive during full resyncs and controller startups.That’s why understanding the workqueue semantics, worker count
() and monitoring your controller’s reconciliation
latency, workqueue depth and active workers count is super important to know if
your controller scales or not.We discussed above that controller-runtime client serves the  from an
informer cache, and doesn’t query the API server except during the
startup/resyncs.This cache is kept up-to-date based on the received “watch” events from the API
server. Therefore, your controller will almost certainly read stale data at some
point, since the watch events arrive asynchronously after the writes you make.
Cached clients don’t offer read-your-writes
consistency.This means you need to program your  method with this assumption at
all times. This is not at all intuitive, but a reality when you work with
a cached client. I’ll give several real-world examples: You’re implementing the  controller. Controller sees
*a
ReplicaSet with  , so it lists the pods with  (which
is served from the cache), and you get 3 Pods. It turns out the informer cache
wasn’t up-to-date, but the API actually had 5 pods.  Your controller creates 2
more pods, now you have 7 Pods.  Definitely not what you wanted. Now you’re scaling down a ReplicaSet from 5 to 3. You list the
Pods, you see 5 Pods, you delete 2 Pods, and next time you list the Pods again,
you still see, you delete another 2 Pods. If your deletion logic is not
deterministic (e.g. sorting Pods by name), you scaled from 5 to 1
—definitely not what you wanted. For every object kind=, you create an object kind=. When
 gets updated, you update . The update succeeds, but next time you reconcile
 again, you don’t see an updated version of , so you update  to the
goal state again, and you get a  error because you’re updating the old
version of the object. But you already updated it, why update again?If you don’t know how to solve these problems in your controller, it’s likely
because you haven’t seen the “expectations” pattern before.In this case, controllers need to do in memory bookkeeping of their expectations
that resulted from the successful writes they made.
Once an expectation is recorded, the controller knows it needs to wait for the
cache to catch up (which will trigger another reconciliation), and not do its
job based on the stale result it sees from the cache.You can see many core controllers use this
pattern,
and Elastic operator also has a great
explanation
alongside their implementation. We implemented a couple of variants of these
at LinkedIn ourselves.Usually when you have controller development questions, join the Kubernetes
slack and ask in the #controller-runtime channel. The maintainers are very
helpful!  If you’re looking for a good controller implementation, I recommend
studying the Cluster API
codebase.  Also, Operator SDK has a best practices
guide you
should check out.I’m not the most experienced person to write a detailed guide on this, but I’ll
be writing more about beginner pitfalls and controller development anti-patterns.At LinkedIn we use a controller development exercise a former
colleague came up with to onboard new engineers to
get them to understand the controller machinery. This exercise touches many
aspects of controller development and gets people familiar with core Kubernetes
APIs:
Implement a SequentialJob API and controller. The API should
allow users to specify a series of run-to-completion (batch job) container
images to run sequentially.How do users specify the list of containers? (Do you use the core types?)Do you report status? How is status calculated? How do you surface job failures?Where do you validate user inputs? Where do you report reconciliation failures?What happens if the SequentialJob changes while the jobs are running?How are the child resources you created are cleaned up?I hope this article helps you be a better controller developer. If you feel like
this sort of work resonates with you, we’re usually hiring nowadays [1]

– Nikola TeslaIt’s got a 4K AMOLED display, a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard, plays Minecraft at 4K, runs +7B LLMs, surfs the web, and has ~7h battery life. All open-source.How I Made A Laptop From Scratch (YouTube.com). Demo at 22:14.The writeup below pretty much abridges the video above.Imagine a skill-chart of qualities of technology: screen, audio, performance, build, tactility, touch-interaction, efficiency, size, and so many more. At the balancing point of all these qualities is the laptop. To that end, let’s build a laptop that hits as many qualities of a modern commercial thin & light laptop—while trying to do as much from scratch as possible.Booting and inserting magnetically attached keyboardEpic Hypixel Bedwars gamingFinding an electron in a cloudI first made a mental map and transferred it into Obsidian:Boiling it down, it landed me with a lofty list of goals:RK3588 SoC Motherboard
Powertrain
~60Wh Li-ion battery packPeripherals
Wireless mechanical keyboardGlass-topped multi-touch trackpadAnodized aluminum CNC chassisI looked towards single-board computer SoCs, as board manufacturers commonly release schematics for reference. In many aspects, the Rockchip RK3588 is the fastest consumer-procurable chip on the market. Despite the spotty software support, the hardware documentation has lots of developer resources and reference schematics from SBC manufacturers.Quad core A76 and quad core A55I/O: 8K display, dual USB3.1, PCIe 3.0 x 4, HDMI2.1/eDP 1.4, etc.With only a few months to work on this project, an SoM (system on module) like the Raspberry Pi CM5 presented the best option for its hardware compatibility and a high likelihood of a snug integration. Choosing an SoM also alleviates memory and other high-speed signaling concerns. Looking around for a RK3588 SoM, I came across the CM3588 by FriendlyElec. Cheap, well-documented, and easily procurable. Sounds good!I hopped on panelook.com and filtered by size and resolution. I’ve always been a sucker for high pixel density, so I went with a 4K AMOLED 13.3” display. Cross referencing stock availability on Taobao (Chinese domestic Aliexpress), the ATNA33TP11 seemed to be the one with most  stock since OLED risked burn-in.A highlight: during display evaluation, switching out a connector and shortening the board by 2mm improved signal integrity  for the 1.5GHz x 4 signals go pass through. Getting the display running on Linux meant finding system logs from Asus laptops that have this display, reverse-engineering the values, and tuning the power-on timings amongst other things . TLDR; getting a 4K AMOLED eDP display running on non-mainline Linux was a heck of a journey, so read this if you’re interested (coming soon).ATNA33TP11 working with display evaluation board V2 shortThe cells had to be 6mm thin and four packs lined up should take roughly half of the entire chassis volume. Chinese manufacturers don’t stock batteries readily, and shipping them to the US would be a pain. Thus, I looked on the American side. I stumbled upon with these batteries from AA Portable Power Corp. or batteryspace.com. or Powerizer. Doing the power calculations, we get: 4.250Ah  4S = 62.9 Wh with max 8A (so max 134.4W discharge)! Solid.The total voltage is 4.2V (peak) * 4S = 16.8V. The system’s designed for up to 20V USB-C (AKA 100W) and passed into the BQ25713 charging IC. The batteries are balanced with the BQ77915 to ensure safe charging, and the power is tracked with an LTC2943 to calculate a state-of-charge percentage. I popped in an ESP32-S3 module as the controller for everything, and set it to production.After writing drivers and sitting on the undecipherable datasheets for days, I had the batteries charging. I successfully load tested it to around 5A and powered the full system. There’s still a lot of quiescent current (about ~50mA), but I haven’t had the time to optimize the firmware.The USB of the ESP32 connects to the internal USB on the motherboard to feed the power telemetry over UART. A Python script and kernel module in the OS forwards it to the battery service in the kernel to display it natively.Powertrain V0.2 inside laptopIn settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scrollWith those decisions made up, I aimed for >90mm motherboard width based on a prelim CAD from the batteries and display dimensions.On the physical I/O side, I settled on dual USB3.1 Type-C ports, a USB2.0 Type-A port, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Internally, the M.2 E-key connects to an RTL8852BE WiFi 6 (802.11ax) + BT5.2 wireless card and the M.2 M-key accommodates up to an 2242-sized NVMe SSD. A full size NVMe SSD can fit with some modifications of the chassis too.Tangent over, this leaves me with around ~90mm of board height. Implementing all the features on the final mainboard would stretch this writeup too long, so read this if you’re interested (coming soon).In settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scrollDetailed hardware overviewJoshua Riek’s ubuntu-rockchip kernel/distro combined an out-of-the-box experience with lots of optimizations. Using Armbian’s kernel (I believe it’s still off Rockchip’s kernel) meant that it offered nearly all the features of the RK3588 on a developer-ready kernel configuration.Since nearly all the work I needed to do was abstracted in the DeviceTree (DTS) hardware configuration language implemented with U-boot, the bootloader, I took advantage of their system-agnostic nature to speed up my trial-and-error process having never done any Linux work.Instead of developing and compiling code on the RK3588 itself, I used my daily driver MacBook and Visual Studio Code. Once I made a change in the DTS, I’d use Orbstack (virtualization software) running Ubuntu 24.04 (shared filesystem and kernel with macOS) and compile the DeviceTree there.Pointing U-Boot to a custom compiled DTB (devicetree binary), I ’ed the compiled  to the OS. A  regenerates the bootloader configurations, and a reboot updates the changes.That’s how I did the hardware bringup—display configurations, PCIe, USB, and other low-level system tweaks. The rest is just a standard install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Linux Kernel 6.1.Testing batteries and writing DTSIn-depth software overviewImagine being able to just pull out your laptop’s keyboard and use it as just another wireless keyboard for literally anything! Just me? Maybe.Being a mechanical keyboard addict with quite a few ZMK keyboards designed, I chose the Cherry MX ULP mechanical switches for the best feel. Of course, a battery and fully mechanical switches add  of height. I used a 1mm thin 200mAh battery and a custom battery protection board that sticks up between two rows of keys to cut down on ~1.6mm (PCB height). The nRF52840 SoC running ZMK Firmware is right underneath the spacebar. A sandwich of PLA and 6061 aluminum from Fabworks crammed everything under ~7mm.Since the keycaps aren’t easily procurable, I got a 0.15mm nozzle for my Bambu Lab X1C and printed them with PLA. It got me down a rabbit hole of tungsten nozzles, and I got quoted ~$400 for 20x 0.15mm nozzles. I’ve been thinking of trying that out too. But alas, printing out all the keycaps and assembling for the last time, the keyboard was done.Moving on to the trackpad, it was quite quick. I knew from the start that I wanted a good trackpad, so making my own with zero capacitive tracking experience is a no-go. Searching online, I came across the Azoteq PXM0057-401 evaluation module on Mouser. It had it all—glass surface, multi-touch, and worked over USB. And, it was only 35 bucks or so. However, the trackpad has ceased production without many alternatives.With the keyboard and trackpad working, it was time to put on the finishing touches.In settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scroll*Counterclockwise from top left: keyboard side profile, typing on keyboard, trackpad, 1mm battery on back, nRF52840 SoC areaOnShape wireframe exploded viewRoughly the same time I began the system design, I sent a few CNC aluminum blocks off to JLC for evaluation with different anodization finishes. The dark gray anodization felt “best”, but I preferred the look of the matte black, so I settled on that.
Using PTC OnShape, I (attempted) CAD’ed a robust and minimalistic look and a blend of my two favorite laptop lineup designs, the Razer Blade and the MacBook Pro. Because of the removable keyboard, the bottom has no screws. Instead, the palm rest screws into the bottom chassis. CAD Link here.The hardest part about the chassis was the hinge. I used Framework’s 13.3” hinge because it has a 3D model. I constrained it in OnShape so I can see the exact closing angles.The chassis layout is fairly simple: batteries on the bottom, the power board on the right, motherboard on the left, and the hinge mechanism on top. Oh, and a transparent PETG FDM printed power button that lights up on a custom PCB. To balance out the asymmetric hinge (caused by the mainboard being too wide), a little carbon fiber rod lines up on the left side too.It was a battle to get the screen assembly to not hit anything while also covering
Although I started considering thermals way in advance, hence the gap here for the heatpipe to go through, I still had difficulty fitting everything in. The distance between the bottom of the keyboard and the top of the heatsink is less than a half a millimeter. The cooling system is really constrained because I don’t have the resources to make a custom heatpipe and fin solution. So, I made a full copper CNC heatsink (from JLCCNC) and a heatpipe connected to a fan. It’s all connected with PTM7950.I also added these PUI audio speakers on either side. The audio from the CM3588’s DAC didn’t work and I ran out of debugging time, so I made a USB to audio converter board separately and shot it through an Class-D amplifier. I would’ve also made the amp, but I ran out of time.As I reached final assembly, I used a mix of JLC’s selective laser sintering (SLS) of nylon powder and FDM printed PA6-CF for smaller structural parts. Putting it all together with the matte black CNC aluminum chassis, I finally had my laptop.Inside full laptop assemblyThe hardest class I’ve taken so far was quantum mechanics in my junior spring term. A few months before spending hours solving time-independent and dependent Schrödinger equations, I was on the squash bus (the sport, not the vegetable). My friend suggested I make a laptop for my senior project—and that was all.
I came up with the name anyon_e in June, after I finished the quantum course.Making this laptop was hard. Mentally pressured with a deadline, and a constant inter-disciplinary challenge across electrical, software, and mechanical systems. Summing up everything I’ve ever done. It took up most of my mind from May until now.Inspired by open-source projects like ZMK, KiCAD, Blender, and countless OSHW projects, I want to do my own little part. To put power in people’s hands in creation, innovation, imagination, or whatever else. To attempt the impossible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to improve your WFH lighting to reduce eye strain</title><link>https://rustle.ca/posts/articles/work-from-home-lighting</link><author>jahfer</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:08:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I work from home everyday, I am susceptible to eye strain, eye pain, and dizziness. Having a working environment that’s as easy on my eyes as possible is of critical importance. I hope that by sharing what I've learned, it can be helpful to you if you work from home, and like many, have experienced WFH eye strain.Disclaimer: I'm not an ergonomist or optometrist. These tips are intended to help improve your work from home comfort based on my own personal experience.An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyesWhen it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too littleUse natural light wherever possible Quality of artificial light mattersThe best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomicsEven the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and take care of yourselfWhat is it about computer screens that makes them fatiguing?Most monitors have some level of flicker. This flickering is generally not visually noticeable, but can still be fatiguing. Monitors at lower brightness levels exhibit more flicker - as they use PWM dimming (Pulse Width Modulation). In some monitors this is done by changing the ON/OFF intervals, increasing OFF timing, and lowering ON timing — while maintaining the same brightness! This creates an awful strobe-effect, and can be very exhausting — especially when working in an environment where the monitor is the sole light source.High contrast lighting can exist in a few different formats. It can exist as  — that is for example light coming in from a window, into a dark room, illuminating a part of your desk. This glare is fatiguing on your eyes because they are accommodating for two levels of brightness simultaneously, while also trying to conduct tasks on a computer monitor — such as reading. High contrast can also exist in a room with bright light on the left, and darkness on the right. This is fatiguing for your eyes to compensate for.When working at a computer, most of the time and the don't move significantly. We focus at the same distances for long periods of time. This causes our eye muscles to get tight and overworked. This can cause our eyes to get tired, spasm, or sometimes even make it very hard to relax our eyes. Although improved office lighting can help with this, the main way to solve for this problem is to take breaks practicing the 20/20/20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look up from your screen and focus on something approximately 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.Light in the office primarily comes in from the sun. The direct light causes glare, and because of the lack of diffusion, makes for dark corners in the room. Even with a light overhead, it's not enough to equal the amount from outside. This results in high contrast, dark spots behind the monitor, and harsh shadows. Blackout curtains are of little help because they only serve to reduce the size of the light coming in, as opposed to aiding with diffusion. Anytime it's dark outside, it's like working at night. Not fun.Light primarily comes from above. Because of this single light source, it makes for harsh shadows, dark spots, and high contrast. The contrast issue is particularly apparent with the monitor, which although can be dimmed, creates a bright monitor, which also self-shades the wall behind resulting in a dark background.Window light sources, and filtering lightWindows now have light-filtering curtains, which helps to not only reduce the amount of light on bright days, but also to heavily diffuse the light coming in, which makes for a beautiful glow in the room. In addition, I've installed wood-blinds (not shown) behind the curtains which helps to further control the amount of light entering the office on very bright days.Products used: Sheer curtains • Wood BlindsEach corner of the room now has a torchiere lamp, which helps to create an even lighting environment. These lamps point directly up and light the room indirectly through reflections off of the walls and ceiling. In the center of the ceiling, a fabric wrapped light fixture provides  diffused lighting. This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to match the amount of light from the standing lamps. The desk now has even lighting. The brightness of the monitor is now matched by a dimmable flicker-free backlight, which makes working at the display less fatiguing. In addition, a monitor lightbar (not shown), provides indirect light to the desk, reflected off the surface which is completely dimmable and flicker-free. These two lights together help to make for an even lighting environment during the day, and a calm and cozy environment at night. In addition to the two lights, the Apple Studio display has an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the brightness to match the ambient light, which is a game changer for light sensitive people. An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes. Try to balance out dark/light spots with additional lighting, and diffusing strong light sources — like the sun.When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little. When dealing with too little light, add additional light sources which provide indirect, and reflective lights — such as up-lights, or torchieres, or lights that have a shade. When dealing with too much light — use blinds, sheer curtains, or light filtering curtains. If you have too much light from an artificial source, use lower wattage bulbs, or consider adding a dimmer switch.Use natural light wherever possible. If you've got natural light, use it to your advantage. Natural light is healthier than artificial light — there's no flicker, and it can provide us with much needed vitamin D. For rooms with small windows, use mirrors to help reflect natural light and fill the room. Quality of Artificial Light Matters. Wherever possible seek out high quality lighting that is dimmable and flicker-free. Spending a few extra dollars for these products is worth it, and it will result in less fatigue. For regular bulbs, I recommend Philipps Ultra Definition LED Soft Whitebulbs which have low flicker rates, glass enclosures, high color rendering index, and a relatively inexpensive pricepoint.The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics. When working from home, we spend a lot of time on video calls, and it's natural to want to look our best. Studio lights that attach to our desks, or facing a window outdoor will result in great lighting on camera, but can also cause fatigue. Consider reserving this lighting for calls, or see if generally better room lighting can result in a similar light quality on camera.Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and think beyond lighting! Having a great lighting environment will help you with stamina, but having good work habits like the 20/20/20 rule, and changing up posture and working environments are important in order to take the best care of your eyes, and your body. Think beyond lighting when considering ergonomics, such as room humidity (to limit dry eye), posture, chair position, and stay moving to keep blood flowing.It may seem daunting, but I believe that with some small changes it can make a big difference. I hope this gives you new ideas to try, and I'd love to hear what you are doing in your own office as well! Cheers!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kyle&apos;s Frat Party</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c1OWon1MSo</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0c1OWon1MSo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:07:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To see our new movie 'Dear Kelly,' head over to https://www.dearkellyfilm.com/, where it is available for purchase OR $5.55/rental.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dark web PHP dev Ross Ulbricht released from prison…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-wuoIDdjw</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gi-wuoIDdjw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:04:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ross Ulbricht received a presidential pardon for his crimes related to the Silk Road.

Panpsychism is the extreme claim that everything in the physical world—all subatomic particles-are in some sense ‘conscious’ or have a basic kind of ‘proto-consciousness’. Why are an increasing number of leading philosophers taking panpsychism seriously? Something must be up. Could it be doubt that the scientific project to explain consciousness has failed?

I assume they scrape cell phone numbers from WhitePages and just spray-and-pray hoping to get a response.My parents own some undeveloped land in the middle of town which lies mostly in a flood zone and the usable acreage is much less than it appears on paper.  Of course the brokers don't know this, so the prospect of buying up a big plot which has been vacant for decades for cheap probably gets their mouths watering.Over Christmas break I worked on a system for controlling my phone's SMS application over MQTT from a remote workstation running Ollama.  Below is an overview of the system:                      ANDROID PHONE                  LLM SERVER

The first step is to forward text messages somehow to the LLM workstation.  There are several SMS forwarding tools on both F-Droid and the Play store, but most of them only supported one-way forwarding received SMS via POST request to some REST endpoint.  I saw one application which supports POSTing messages back to the phone, but since the phone is behind a CGLAN, I really wanted some kind of long-running socket connection to the workstation.I ended up finding the verbosely named Android-SMS-Gateway-MQTT, which runs in the background and waits to send/receive messages and works without changing the default messaging app.For some reason the app can be commanded to send messages via MQTT, but received messages are forwarded via POST request only.  I made some modifications to use MQTT for communication both ways.I really don't enjoy touching Android development, so I gave a shot at using Cursor.ai to make the changes and it worked perfectly first try!  The prompt I used is below:[SMSListener.java (41-46)]
How do I turn this POST request into an MQTT message?  I'd like to use the MQTT connection already present in the file `BackgroundService.java` if possible.
Disabling battery optimization is necessary for the application to run reliably in the background.  Fortunately the power consumption for the app is insignificant.  The .apk is available in the project files.The job of the Python script is simply to listen on MQTT for new SMS messages and send generated LLM responses back to the Android application.
I want the language model to be able to give responses that make sense in context, so I store each ongoing conversation in a separate JSON file and feed the last N messages to the language model when generating responses.[

A big part of the fun is being able to create different ridiculous personalities and backstories.  The Python script reads from a config where I can assign different personalities to conversations.The Ollama TUI also makes it really convenient to experiment with different prompts and update these personas.  I don't even have to restart the script![evan@copernicus ~] ollama run llama3.3

>>> /set system "you are a college bro responding via SMS.  you want to sell your property.  you only respond with single sentences and use millenial speak. your responses are very short and you don't capitalize letters.  you always want to sell.  everything you write is lowercase and your property is for sale. you should be open to negotiation and accept even low offers"

Set system message.

>>> Hey this is Bob with [redacted].  We're looking to buy vacant land near the one you own in [redacted].  Are you interested in a fair offer?

my property in [redacted] goes hard and i'm down to sell for a lowkey decent price, hit me with an offer fam

Experimentation in the Ollama shellAnd now for what you've been waiting for!  The first message in these screenshots is written by me to get the other person to respond after I've whitelisted the conversation.  These chats are all I have at the moment, but I may come back and add more as more spam rolls in.I started off the project using Phi4, but I had difficulty keeping the LLM responses short.  After switching to llama3.3, this seems to have improved a lot.I'm not sure what the legal implications are of agreeing to sell land that I don't even own, so lately I've instructed the models to never actually close on anything.People have mentioned that responding to SMS spam helps the spammers to "warm up" a number and build carrier reputation so they can send more spam texts.  I figure that reporting and blocking the numbers after I've had my fun is a reasonable compromise.I do get some spam calls in addition to texts, but I haven't noticed an increase in either quite yet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Leads the Way in 2025 IEEE Tech Impact Study</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/2025-ieee-tech-impact-study</link><author>Kathy Pretz</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTc5NDQ5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODA2MDk0Mn0.vrp8uB3JWeJKElVhIiSkYQAq-2OhkKhM4FzOaTa8HO0/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tech leaders also ranked cloud computing and robotics as most important]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2260 - Lex Fridman</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I94u4_Wb82E</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/I94u4_Wb82E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 18:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lex Fridman is a computer scientist and researcher in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics, and host of the Lex Fridman Podcast.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Documented terror - Where are Syria&apos;s missing prisoners? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptuDWhSTFl0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ptuDWhSTFl0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Burns, strangulation, broken bones. The list of signs of torture is long and can be seen on some 27,000 photos showing dead Syrian civilians. The man who smuggled the photos out of the country calls himself "Caesar”.

During the long decades of the Assad regime, hundreds of thousands of people disappeared inside its torture centers.  For years, "Caesar” worked as a photographer for the Syrian military, taking pictures of civilians tortured to death and documenting their cases. Who are the dead, what was their fate, and why did they disappear? Throughout Europe, the families of the victims, supported by international lawyers, activists and Caesar himself, are searching for truth and justice. They are investigating the Syrian death machine and the actions of its officials. Before the collapse of the regime in December 2024, this was both difficult and dangerous, there was always the risk that investigations based abroad could endanger further the lives of those behind Assad’s bars.

Is the enlightenment generated by meditation an altered state of consciousness, as much as can be induced by psychoactive chemicals like alcohol? Or is there something special about enlightenment that can illuminate the deep nature of consciousness and can even reach to ultimate levels of existence? Mystics make these grand claims.

The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals.A DNS lookup on the domain az.mastercard.com on Jan. 14, 2025 shows the mistyped domain name a22-65.akam.ne.From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider [DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in “akam.net” but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain “.”This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by , founder of the security consultancy Seralys. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of Niger.Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn’t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include “akam.ne,” but they were by far the largest.But the researcher said he didn’t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.“We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,” a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. “This typo has now been corrected.”Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through , a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via a post on LinkedIn (after he’d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.MasterCard’s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. “Titon” on infosec.exchange.Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.“I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,” Caturegli wrote in reply. “Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.” Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard’s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like  and .“So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,” Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or “Time To Live” — a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network — an attacker’s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.“With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,” he said.The researcher said he’d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.“We obviously disagree with this assessment,” Caturegli wrote in a follow-up post on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard’s public statement. “But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.”Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain.As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain . It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft’s  cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.“Don’t be like Mastercard,” Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. “Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.”One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously — in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an “Ivan I.” from Moscow. Passive DNS records from DomainTools.com show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.This is interesting given a comment on Caturegli’s LinkedIn post from an ex-Cloudflare employee who linked to a report he co-authored on a similar typo domain apparently registered in 2017 for organizations that may have mistyped their AWS DNS server as “” instead of “.” DomainTools reports that this typo domain also was registered to a Yandex user (playlotto@yandex.ru), and was hosted at the same German ISP — Team Internet (AS61969).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Stratoshark, a sibling application to Wireshark</title><link>https://stratoshark.org/</link><author>geraldcombs</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:25:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

About two-thirds of the nation’s crop-farm workers are foreign-born and, according to the labor department, roughly 42% of these immigrants are not legally authorized to work in the U.S. So how would removing these workers impact the food supply chain?

WSJ explores how Trump’s plans to deport millions could upend the agriculture industry.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There’s a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there’s no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn’t run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user’s data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don’t lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don’t like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here’s how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It’s easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it’s possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it’s necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn’t store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it’s stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user’s followers.Yet it’s expensive to push updates to each follower’s repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn’t index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user’s actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn’t contain this information. So the stream’s data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower’s repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here’s the workflow for displaying a post:A user’s request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server’s disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user’s unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‘bsky.social’ subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don’t affect their previous posts.A user’s DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user’s handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here’s how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user’s timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user’s repository doesn’t contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user’s timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed’s content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post’s timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result’s offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter’s window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it’s possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here’s how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay’s Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let’s dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won’t scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don’t use different CPU cores at once. So here’s how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user’s DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let’s take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it’s inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won’t scale for Bluesky’s needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it’s stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won’t scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap’s serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it’s a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it’s included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here’s how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user’s data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn’t store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user’s repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here’s how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server’s request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

He will be succeeded by Nikki Santoro, who has served as the chief operating officer since 2021. TechCrunch reports: Santoro's appointment is significant, as she is the first woman to become the CEO and only the second person to hold the position. Needham founded IMDb in 1990 at the age of 23, steering the company into a powerhouse within the entertainment industry. After 35 years, he'll transition to a new role as executive chair.
 
According to Needham, Santoro's ascension is well deserved. [...] Santoro has been with the company since 2016, leading the company in expanding its database and improving its IMDbPro membership. She previously held leadership positions at Amazon, Microsoft, and The Weather Channel. "Nikki's strategic vision, deep understanding of our customers and products, and commitment to innovation have already delivered impressive business results during her tenure as COO," said Needham in a statement. "Her track record of driving growth and enhancing our products and services makes her the ideal person to guide IMDb into a new era."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How WW1 Inspired The Lord of The Rings</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/tolkien-in-the-trenches-how-ww1-shaped-lord-of-the-rings</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6746005578f05cc6cc55e5d4/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BhhPK2bfU_hyRBJ8-JYzfJGAC_5vwJ7LDRNuGzt_o38" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:30:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ross Ulbricht granted a full pardon</title><link>https://twitter.com/Free_Ross/status/1881851923005165704</link><author>Ozarkian</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:10:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stargate Project: SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, MGX to build data centers</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41</link><author>tedsanders</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:29:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After Hitler: The Cleanup That Followed WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTRLhs9tI70</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gTRLhs9tI70?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary tells the story of the clean-up that followed WW2.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JS7UMDHz3Qc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice sit down with science writer Dava Sobel, author of a new book on Skłodowska-Curie, to explore the enduring impact of her work on radioactivity.

Discover how Skłodowska-Curie’s meticulous research led to the isolation of radium and polonium—elements that unlocked the mysteries of radioactivity and laid the foundation for modern physics and chemistry. Learn how her insights paved the way for radioactive dating, which determined the Earth’s age, and her revolutionary contributions to medical science, including the use of radium to treat cancer and the development of mobile X-ray units during World War I.

We dive into the science behind her two Nobel Prizes—one in physics and one in chemistry—and her perseverance in refining tiny quantities of radioactive material from tons of ore. We also discuss the risks she and her collaborators faced as the dangers of radiation exposure became clear, as well as the scientific advances inspired by her work, including the creation of artificial radioelements for medical applications.

From her early experiments to her lab notes—still radioactive today—Skłodowska-Curie’s story is one of unrelenting curiosity and dedication. Join us for a deep dive into the science that defined her career and the discoveries that continue to shape our understanding of the universe.

Elaine is from Brazil, Yassin is from Tunisia. Camera teams accompany the two for nine months in their new working environments.

Germany’s labor market desperately needs skilled workers - particularly in the medical sector. There’s also a high demand for professional drivers. That’s why many companies are recruiting internationally.

Elaine from Brazil worked as head of nursing at the emergency department and intensive care unit of a clinic in São Paulo. She’s married and has an eight-year-old son. She’s long dreamed of living in Europe; São Paulo’s high crime rate is one of the reasons why she’s keen to leave her homeland. "I can’t travel alone to early or late shifts. I’ll either be raped or robbed," she says. In Germany, she’s hoping for security and a better quality of life - something she’d like for her son in particular. Elaine initially goes to Düsseldorf alone; the family plans to join her later. But it won’t be easy for the Brazilian woman. Despite the language barrier, bureaucracy, and the loneliness that comes with being separated from her loved ones, can Elaine start to feel at home in Germany?
Yassin originates from Sousse, a Tunisian coastal city. After leaving fininshing his schooling, he worked there as a truck driver. In Tunisia, the only requirements for this job are a driving license and initial training. Things are different in Germany: Yassin is training as a professional driver for three-and-a-half years at a haulage company in Hesse. Tunisian driver’s licenses aren’t recognized in European countries, so he needs to pass the tests again. Yassin’s trainers describe him as ‘highly motivated and very good’. His final exam is coming up soon. Will the young man, who’s also learning German, make it as a skilled worker on the German labor market? If so, he’d like a small flat where he can invite friends round. His current room, which doesn’t have a kitchen, isn’t suitable - and hospitality is very important in his home country.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people’s diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

DESCRIPTION
Julian Wood and Tom Johnson explore the complexities of modern software development, with Tom sharing his journey from machine learning and distributed systems to founding Multiplayer, a company focused on simplifying development by automating documentation, debugging, and system design.

They discuss the challenges of building and managing complex software architectures, especially with microservices and cloud platforms, and the need for better tooling to address these issues. Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.

Together, they envision a world where better tools and AI lower the barrier to entry for developers, driving innovation and enabling more people to bring their ideas to life. [...]

The responses were overwhelmingly supportive: "Failure is just an event, not who you are." "Get back up and try again!" "This is valuable experience for next time."Fast forward to 2025. Another founder shares their journey of six failed attempts (link). The sentiment in the comments is strikingly different: "Would have been better to work at BigTech." "The rat race isn't worth it." "Most interesting stories remain buried while we're presented with a somewhat skewed reality."This shift isn't isolated to these two posts. The same forum that championed "fail fast, fail often" now regularly questions whether the startup path makes sense at all.The human cost has become more visible. Stories of burnout, failed relationships, and mental health struggles are no longer swept under the rug of "hustle culture."Big Tech compensation has transformed the risk-reward equation. When senior engineers can make $300K+ at established companies, the financial argument for startups becomes harder to justify.The VC model's limitations have become apparent. The focus on hypergrowth and exits has left many founders feeling trapped between authentic business building and investor expectations.The industry has matured. The low-hanging fruit of the mobile/web era has largely been picked, making truly innovative opportunities harder to find.I believe we're entering what might be called a "Startup Winter" - not because startups have stopped being created, but because the mythology around them has frozen over.What might emerge from this winter could be a startup ecosystem that's less glamorous but more authentic.

The first began with the  arcade game and is mostly used for side-scrolling  games, though not all of those games use that style. The second is a multicolor polygonal style, and though it’s primarily used for 3D  adventures now, it was introduced with .Most Mario games with polygonal logos have a different color per letter, but the sequence of colors in Mario’s name is rarely the  sequence across games.This captivated me—for some reason—and I set out to analyze every Mario video game logo to see if I could find a pattern for specific arrangements of colors and to determine the “most Mario” color scheme.Every logo in this analysis adheres to the following criteria:The title must be in the polygonal styleMario’s name must be in the titleMario’s name must be multicolorThe sequence of colors cannot be in rainbow orderDirect sequels that use the same sequence of colors  included, but re-releases are not. On that note, titles that were released on multiple platforms must have different logos and/or key art to have both included. (That means  on N64 and GBC are considered to be one logo.) Regional releases only count if each logo had a different sequence.With that out of the way, here’s a list of 40  games—in release order—showing which color was used for each letter in Mario’s name.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s IslandMario Golf: Toadstool TourMario Tennis: Ultra SmashMario + Rabbids: Kingdom BattleMario + Rabbids: Sparks of HopeThat question mark for  is because the O is a globe.Here are some initial observations:Though the first two instances had a  M, it was used only once more, for  in 2018.The most common color to be used  in Mario’s name is , followed by .The first time any logo had  was  in 2001.Let’s look at the total count per letter, per color to see what more we can learn.The letter M has almost always been .  is the most common color overall, with a whopping  in 40 logos. is also the most consistent choice for any letter, with 70% coverage for the letter A. is the least-used overall.  has never been used for A or R. has never been used for M or A. has never been used for O.Given this data, we can surmise the “most Mario” colors are:Though these exact sequences do occur, surprisingly, there are  sequences that show up just as often. Let’s see how many times an exact color sequence was used.Despite red being the most common  for the letter M, one of the most common  doesn’t have one. Most instances where the Mario logo begins with a blue M, it is this  sequence. Notable examples of this sequence are  and both  titles.Is  sequence in the running for the “most Mario”? Hard to say. Because another way to look at it is to find the most common sequence of the first  letters.From this perspective, the red-green-yellow-blue sequence is a lot more common than blue-green-yellow-red, making it the clear winner. That’s also in line with the most common color per letter we deduced earlier. Here are the 10 titles with that sequence, representing a quarter of all these logos.Mario Tennis: Ultra SmashMario + Rabbids: Kingdom BattleMario + Rabbids: Sparks of HopeSome notes about this selection:Two  games. Two  games. Two  games.The first with any of these sequences was 14 years ago.All of these games were released in a span of 11 years.Of these games, 9 out of 10 feature Peach on the box art. (Is that why pink is more commonly used lately?)This sequence is used on three major franchise games, four sports games, two crossovers, and a . All recent titles. Is this pattern, initially set by , the “most Mario” color sequence?Let’s look at one more thing: The Super Mario Bros. Movie.The Super Mario Bros. MovieWas this useful for me? For you? For ? Probably not. Has Nintendo done a similar analysis to help determine the coloration for the film logo? Maybe. Or maybe it’s just what  looks like lately.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s an API?</title><link>https://blog.algomaster.io/p/whats-an-api</link><author>Ashish Pratap Singh</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae14a376-92a3-4ff6-a329-8e4f2a7ac9b5_1546x1074.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 05:31:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://blog.algomaster.io/">Dev - Algomaster</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[API stands for Application Programming Interface.At its core, an API is a  that takes an  and gives you predictable Think of an API as a  that enables applications to interact without needing direct access to each other's code or database.Almost every digital service you use today—social media, e-commerce, online banking, ride-hailing apps—all of them are a bunch of APIs working together. – If you provide a city name as input (), the API returns the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. – If you provide a pickup and destination address, the API finds the  and calculates the estimated fare. – If you provide a list of numbers (), the API returns the  ().When engineers build APIs, they clearly define what inputs the API accepts and , ensuring consistent behavior across different applications.APIs follow a simple  model:A client (such as a web app or mobile app) makes a request to an API.The API (hosted on an API server) processes the request, interacts with the necessary databases or services, and prepares a response.The API sends the response back to the client in a structured format (usually JSON or XML).Every API requires , and passing incorrect data can result in errors.For example: If you tried putting your name into the Google Maps API as an input, that wouldn’t work very well.Some APIs also require inputs in a specific format.Example: The  might need the input as  instead of .APIs often  to ensure they are correct before processing them, which helps maintain .Just as APIs require , they also return .For example, the  always returns coordinates in the same format.{

}The apps you use every day—whether it's Gmail, Instagram, Uber, or Spotify—are essentially a collection of APIs with a polished user interface (UI) on top.Most applications follow the frontend/backend architecture, where:The  consists of APIs that handle data processing, business logic, and communication with databases.The  is a graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with these APIs, making applications user-friendly and accessible without requiring users to write code.Let’s break this down with a real-world example: .Before the Uber app existed as a sleek, user-friendly experience, the company first built the core APIs that power ride-hailing services:Calculating Fares & RoutesMatching Riders & DriversThese APIs run on Uber’s servers, forming the . Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed—Open APIs and Internal APIs—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python’s built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4]
numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element

fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" }
]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <bank:GetAccountBalance>
         <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>
      </bank:GetAccountBalance>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Body>
      <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>
         <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>
      </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      likes
    }
  }
}{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "posts": [
        { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },
        { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }
      ]
    }
  }
}gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here’s a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests

url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C")
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code) – Sends an API request. – Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 – Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don’t always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}")
elif response.status_code == 401:
    print("Error: Invalid API key")
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print("Error: City not found")
else:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Inauguration</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UL4WIxvmG0</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2UL4WIxvmG0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 00:42:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To rent our new movie 'Dear Kelly' for $5.55, head over to https://www.dearkellyfilm.com/ ...

subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture:
Enhancements.In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten
Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject.The Enhancements subprojectFrederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements
subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject’s work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).: We’re currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reverse engineering Call of Duty anti-cheat</title><link>https://ssno.cc/posts/reversing-tac-1-4-2025/</link><author>deverton</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 23:07:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been reversing Black Ops Cold War for a while now, and I’ve finally decided to share my research regarding the user-mode anti-cheat inside the game. It’s not my intention to shame or promote cheating/bypassing of the anti-cheat, so I’ve redacted a few things.To clear up any confusion, Black Ops Cold War does not have the kernel-mode component of Ricochet that Modern Warfare (2019) and later titles have. I’ll be referring to the anti-cheat as TAC (Treyarch Anti-Cheat) as the game I reversed is a Treyarch game. Also, whenever I provide function pseudocode, it will be the best I can do since the actual decompilation is super cluttered with a lot of junk/resolving code. The biggest difference between the newer games is the kernel-mode driver, while the majority of anti-cheat code is user-mode and very similar to TAC.Let’s look at how the anti-cheat and the game is protected before we dig too deep.Arxan is an obfuscation/protection tool that’s used on many Call of Duty games, most of which are anything past Black Ops 3. Which includes many features, that make cheaters/reverse engineers’ life a lot harder.Runtime Executable DecryptionThe game executable is packed and encrypted; Arxan inserts code during the startup process to unpack and decrypt the game executable.Arxan is constantly monitoring the game executable for any patches.If you want to learn more about these, momo5502 has a great blog post which can be found hereWhenever Arxan detects a debugger or a checksum mismatch, it will terminate the process.Arxan can take a function and all of its instructions and separate them with a jmp.This is also useful to hide where a function is called from, it breaks IDA and requires an external tool to sift through the instructions.
This is difficult to analyze statically, especially whenever it’s a giant function that’s been planted with hundreds of jumps.It’s really difficult to follow the entry point on Arxan-protected games; first, you have the protected Arxan code that unpacks and executes the game’s real entry point, which jmp obfuscation can also be planted in here, making it extremely difficult to understand what’s going on.Now we that understand how the game and anti-cheat are protected we can dig deeper.
TAC is planted directly into the game executable, uses no kernel components, and will also terminate the process if debug artifacts are found.How does TAC detect monitoring?TAC is designed for Windows; this means it’s going to be using Windows-specific APIs for the anti-cheat.The hook detection used here is pretty basic, and it’s currently only checking for 7 patterns. It looks like they have just taken previous cheats’ hook stubs and put them in.NOTE: Each time I provide example code, every API called in that example code is what TAC is using, is being checked for hooks, and is being resolved by their runtime hash lookup. Also, most of TAC is heavily inlined.Here’s how these checks are implemented. Those 0x0 spots in the assembly are 8 bytes because this is x64.
Runtime API Export LookupTAC has an inlined API lookup function; it takes the module hash and the API name hash, iterates the current list of loaded modules, hashes the name, then goes through each exported function from that module and compares it to the compile-time hash of the API they want.This is what the decomp looks like.
Here’s a recreation of their runtime lookup.How can we figure out what these hashes are?The answer is super simple; I grabbed a list of all the loaded modules in my game process and copied over the game’s hashing function (note: dll names are hashed a little bit differently), which can be seen here.I took that function and calculated the hash of all the module names and exports from the module list that I grabbed, then created a function to look up these API names by using the FNV hash base and the inlined hash of the API name.Here’s how I managed to cache and resolve all of the exports.After all of this, it was time to do some manual work.
I went in by hand and grabbed the base hashes and function hashes from the decompilation then put those into my program.Now I was able to tell exactly which APIs the anti-cheat was calling.Here’s how my tool ended up working.I do want to mention that these hashes aren’t going to be the same in different versions of the game.
Also, this isn’t the only way of beating this hashing technique; these function pointers are stored in global variables; you can simply inspect them and match the virtual address of the function to one of the exported functions from all of the DLLs loaded.Ok, now we have established that TAC detects API hooking (It only checks functions that it uses, not actually checking all important APIs for hooks, just the ones it’s using). These are only here to monitor API hooking attempts that would hurt or prevent the anti-cheat from doing its job.What if there was a hooking method that bypassed their hooking detections?For actual cheaters trying to hook into the game, Arxan has got the code patching covered; cheaters must use non-code patching hooking methods while Arxan is present.
There are a couple of these hooking methods, and I’ll list a few here:Exception hooking - Forcefully triggering an exception and handling it.
Exceptions can be triggered in multiple ways.Modify a global pointer to be a nullptr or invalid memory address.Modify page access protections to trigger an access exception (Example: PAGE_NOACCESS or PAGE_GUARD).Debug registers - telling the CPU to break (throw a STATUS_SINGLE_STEP exception) on a specific instruction.
These are very powerful; the CPU can break on any or all of these conditions for a given instruction address.
Debug registers are the easiest to use, the most popular, and the easiest to detect!Since debug registers are so popular and powerful, and completely bypass Arxan’s .text patch monitoring, this makes them the perfect hooking technique for Call of Duty games.Here’s how TAC checks for debug registers.Since debug registers are in the DR0-DR3 registers, you can’t just write some custom assembly to directly read them because these registers are privileged and must be fetched by the Windows kernel or sent to the process by Windows whenever an exception occurs.Driver Signing EnforcementWindows has a test mode, which is designed for driver development.This will allow you to bypass the normal Windows restriction on kernel-mode drivers not having valid digital signatures.This is a protection mechanism in place to prevent bad actors from running kernel mode drivers on your system without the proper authorization.TAC will know if you have test mode enabled on Windows, via ntdll!NtQuerySystemInformation. This isn’t going to ban you directly, but this will have your account flagged.Now we understand some of TAC’s anti-static analysis and debug register detection tactics. We’re going to move on to the more advanced detections implemented into TAC.How does TAC exit the process?TAC uses two ways of exiting the process; both of them clear the registers, and these are written in inline shellcode.
The first method sets RCX to -1 as it calls NtTerminateProcess.TAC will not use this method if NtTerminateProcess is detected to be hooked.If NtTerminateProcess is hooked, it’ll go to the second one, which jumps to 0x0.Here’s the second method; we can see the same register clearing, and we see a jmp. This jump goes to 0x0, which will crash the process.These are hard to recover from since all of the important registers are cleared.
The code for generating and running these shellcodes is provided here.Oftentimes, internal cheaters will allocate a console using AllocConsole to print their debug logs to, or even make their menu in it using print statements.
The PEB (Process Environment Block) contains information regarding the allocation of a console.
The PEB contains a ton of useful information regarding the process. If you want to read more about this click here; most of this structure is undocumented, but that’ll take you to the MSDN page.The game knows that there shouldn’t ever be a console window allocated; checking for one is super simple and will catch some people who use this method of logging. Here’s the implementation.
Cheaters need to draw on the screen if they want a working  or even a .How do they do this?
There are a few ways of drawing on the screen; the most common method for internal cheats is to hook whichever graphics API the game is using and draw their information in there.Modern Call of Duty games are made with .The present function is what presents the rendered game image to the user. The idea is you add your custom data to the image before it’s presented to the user, update the image then present it to the user.How is this detected?
First, we need to understand how these functions are hooked.
The  functions are inside of the  DLL on your computer.DirectX interfaces hold vtables which will point to the functions inside of dxgi, these vtable indexes will be the same across the versions of windows.This can either be directly hooked, or pointer swapped.Detecting these hooks.
Something that can be done is to scan the DXGI present function, but TAC doesn’t currently do this.TAC checks the present pointer in the vtable. introduced command queues; whenever the game is drawing something, it’s from the command queue, a list of draw commands. This is something cheaters will also need if they want to draw.
How do cheaters get this command queue?
Since this is an interface, the methods will have a  pointer passed as the first parameter; in this case, that pointer is the command queue.Cool information:
Many things such as OBS Studio/Streamlabs OBS/Discords game overlay/Steams game overlay actually all do this, while Steam and Discord draw here, things like OBS studio are just here to capture the rendered image (capture the frames) and save them into your recording. This only happens if you use game capture on recording software.Cheaters can ignore the game, and simply hook into Discord/steam and draw things there if they want to.What about External Cheats?External cheats are most likely going to create an overlapped window that covers the width and height of the game window. There are a few ways to detect this; the detection methods heavily rely on Windows APIs and require more effort to implement.TAC loops through all of the windows, checking their window style for   using GetWindowLongA; once it finds that, it then compares that window’s rect with the game rect using GetWindowRect.After all of that, if the window is over the game’s rect and it is a layered window, the hwnd to that window will be cached, which will later be used for many string checks. This stores a bunch of information and uploads it to their servers.Here we can see how that works.We can see 0x780 and 0x438, which represent 1920 by 1080, which was my screen size.

Okay, so we know the windows are cached. Now what?The cached list is handled in another function that checks the window text and its class names.Cheat developers can hide their overlapping windows from recording software, and screenshot tools using SetWindowDisplayAffinity with .This is checked by TAC, and it’s saved into the buffer that will be uploaded to their servers later.
There are a couple more things related to the window that are uploaded as well.
The normal window style is also checked; you can find more here.TAC checks that the window is visible first before any more processing happens on it.TAC also stores the list of modules, including the exe name of the overlapping window.When you do anything in Windows to another process, you need to have permission; Windows has an API that will let you request permission from the system. OpenProcessThe first parameter in OpenProcess is the access desired, since this is a bitmask our reversing software will just show us 0x410 by default, but that doesn’t do us any good!This can be figured out with some IDA magic.Creating a bitmask structure in IDA Pro and setting that as the function declaration’s first parameter helps us out.
Here’s the resulting code we get from IDA.As you can see, TAC wants to read the overlapping process’ virtual memory, and it wants to query information about the process.This is the access level you would expect for enumerating process modules. example.Then the strings are encrypted and stored into the encryption buffer.Here’s what the majority of the code looks like.Example data. TAC will format in json with modules hashed.
Cheat Engine is one of the easiest programs to detect, and it’s really because of how virtual memory works in Windows.Whenever a program wants to allocate virtual memory, they’re going to call the Windows API VirtualAlloc.
This memory is allocated, but it’s not backed by any physical memory yet because it hasn’t been accessed, this is a feature in the Windows kernel.This allows the game to allocate virtual memory with that function and never use it.After Cheat Engine scans the process, it will hit this virtual memory, which will then make that memory valid, because now it has been accessed by Cheat Engine.
Here’s how that detection would look, and this is for any memory scanner, not just Cheat Engine. This will also include the Process Hacker memory tab.Game hackers love signatures; whenever the game updates, no problem the cheat will automatically update.
Treyarch had a pretty interesting idea.Their idea is to create a function that’ll never be called again; this function will call another function that protects the return address with PAGE_NOACCESS. Since this will never be reached again by the program, this isn’t an issue.The way sig scanners work is they attempt to match a signature by reading bytes in the executable. It’s extremely slow to query each byte you are going to be reading, which is why this is such a good method. You can read more about VirtualProtect here.
It’s not undefeatable, but it’s something that’s there and will probably give most a hard time.Here’s a good example of code that’ll never be reached again. (The program will never reach the top of the main function again.)The scan pattern function will start at the base of the executable and continue to the end until it finds the pattern it wants, ultimately hitting the PAGE_NOACCESS memory, and crashing the process.TAC has a simple anti-debug check; but remember, Arxan is still running, so they still have all of those anti-debugging tricks.How does TAC prevent debugging?
TAC loops through all threads in the current process by using CreateToolHelpSnapshot32 with SnapThread passed and checks the thread for a DebugObject, which is going to be present if a debugger is running.A weird anti-debug trick.
It throws an access violation by writing to invalid memory; if the code ever gets past the exception, a debugger got past it or handled the exception properly.Standard API check
Monitoring Network TrafficThis is a super cool detection method used for some cheats, and don’t be alarmed by this; they do not store any of your active connections; they are only looking for a very specific check.
A cheater can write shellcode into the game process that starts a network server inside of the game process on the local network, then the cheater can have their external application send and receive information to this local server, kind of like a local command and control center.
Here’s how it’s implemented.Encrypted Custom SyscallsWhenever you look at exported APIs in ntdll, you’ll notice most of them do a syscall.A syscall is what moves over into the kernel, where the actual implementation of the function is.This is what a syscall stub looks like.IMO this is the coolest feature TAC has!
Writing your own syscall stub has a purpose. Whenever a user-mode cheat hooks those ntdll functions that syscall, it’ll work, but their hooks can be bypassed very easily if the anti-cheat just calls the syscall instruction with eax set to the same syscall index as the normal function.Syscalls are vulnerable to instrumentation callbacks; these are callbacks coded into Windows, and they will work on every single user-mode process.These callbacks will catch every syscall instruction and every exception.
Just an FYI, instrumentation callbacks are called AFTER the syscall; their return address will be right after the syscall instruction.This would normally allow cheaters to easily see where every syscall is coming from since all of the functions using it are just exported in ntdll.It fails because the cheater will see a syscall from a random ntdll function, rather than the anti-cheat code.If you want to see instrumentations in action, you can do so here.At a quick glance, this is very confusing and hard to figure out statically.They even make it confusing to see what memory is being written to.It turned out to be pretty simple to figure this out and understand exactly how it works.That memory being written to is actually a large chunk allocated in the .text section that they just virtual protect for write/execute rights.Now we could spend all day in our XOR calculator and try to build the byte array of these XOR encrypted instructions ourselves.Or we could just let the computer do it….This was pretty much just copy and paste from IDA Pro, all I did was allocate my own memory here.Inspecting this memory address reveals the unencrypted shellcode and we can see the standard syscall stub here.
Starting with the “mov r10, rcx” instruction.Following that jmp after the mov, 0x2C is the NtTerminateProcess syscall index for my Windows version, and we can see that being moved into eax.
Following the jump after mov eax, this is where the address of the syscall instruction comes in; it’s just a jump to it.
We can take a look at where this syscall instruction is located, just to verify that it’s a bit random.
And just to double-check, if we run the code again, our syscall instruction location will change!
This is a lot, so let’s recap quickly.Why would you use a custom syscall stub?This will completely bypass cheaters hooking ntdll functions.What’s going on with the NtReadFile stuff?TAC is actually searching for the syscall instruction; their encrypted syscall stub is designed to actually fake where syscalls are coming from, the CPU time is the RNG factor.Example: Someone monitoring the process will see that a syscall happened from NtReadFile, so they’ll do some inspecting and try to cover up anything NtReadFile would expose of theirs, but the syscall wasn’t even NtReadFile. The actual syscall could have been anything; the cheater will never know unless they’re able to inspect the eax register after the syscall (which should be cleared out and replaced with the NTSTATUS code). This is really cool; an attacker won’t have any way of knowing what syscall instruction to monitor.A good way to monitor these would be preventing page execute protections, and looking at the exception, this is what the stub looks like in Ida Pro.
Just for bonus points, I’ve recreated their syscalling method.Let’s test this just to make sure.We can see this is working exactly how it should! Again, this is clever and even more effective; cheaters will have no clue which syscall instruction to watch out for.Detecting Anti-Debugger-Hiding AttemptsIt’s common for anti-debugging or anti-cheat threads to set  to true.Whenever a thread has  set, any exceptions thrown from that thread will skip past a debugger and crash the process or be handled in the process’s structured exception handling.Which means this flag is pretty important, and you want to make sure someone isn’t spying on your activity.TAC has a pretty interesting approach to detecting hooks for this.
To set , the API  must be called.Cheaters can hook this and just return TRUE whenever  is being requested. This will make the anti-cheat think it has been successfully hidden even though nothing happened.This method detects poorly made hooks.This is the result when running under x64dbg with ScyllaHide.
And this is the result without a debugger and without ScyllaHide.
Create Remote Thread BlockingTAC installs an exception handler that just calls TerminateThread on the STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION exception code.There’s a good reason for this; when cheaters manually map their DLL, they need a way to get the remote process to actually run the shellcode they wrote. One of the most common ways of doing this is CreateRemoteThread, which just allows the cheater to have a newly created thread that immediately executes their shellcode.How is it detected?:
TLS callbacks are callbacks that can be planted inside of a Windows PE file; these callbacks are called before the thread’s entry point whenever a thread is created.Here’s how that works; keep in mind that we are running in the current thread context of the newly created thread.Dumping Exception HandlersFor those interested in how I dumped the exception handlers, I’ve provided the code.
You’ll need to update these offsets if you want to use this.I’m not sure what this is, but it looks like something that would flag virtual machines or custom versions of Windows.Since TAC is so reliant on the linked module list, they have a check that prevents someone from setting it to an empty list. Setting this to an empty list will probably break the process anyway.TAC is a pretty cool user-mode anti-cheat, with features such as runtime API lookups, detecting poorly made hooks by passing clever invalid parameters, external overlay detection, internal DirectX hook detection, checking APIs that it uses for hooks, checking for debuggers and debugging artifacts, AllocConsole detection, CreateRemoteThread detection, and the coolest of all, spoofed and encrypted syscall stubs. Arxan really helps out TAC; it has powerful obfuscation, anti-static analysis methods, and a couple of features that break IDA Pro, all while monitoring the executable for .text modifications. It even has its own anti-debug techniques built-in. Similar code from TAC is being used in modern Call of Duty games. Overall, this was a huge learning experience, and a great challenge, and pretty unreal to see all the things that caught me! I hope you found my research interesting. I’m still not 100% done reversing the anti-cheat, so you can expect to see new information posted here sometime in the future! :)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/128/changelog-news-128.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the “personal” back in “personal computer”, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

have had a less stressful life knowing that even a long string of 
failures in specific endeavors doesn't necessarily translate to
failure in life.  Maybe some version of my younger self is still out there and will get some similar value out of it.Growing up, I had two major life ambitions: to become a tenured university professor, and to found a successful startup company.  My role models were people like Rodney Brooks (who was on my Ph.D. thesis committee) who made a big splash in the AI/Robotics world in the early 1990s with the Subsumption Architecture, and was a co-founder of Lucid and iRobot.I didn't accomplish either of those goals.  I never even got an interview for an academic job, let alone tenure.  I made six (and a half) attempts to found a startup.  All of them failed.Failure #0: Professor RonIn elementary school, my ambition was to be a doctor, specifically a brain surgeon.  That dream died in high school biology class when we had to dissect fetal pigs and I discovered that I was a lot more squeamish than I had thought.  So I traded my surgical scrubs for a computer keyboard and set my sights on AI instead.  Fast-forward to 1991, when a freshly minted PH.D. started sending out curriculum vitae (that's academic-speak for "resumes") to CS departments.  Unfortunately, my timing could not have been worse.  It was the height of AI Winter and the first Bush recession, and the few universities that were hiring were getting hundreds of applications for single openings.  My publication record was not great.  I hadn't published a single journal article.  My main conference publication (PDF is here) was well received, but (apparently) insufficiently academic for academia.  I didn't even get an interview.So I just stayed where I was, which was JPL.  I've told that story elsewhere so I won't repeat it here.  Suffice to say, my JPL career had ups and downs, but eventually entered a long and steady decline from which it never recovered.  But the  that my career declined had nothing to do with JPL or any external circumstance, it happened because I gradually came to realize that scientific research was not what I had imagined it to be.  In the real world, research is not a Platonic quest for objective truth. It is, first and foremost, a human endeavor, deeply intertwined with human ambitions and foibles, including my own.  The reason my career lasted as long as it did was that I learned, at least to a certain extent, how to work the system.  I was nominally successful, eventually becoming the most cited AI researcher in all of NASA according to a popular metric at the time (Citeseer).  But as time went by I became less and less proud of the work I was doing, and the entire field seemed mired in a stasis that I felt powerless to dislodge.  So I quit.Lesson learned: academic research is no panacea.  (I think things are actually worse now than they were in my day.)I spent the summer of 1990 as a visiting graduate student in Rodney Brooks's lab at MIT.  While there I met a brilliant hardware engineer named Mike Ciholas, who went on to found a company that today employs dozens of people and bears his name.  He pitched an idea to me for a new design for a computer network that he called FlowNet (full text is here).  We built working prototypes.  If they had gone into production they would have had more than an order of magnitude price-performance advantage over the competition at the time.  We had numerous meetings with VC's, but none of them ever gave us a term sheet, probably because they knew what we did not: Fast Ethernet was coming, and although it would be expensive at first, it would quickly get commodified and beat out any potential competition no matter how technically superior it might be.  We built our prototypes in 1993.  Fast Ethernet came out in 1995.  We folded up the tent in 1997.Lesson learned: direct frontal assaults on infrastructure and standards are very unlikely to succeed.  More worthy players than us have learned this lesson the hard way over the years.In 2000 I went to work for an obscure little Silicon Valley startup company.  I've told that story elsewhere so I won't tell it again, but I wanted to mention it for two reasons.  First, it sets the stage for what was to come, and second, while it was unquestionably a success, it was not  success.  In fact, on a personal level I count Google as a failure as well.  My tenure there was marked by a long series of screwups, and I had a serious case of impostor syndrome.    I lasted a year, but after that I went back to JPL to bide my time until the IPO.The Google IPO allowed me to quit JPL and pursue my entrepreneurial ambitions more seriously.  With the benefit of hindsight I should have moved to Northern California and hung out at Y Combinator, but I had lived in Los Angeles for 17 years at that point, which was longer than any place else I had ever lived before by a wide margin.  By my standards at the time, I had deep roots there.  I have also always had a love for magic and movies, and Los Angeles was the epicenter of both of those industries.  So I decided to try to do something in the entertainment space.The result of that was a company called IndieBuyer, which was going to be Netflix for independent films.  The idea was that technology was making filmmaking more and more accessible, leading to a long tail of undervalued product that couldn't find an audience because of the bottleneck presented by a distribution system designed for more capital-intensive projects.  The business model was that we would sell DVDs (which were still very much a thing back then) but with a money-back guarantee: if you bought a DVD that we recommended and you didn't like it, you could return it for a full refund.  The returns would provide the data for a recommendation engine that would, we hoped, over time become a better and better predictor of who would like what kinds of movies.  The long-term business model was to intelligently match niche products with niche audiences at scale.It was a plausible idea, and it might have even worked if we had been better capitalized.  But I was funding it entirely from my own pocket, and after a couple of years with very little growth I lost my nerve and decided to pull the plug.  We did try to find some outside investors, but because we had already launched and weren't showing much traction, we didn't attract any interest.Lesson learned: it's really hard to make money in the movie business.This is the half-failure alluded to in the title.  I count it as half a failure because, although I was actively involved, I was not a founder.  Evryx (which eventually rebranded itself as SnapNow) was founded by another engineer at JPL.  The company was an early pioneer in reverse image search.  It used an algorithm called SIFT to match an image taken with a cell phone to a library of stored images and provide information about whatever was in the image.  I was never entirely clear on what the business model was intended to be, but the technology seemed cool.  I happened to mention it in passing to a friend of mine whom I had met at a political fundraiser.  He looked into it and got sufficiently excited about it to become their CEO.  The founder became CTO.About a year later the company had a crisis: the founder/CTO was behaving erratically, and my friend, the CEO, decided he had to fire him.  He tapped me to come aboard as acting CTO until a permanent replacement could be recruited.  The company limped along for another year or so but ultimately folded in 2007, in no small measure because of the fallout from the financial crisis that began that year.  The CEO had actually managed to secure another round of funding, but it was voted down at a shareholder meeting, with the (fired) CTO casting the deciding vote against.  The company folded a few weeks later.  The bankrupt entity was eventually acquired at a fire-sale price by a private investor, and I have no idea what happened to it after that.  It was sitting on some potentially valuable IP, so maybe they were able to do something with it.Lesson learned: even smart people can do incredibly stupid things.  The CTO said he voted against the financing because he didn't like the terms and didn't want to be diluted.  The result was that his intact share of the company ended up being worthless.(I actually saw a similar thing play out at another company in which I was a passive investor.  The technical co-founders basically torpedoed the company, but in their case they went on to start a new company with the exact same IP and business model.  It was blatantly illegal, but to that point the company was funded entirely by small angel investors, and no one was willing to put up the resources to try to stop them.  So they got away with it.)In 2009 my wife and I took a cruise around the Pacific rim.  At one point we ended up in Saigon and needed to get back to the cruise ship, but couldn’t find a taxi.  I thought to myself: this place is chock-full of taxi drivers, all of whom have cell phones, and many of whom have smart phones.  Someone should write an app that would let me broadcast the fact that I'm standing in this location looking for a ride.  It was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick had the exact same idea at the exact same time.  I founded a company called iCab, and they founded a company called Ubercab, which eventually changed its name to Uber.iCab was stillborn.  It was never even established as an actual company.  I assembled a team, mainly people I knew from Evryx, and wrote a prototype app which actually worked.  But we couldn't figure out a way to procure drivers.  We were in LA and we tried pitching the idea to cab companies, but they were not interested.  The idea of using black car limos never even occurred to me.  With no supply chain, we folded up the tent before we had even pitched it.Lesson learned: a brilliant idea is not enough.  You have to execute.  And sometimes that requires another brilliant idea.Failure #4: Virgin Charter (nee Smart Charter)In 2010 my wife and I decided to get an apartment in Santa Monica so we could spend more time by the beach.  I started hanging out in the offices of a venture capital firm with an office on the Third Street Promenade.  One day a fellow named Scott Duffy walked into the office and asked if he could hire us to do due diligence on an acquisition he was considering.  I don't remember the name of the company, but it collected business intelligence on the private aviation industry.In the course of conducting this due diligence we learned that the private jet market is incredibly fragmented and inefficient, with dozens of operators most of whom had only a small handful of planes.  At the time there were a few thousand private jets operating as charters, but there were only three operators with fleets of more than 100 planes.  The largest of these was NetJets with (if memory serves) about 250, only about 10% of the total.To match customers with aircraft, a secondary industry of brokers had cropped up.  If you wanted to charter a jet you would call up a broker, give them your mission parameters, and then they would start making phone calls and sending emails and faxes (yes, fax was still a thing back then) to try to find a matching aircraft.  The turnaround time to get a quote was measured in hours, and actually securing a reservation could take days.But even worse than the time involved was the fact that when an aircraft took you somewhere, it eventually had to return to its home base.  Most of the time this happened in one of two ways: you either paid to have the aircraft (and its crew) wait for you and take you back, or you had to pay for two round trips.  About 40% of legs flown by private jets were flown empty.  This led to a secondary market of brokers trying to sell these empty legs, which had already been paid for.  If you were lucky and happened to find one that was flying a route that you wanted to travel, you could pick one up for a song.  The empty flight was already paid for, so any revenue at all was pure profit.The problem is that most of the customer base for private jets want to go where and when they want to go, not where and when a plane happens to be available, so it was rare to actually sell an empty leg.  But if you've ever wanted to fly on a private jet and you are flexible with regards to your timing and route, you could (and still can) find some very good deals.One man's inefficiency is always another man's business opportunity.  I realized that the problem was the lack of a centralized clearing house for demand.  If we could somehow collect all the data on who wanted to go where and when, we could route the fleet much more efficiently.  We crunched the numbers and it turned out to be a billion-dollar business -- if we could somehow pull it off.  The problem was that the customers and the suppliers all depended on the brokers.  In order to succeed we wold need to wrest both away.  How to do it?I came up with the following diabolical plan: build a web site that would let people enter their trip details, and then give access to that data to the brokers as a lead generation service for a very modest fee.  The fee was actually a red herring to disguise the fact that we were secretly plotting to put the brokers out of business.  It would be an offer they couldn't refuse: more customers for a small amount of money.  But once we reached a critical mass of users, we would start phase two: offer that lead data directly to charter operators so they could bypass the brokers.  Again, it would be an offer they could not refuse.  We would offer these leads to the operators for free, and it would be a much faster and more efficient way of getting bookings because the whole process would be automated.  As a bonus, they could pocket what would have been the broker's commission.Finally, once we had a critical mass of operators on board, we would start phase 3, a centralized scheduling service that would dispatch the entire fleet in order to minimize the number of empty legs being flown.  Again, it would be an offer they couldn't refuse.  Anyone who didn't subscribe would have to charge significantly more for the same product in order to pay for the additional empty legs, and market forces would eventually drive all the customers to us.To this day I'm pretty sure that plan would have worked if we had actually executed it.  It was a brilliant plan if I do say so myself.  In fact, it was so brilliant that it convinced Richard Branson to acquire the company  for $10M.  We started the company as Smart Charter, but we launched as Virgin Charter.I vehemently opposed the acquisition, but I was overridden by my two co-founders.  When I lost that fight, I resigned from the company, but I kept my shares on the off chance that my intuitions were wrong and Virgin would actually make it work.  Unfortunately, my fears were well-founded.  As soon as they took over, they changed the business model to be directly consumer-facing, because that is Virgin's strength.  Instead of a stealthy three-phase plan, they went for a direct assault on an established industry with very little understanding of the actual dynamics of that industry.  Charter jets are a very rarified market.  There's a lot of dollars involved, but not a whole lot of people, and those people don't like to be treated like ordinary consumers.At our peak we had dozens of sales people.  They all sat around the office with almost nothing to do.  This was made all the more ironic by the fact that the original business model required fewer than ten people and probably could have been run on a single server.  Even at 100% market share, the volumes in private jets are just not that high.Lesson learned: Be careful who you take on as a partner.  Success in one industry does not necessarily translate into success in another.  This is another lesson that others have learned the hard way.Failure #5: Founder's ForgeAfter being stung so hard by the private jet fiasco, I decided to design a business that I could run entirely without partners.   This was around the time that Bitcoin first appeared, though it would still be many, many years before it broke out of hacker circles and into public awareness.  I had always been interested in cryptography, and there were parts of Bitcoin's technology that I found very appealing, particularly its use of public-key cryptography and digital signatures.  I foresaw increasing problems with credit card fraud because of the fact that the protocol was fundamentally broken: the credentials that you use to authorize a transaction are not bound to that transaction.  They can be re-used.  This is still the basis of most credit card fraud today, and it's the reason your card has a chip in it.  That chip has a secret key in it, and it computes digital signatures.  That makes it impossible to re-use the authorization for one transaction on a different transaction, and makes the credentials in general harder (but still not impossible) to steal.The problem is that you can't use that chip for e-commerce.  It's not because this is  impossible, it's just that the infrastructure to do it doesn't exist.  There is no reason you could not have a card reader peripheral plugged into a USB port that would execute the same protocol that point-of-sale terminals use and provide the same protection.  In fact, there is no reason why you even need any hardware at all.  The entire protocol could be executed entirely in software on your computer or smart phone.  It would cost next to nothing and it would eliminate most credit card fraud.  So why hasn't it been done?It is because the process is controlled by the banks, and the banks don't care.  Why don't the banks care?  Because they treat the cost of fraud as just another cost of doing business, and they pass it along to you, the consumer.  And they do it in a diabolical, stealthy way that you don't notice.  But that's another story.  Back in the day, I was not yet aware of all this.  I thought that fixing credit card fraud would be, if not welcomed, at least not actively opposed.  I was wrong.I knew that the banks controlled the credit card system, and I knew they comprised a massive, ossified industry that was going to be next to impossible to penetrate.  So I came up with a plan that would hide the fact that I was trying to solve credit card fraud by presenting it as a completely different product addressing a completely different problem and market.The idea was this: by this time I had a fair amount of experience starting and running companies, and one of the "pain points" was financial record-keeping.  Making sure the books were up to date was a sufficiently serious chore that most companies employed an entire team of people to do it.  (There's a reason that "the finance department" is a thing.)The fundamental reason that record-keeping is a chore is that the records are decoupled from the transactions they record.  This is for historical reasons.  You can easily hand someone a dollar, or write them a check, or swipe your credit card without writing down that you did these things.  In the vast majority of cases you have to  connect the record of a transaction with the actual transaction itself.But in an age where most transactions are electronic, this doesn't have to be the case.  There is no reason why you can't build an interface in which the authorization and the record-keeping are one and the same operation, and if you do that, they cannot fall out of sync.  So the idea was to provide a service that coupled transactions and record-keeping to guarantee that they always remained in sync.  And the interface to the authorization system would quietly use digital signatures as the authorization mechanism.  The users of the system would mostly be unaware that there were digital signatures happening under the hood, just as the users of chipped credit cards are mostly unaware of this.The company was called "Founders Forge" because the initial target market was going to be startup companies.  The name was a play on "SourceForge", the then-popular open-source hosting site.  But all of that was a red herring because the real plan was to replace credit cards with digital signatures for e-commerce.Of course, to make all this work I needed a way to move money around, and for this I needed a bank.  I always knew that was going to be the heavy-lift so I focused on that early, long before I had even a prototype product ready to launch.  As things happened, I never even built a prototype because the banks turned out to be an impenetrable brick wall, but that impenetrability manifested itself in a very unexpected way.I approached banks with the following pitch: I am building an accounting system for startup companies, and I want to link it with their actual financial transactions.  So I need access to an API to allow me to authorize transactions on my client's behalf.  The clients will authorize me as their agent so it will all be on the up-and-up.  The benefit for the bank is that I would funnel them a steady stream of new business in the form of the most promising Silicon Valley startup companies.Somewhat to my surprise, this pitch was very well received.  I got positive responses and follow-up meetings from half a dozen different banks, and I thought I was on my way.But then events took a very unexpected turn.  One by one, every bank that had initially responded positively changed their minds.  Worse, not a single one of them would tell me why.  They said, "Sorry, turns out we can't do it" and then stopped returning my calls.  In one case I actually got as high as the bank's CTO, who seemed very excited about the idea, but then he too suddenly backed off.  At that point I decided to quit, and went into a deep existential crisis for a while.  I had been working on Founders Forge for about six years.I never got a straight answer from any of the banks about why they changed their minds.Lesson learned: never underestimate the capacity of the banking industry to stifle innovation.  (Also, it really does appear to be run by a shadowy cabal of people you will likely never meet.)Failure #6: Spark InnovationsI don't actually remember exactly how my last company got started.  I did this one with a partner who handled the business side of things, but was also a really good designer and front-end developer, so we made a kick-ass team.  The product was motivated by the observation that people used Microsoft Excel for purposes that it was never really intended to serve.  In particular, people tended to use it as a replacement for a SQL database.  The idea was to build a product with a spreadsheet-like UI, but with a SQL database on the back end.  We had three launch customers lined up, all of whom seemed to be very excited about the idea.  While we were building the MVP we had a previously scheduled meeting with a VC acquaintance.  We told him what we were working on, not really intending it to be a pitch, but just FYI.  In one of those legendary Silicon-Valley moments he got so excited about the idea that he asked us to let him invest just to get a foot in the door.  We didn't really want to take any money until after we launched, but he insisted, so we capitulated.To make a long story short, we launched, and all three of our launch customers suddenly lost interest and didn't tell us why.  It was a similar situation that I had encountered previously with the banks.  No feedback, just suddenly not interested and not returning our calls.  At that point my partner had to quit because he needed a paycheck.  In a final desperate hail-mary I tried to pivot the company to something I could do on my own, but that didn't work either (obviously).  I'll spare you the details on that one.And that's it.  My tale of six and a half failed startups plus one failed academic career, all of which somehow added up to a good life at the end of the day.  Of course, hitting the jackpot with Google didn't hurt, but I really don't think that was the whole story.  I learned a lot.  I grew a lot.  And  I think my current happiness stems mainly from the fact that I like the person I've become, someone who can fail again and again and again and again and still find a way, for the most part, to be happy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Master the Art of the Product Manager

Hughes returns to the British Museum to get a special look at items from their upcoming touring exhibition Ancient Sudan: enduring heritage, an exploration into the Kushite Kingdom, a long lost civilisation that flourished in Sudan nearly 3,000 years ago.

For over 1,200 years from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD, the Kingdom of Kush flourished and at its height was one of the largest empires in the ancient world, ruling from the Blue Nile to the Levant.

Item 1: 00:56
Item 2: 05:44
Item 3: 12:28
Item 4: 17:56
Item 5: 24:10

This upcoming exhibition will examine this ancient culture's skilled craftsmanship, distinct religious beliefs, and the important role of women, as well as exploring the rich culture of modern Sudan. Highlights include beautiful examples of ceramics, a carved stone offering table and a striking bronze depiction of a goddess. 

Ancient Sudan: enduring heritage will be on display at Portsmouth Museum and Art Gallery (1 February – 11 May 2025), and Stirling Smith Art Gallery & Museum (9 August – 9 November 2025). Find out more here: www.britishmuseum.org/ancientsudan

The long-term effects of premature births are often be underestimated.

Born three months prematurely and weighing just 800 grams, Amina’s start in life could hardly have been more dramatic. She is now in the intensive care unit of a German clinic. Her mother is with her as often as possible. Thanks to modern medicine, extremely premature babies like Amina have a chance of survival. But the long-term consequences are often underestimated. There are around 13 million premature births worldwide every year. Parents are calling for more information about the late effects of premature birth and hope for a growing understanding for those affected. #DWstories

For God to be God, God must be infallible and know the future perfectly, including all my actions from birth to death. For my will to be free, my actions must not be constrained. But if God knows the future—if God literally knows now what I am going to do later – then how are my actions later not constrained? How then free will?

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67892eb0c2824244c27b929f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=3pCPGiAXWzux-J-3YCe1OwbmIbvcy6B9C-AaxFO1HJk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the LA Wildfires Started ️‍🔥</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v328qNRMYcc</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/v328qNRMYcc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 23:56:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

And the trend is rising. The German harvest can‘t meet this demand and that’s why many berries are imported. From places where their cultivation is bad news for both people and for nature itself.

Southern Portugal is a booming region for berry production in Europe. The country’s cultivation zone has increased fivefold in recent years - to almost 5,000 hectares. One of the producers: Logofruits. The Portuguese company grows blueberries on its plantation in Odemira on 75 hectares of land. For the owner, Lourenço de Botton, the biggest challenge is finding enough workers for the harvest season. Blueberries have to be picked by hand, a labor-intensive process that requires Logofruits to employ around 600 workers per day. Many of those toiling in the orchards in the Alentejo region come from Nepal, India or Bangladesh.

Odemira’s mayor Hélder Guerreiro explains that almost 11,000 migrant workers from over 80 countries now live here. This corresponds to around 40 per cent of the municipality's population. Although on the one hand it’s a great opportunity for the region, which has struggled with emigration in the past, it also presents a huge social challenge. Another problem, according to Guerreiro, is intensive farming’s huge demand for water.

One thing’s for sure: a growing appetite for berries in Germany has consequences for the countries where they are grown. Blueberries and raspberries also grow in Germany, but not all year round. In summer, supermarkets should be full of regional fruit. But they’re not. Even during the domestic season, more and more produce from abroad can be found on the fresh produce shelves. What does this mean for German berry producers?

Erik Appel from Darmstadt grows raspberries, among other things. However, berries cultivated in Germany are completely different to those that have been shipped over long distances. These varieties have been bred to be particularly robust and long-lasting. When it comes to raspberries from the region for the local market, flavor is paramount. And in that respect, says Erik Appel, nothing beats local berries. In terms of labor costs however, it’s almost impossible to compete with imported goods. After all, Germany has one of the highest minimum wages in Europe. This is reflected in the price - imported goods are often cheaper than regional berries.

But now it can do it even better, explains Marco Ippolito of the Node.js steering committee:

In August 2024 Node.js introduced a new experimental feature, Type Stripping, aimed at addressing a longstanding challenge in the Node.js ecosystem: running TypeScript with no configuration. Enabled by default in Node.js v23.6.0, this feature is on its way to becoming stable. 


TypeScript has reached incredible levels of popularity and has been the most requested feature in all the latest Node.js surveys. Unlike other alternatives such as CoffeeScript or Flow, which never gained similar traction, TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern development. While it has been supported in Node.js for some time through loaders, they relied heavily on configuration and user libraries. This reliance led to inconsistencies between different loaders, making them difficult to use interchangeably. The developer experience suffered due to these inconsistencies and the extra setup required... The goal is to make development faster and simpler, eliminating the overhead of configuration while maintaining the flexibility that developers expect... 

TypeScript is not just a language, it also relies on a toolchain to implement its features. The primary tool for this purpose is tsc, the TypeScript compiler CLI... Type checking is tightly coupled to the implementation of tsc, as there is no formal specification for how the language's type system should behave. This lack of a specification means that the behavior of tsc is effectively the definition of TypeScript's type system. tsc does not follow semantic versioning, so even minor updates can introduce changes to type checking that may break existing code. Transpilation, on the other hand, is a more stable process. It involves converting TypeScript code into JavaScript by removing types, transforming certain syntax constructs, and optionally "downleveling" the JavaScript to allow modern syntax to execute on older JavaScript engines. Unlike type checking, transpilation is less likely to change in breaking ways across versions of tsc. The likelihood of breaking changes is further reduced when we only consider the minimum transpilation needed to make the TypeScript code executable — and exclude downleveling of new JavaScript features not yet available in the JavaScript engine but available in TypeScript... 

Node.js, before enabling it by default, introduced --experimental-strip-types. This mode allows running TypeScript files by simply stripping inline types without performing type checking or any other code transformation. This minimal technique is known as Type Stripping. By excluding type checking and traditional transpilation, the more unstable aspects of TypeScript, Node.js reduces the risk of instability and mostly sidesteps the need to track minor TypeScript updates. Moreover, this solution does not require any configuration in order to execute code... Node.js eliminates the need for source maps by replacing the removed syntax with blank spaces, ensuring that the original locations of the code and structure remain intact. It is transparent — the code that runs is the code the author wrote, minus the types... 

"As this experimental feature evolves, the Node.js team will continue collaborating with the TypeScript team and the community to refine its behavior and reduce friction. You can check the roadmap for practical next steps..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John Dupré - Philosophy of Biological Ethics &amp; New Norms</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxoRQryScXE</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zxoRQryScXE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shop the Closer To Truth merch store with items like T-shirts, hoodies, mugs, notebooks, and more: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje

The world of medicine and our understanding of the human body is always in flux. New discoveries are made every day, and before too long, you learn that the cigarette you were smoking to cure your upset stomach was actually loading you up with cancer.

ABSTRACT
Programming #GenerativeArt, also known as #CreativeCoding, is often a trial-and-error process, combining creativity and logic to present something aesthetic. However, creative coding has a high barrier to entry due to the breadth of knowledge and coding skills required. This talk aims to lower that barrier for you to take home and practice creative coding.

In this talk, you will learn about #algorithms and techniques for generative art using a pure #FunctionalParadigm. First, shepherding random numbers to simulate the universality of nature patterns that appear in plants, rocks, sand, and smoke. Next, using L-system formal grammar to create a seemingly infinite, but well-structured, series of graphics. Lastly, interfacing with printers to bring your drawing to life.

For you to get the most out of this talk, you should be comfortable working in a functional language of your choice. Although I will introduce some theory, background in mathematics and formal theory is not required to attend.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

By gradually occupying positions of power in politics, the judiciary and the media and steadily expanding its sphere of influence. Adherents have been bolstered by Trump’s 2024 election victory.

The tightening of abortion laws, the 2021 storming of the Capitol, a flare-up in racist violence: The US far-right has never been more powerful and visible than it is today - and that’s not just due to Donald Trump. The ultra-right has managed to gain a foothold at the very heart of US politics. As part of a strategy to win the 2024 election, it was ready to create a social divide similar to that of the secessionist wars, plunge the country into chaos and cause democracy to totter.
The triumph of the radical right is the outcome of a well-thought-out strategy set in motion more than 40 years ago by a conservative minority thirsty for power. And this group has pushed through its agenda under the nose of the world. Today, we can see how successful its strategy was: The ultra-right has gained control of the key centers of power, a process accelerated on all levels by Donald Trump. With his help, the ultra-right now has control of the Supreme Court. Its advance continues unabated, with Trump’s election victory marking an interim high point.

ABSTRACT
Functional programming is a useful technique. We spend a lot of time discussing it in the context of hard, challenging or interesting problems, but no where nearly enough in the context of mundane problems.

The UNIX shell, or command line interpreter. A simple, but useful program too often mistaken as complex, or mysterious. Almost every programmer is exposed to shells from a users perspective, but far fewer have ever implemented one, or even know where to start.

This talk aims to be a fun look at using functional programming in and around a traditional, some would say mundane, system utility. We will work through the concepts involved with implementing your own shell, and live code our way to a basic functional shell implemented in Haskell.

From this talk, attendees will walk a way with a better understanding of a program they use every day, as well as ideas and inspiration around using functional programming to solve mundane programming problems.

The findings appear in a pre-print paper titled "How is Google using AI for internal code migrations?" The Register reports: Their focus is on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas, such as Ads, Search, Workspace and YouTube, instead of generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services like code completion, code review, and question answering. Google's code migrations involved: changing 32-bit IDs in the 500-plus-million-line codebase for Google Ads to 64-bit IDs; converting its old JUnit3 testing library to JUnit4; and replacing the Joda time library with Java's standard java.time package. The int32 to int64 migration, the Googlers explain, was not trivial as the IDs were often generically defined (int32_t in C++ or Integer in Java) and were not easily searchable. They existed in tens of thousands of code locations across thousands of files. Changes had to be tracked across multiple teams and changes to class interfaces had to be considered across multiple files. "The full effort, if done manually, was expected to require hundreds of software engineering years and complex crossteam coordination," the authors explain.
 
For their LLM-based workflow, Google's software engineers implemented the following process. An engineer from Ads would identify an ID in need of migration using a combination of code search, Kythe, and custom scripts. Then an LLM-based migration toolkit, triggered by someone knowledgeable in the art, was run to generate verified changes containing code that passed unit tests. Those changes would be manually checked by the same engineer and potentially corrected. Thereafter, the code changes would be sent to multiple reviewers who are responsible for the portion of the codebase affected by the changes. The result was that 80 percent of the code modifications in the change lists (CLs) were purely the product of AI; the remainder were either human-authored or human-edited AI suggestions.
 
"We discovered that in most cases, the human needed to revert at least some changes the model made that were either incorrect or not necessary," the authors observe. "Given the complexity and sensitive nature of the modified code, effort has to be spent in carefully rolling out each change to users." Based on this, Google undertook further work on LLM-driven verification to reduce the need for detailed review. Even with the need to double-check the LLM's work, the authors estimate that the time required to complete the migration was reduced by 50 percent. With LLM assistance, it took just three months to migrate 5,359 files and modify 149,000 lines of code to complete the JUnit3-JUnit4 transition. Approximately 87 percent of the code generated by AI ended up being committed with no changes. As for the Joda-Java time framework switch, the authors estimate a time saving of 89 percent compared to the projected manual change time, though no specifics were provided to support that assertion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Other people&apos;s robots (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/76</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/76/changelog--friends-76.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod & Adam discuss Nvidia’s recently announced personal AI supercomputer, Waymo’s latest infinite loop, what’s involved in getting a “modern” terminal setup, and whether or not AI has gone mainstream… warts & all!Changelog++ members get a bonus 8 minutes at the end of this episode and zero ads.

Michael Imperioli's maternal grandfather, Alberto Luzzi, was born in New York City in June, 1914. Alberto had a difficult childhood due to the early passing of his father, Michael's great grandfather, who died in an accident cleaning trains for the transit system. Michael's great grandfather grew up in Calabria, Italy, before moving to America after getting married. 

Michael Imperioli is best known for his starring role as Christopher Moltisanti in the acclaimed iconic HBO TV series THE SOPRANOS, which earned him a Best Supporting Actor Emmy Award. He also wrote 5 episodes of the show and was co-screenwriter of the film SUMMER OF SAM, directed by Spike Lee. Imperioli has appeared in six of Lee’s films and has also acted in films by Martin Scorsese, Abel Ferrara, Walter Hill, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes Brothers. Michael was also seen in HBO's second season of Mike White’s critically acclaimed hit series THE WHITE LOTUS.

This film shows how this commitment became a pillar of society. What measures are needed today to defend humanist values and preserve democratic achievements?

The film provides an insight into the challenges and hopes of remembrance culture work and examines how the motto ‘never again’ is evolving into an educational policy obligation in Germany.

With the end of the Second World War, two words became an integral part of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany: ‘Never again’. Never again fascism, never again war, never again a dictatorship like National Socialism, in which minorities are persecuted, disenfranchised and murdered. This endeavor gave rise to a culture of remembrance, which manifested itself in the form of education in schools, memorials and days of remembrance.

But sometimes, it seems like the more frequently these words appear in official speeches, the more they lose their clarity and meaning. The discourse on a meaningful culture of remembrance is mainly conducted in academia, and often doesn’t consider the realities of life in society at large.
 
The documentary is an incisive and confrontational look at practical remembrance work. It shows what measures need to be taken to protect democracy and human rights in Germany. It focuses on the everyday lives of those who put the culture of remembrance into practice, and those who benefit from it.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

ABSTRACT
Application and Infrastructure configuration is usually an easy place to make catastrophic mistakes. The new Pkl configuration language brings a safer and more maintainable approach to defining and managing configuration. It works with Kubernetes, Spring applications, and really anywhere that you have Yaml or other unstructured configuration.

This talk will introduce Pkl and teach you how to use it in your Java applications and infrastructure. If you've written Yaml or used other configuration approaches, this talk will help you understand how Pkl can provide a better foundation for more safe and maintainable configuration. [...]

Since then, its politics have drifted rightward. Titans of industry and finance are migrating there, creating what’s being called Wall Street South. Now, as Donald Trump prepares for a second term, this nexus of "MAGA" and money could make Florida the policy blueprint for the rest of the nation.

Dark matter has eluded us for many decades. Even our most advanced particle colliders and sophisticated underground detectors have come up short. But it may be that we can finally solve this mystery with a much simpler experiment, involving a ray of light, a good clock, and the planet Mars.

First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.This raises the price of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription from $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "Classic" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "services & subscriptions" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Slashes Google&apos;s Code Migration Time By Half</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/16/1810253/ai-slashes-googles-code-migration-time-by-half?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:51:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google has cut code migration time in half by deploying AI tools to assist with large-scale software updates, according to a new research paper from the company's engineers.

But this film documents a bleak scenario -- in which microcredits have destroyed entire families. Over-indebtedness has driven some recipients to suicide.

Expectations were high. When Muhammad Yunus, the "banker to the poor” and founder of the Grameen Bank for microfinance in Bangladesh, received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2006, it was clear to many that the principle of helping people to help themselves would lift many out of poverty. 

From the 1980s to the early 2000s, microcredits were seen as one of the best tools for combating poverty. However, the loans, which were initially seen as a positive inflow of liquidity, quickly led to further financial obligations for many families. After all, interest had to be paid on these loans. Illegal lenders stepped in. The pressure on families became unbearable, leading to the sale of land, migration, the break-up of families and ultimately even suicide.

The film tells the stories of three Cambodian families. Along the way, it debunks the myth of microfinance as a tool that truly helps the poor. Told through the eyes of the protagonists and through their personal experiences, this film highlights the hardships faced by so many Cambodians because of debt.

These baths were more than places for hygiene — they were essential to Roman social life. Citizens would visit the baths after their morning business, using the time not only to clean but to socialize, network, and even conduct business. The grandeur of the baths is exemplified by their mosaics, shrines, and gyms, which catered to all aspects of Roman daily life.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

The video shows journalists and innocent Iraqi civilians, including Sajad’s father as he stopped to help, being circled and then repeatedly shot at from the American helicopter.  

The classified footage, allegedly showing potential war crimes, was made public in 2010 by publisher Julian Assange, for which he was facing a 175-year prison sentence in the US.  

In June 2024, Assange pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information under a deal allowing him to walk free after a 14-year legal battle.

"We don't care about professional coders anymore," CEO Amjad Masad told Semafor, as the company refocuses on helping non-developers build software using AI. 

The strategic shift follows the September launch of Replit's "Agent" tool, which can create working applications from simple text commands. The tool, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, has driven a five-fold revenue increase in six months. The move marks a significant departure for Replit, which built its business providing online coding tools for software developers. The company is now betting that AI will make traditional programming skills less crucial, allowing non-technical users to create software through natural language instructions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft patches Windows to eliminate Secure Boot bypass threat</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-patches-windows-to-eliminate-secure-boot-bypass-threat/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/exploit-vulnerability-security-1.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:24:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past seven months—and likely longer—an industry-wide standard that protects Windows devices from firmware infections could be bypassed using a simple technique. On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unbundling the Enterprise • Stephen Fishman, Matt McLarty &amp; Erik Wilde • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdZ1U9zvU90</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rdZ1U9zvU90?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

DESCRIPTION
How can businesses thrive by embracing optionality through digital transformation?
Authors Matt McLarty and Stephen Fishman talk about their book “Unbundling the Enterprise” with Erik Wilde. They highlight the power of APIs and flexible systems in enabling companies to capitalize on unforeseen opportunities, or "happy accidents," and how low-cost experimentation can drive long-term success.

The conversation emphasizes that optionality is crucial not only in tech but also in business strategy, urging organizations to view their digital capabilities as part of a broader platform that supports both developer empowerment and revenue growth. With insights on optimization, platform engineering, and the importance of aligning technology with business objectives, the authors offer a roadmap for companies to navigate the future with agility and resilience.

It wasn’t a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don’t need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I’ll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier—and hopefully, they’ll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here’s what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.This post is for paid subscribers.

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

Are we all living in The Matrix? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with actor Laurence Fishburne to explore the science of The Matrix, simulation theory, and who has the better deep voice. Would you take the red pill? 

Would you rather have truth or normalcy? We explore the choice Morpheus presents Neo and how it pertains to science. Laurence shares the experience of bringing Morpheus to life. He and Neil unpack the film’s profound symbolism as well as discuss the blending of ancient mythology with the emerging digital age.

We analyze the plausibility of the movie’s central premise. Can humans really serve as batteries for machines? We explore simulation theory, pondering whether our universe could be one of many nested simulations, as posed by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom. From the optical science behind the iconic spoon-bending scene to the film’s intricate religion and philosophy, we explore the storytelling elements that make The Matrix timeless.

Neil connects its themes to questions about reality, truth, and human potential. Plus, a few surprises—including the “deep voice-off” and musings on why gods always have baritone voices—make this episode a must-listen for movie buffs and science enthusiasts alike.

ABSTRACT
How can you work effectively with AI as your colleague?

Since March 2023 (the release of GPT4) I've worked almost fulltime with AI-powered software development. Both as a productivity tool, to get work done faster and better, and also as way of building new types of products and features that were previously impossible. In fact, GenAI has completely changed the way I work and the way I look at software development. It feels like I've gained superpowers, but I've had to unlearn and change habits that I've built up over 30 years.

Coding with AI is a very different way of working. And like any other skill, you kind of suck at it at first but improve with practice. The transition to this strange new world can be jarring, but it is unavoidable. Being a developer in 2024 and not coding with AI is the equivalent of being 2022 and manually writing machine code or manually creating punched cards.

In this talk I'll share practical experiences from AI-powered software development - tips, tricks, and pitfalls - using mostly live demos. These techniques will reduce your time from Idea to Working Code, which is a nice feeling 🙂 [...]

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections. Hence, knowing SSH client control commands can save you time and boost your productivity when such gotchas occur. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parallels Can Now Run x86 Windows and Linux On Apple Silicon Mac</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/15/0216248/parallels-can-now-run-x86-windows-and-linux-on-apple-silicon-mac?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop now supports running 64-bit x86 operating systems on Apple Silicon Macs through its proprietary emulation engine, enabling users to run traditional Windows and Linux distributions. However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Owns Greenland?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/who-owns-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/678573f83f68018e6a0c098d/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=aK2ez0HAnyG6saKrZTvRIj4SynUteRmJb9DZo3TAn-U" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NuPhy Air60HE keyboard review (Gateron Low-profile Magnetic Jade Pro)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGI03Vdsj5s</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tGI03Vdsj5s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:31:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 7:40 for a typing demonstration.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WqljXZGTfug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

These screens occupy the dimensions of your terminal by default. While you can have many different screens in a single application, only one screen may be active at a time.When you create your  class, Textual will create a screen object implicitly. Yes, Textual requires you to have at least one screen or your application won’t work. If you do not create a new screen or switch to a different one, the default screen is where your widgets will get mounted or composed to.Screens are a great way to organize your application. Many applications have settings pages, help pages, and more. These are just a few examples of how you can use screens.Now that you know what a screen is, you’re ready to learn how to create new ones!When you create an application, you create a  implicitly. But how do you create your own ? Fortunately, Textual has made that easy. All you need to do is import the  class from  and extend it as needed.You can style screens the same way you do other widgets, except for the dimensions as screens are always the same size as your terminal window.To see how this all works, you will create an application with two screens:You second screen, which will be greenYou will be able to switch between the screens using a button. Each screen has its own button and its own event or message handler.Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called  with the following contents:# two_screens.py

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button

class GreenScreen(Screen):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Button("Main Screen", id="main")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#main")
    def on_main(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()


class MainAop(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("Switch", id="switch")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#switch")
    def on_switch(self) -> None:
        self.push_screen(GreenScreen())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()You use Textual’s handy  decorator to match against the button’s . That keeps the message from bubbling around to other event handlers, which is what could happen if you had used , for example.When you run your application, you will see something like this:Try clicking the buttons and switching between the screens.Of course, you don’t need to use button’s at all, if you don’t want to. You could use keyboard shortcuts instead. Why not give that a try?Go back to your Python IDE and create a new file called  with this code in it:# two_screens_keys_only.py

This film asks the question, How do Native Hawaiians in the diaspora keep the feeling of Aloha in their hearts, even when they live thousands of miles away? Dear Aloha follows two Native Hawaiians living in the Pacific Northwest as they reflect on how “Aloha” sustains them amidst distance, loss, and longing. Meanwhile, back in Hawai’i, local residents grapple with the legacy of colonization that has resulted in many Hawaiians being displaced from their homeland.

'HOMEGROWN: A Part Of/Apart From' is a collection of short films from the U.S. territories and Hawaiʻi exploring issues of cultural identity, sovereignty, and agency, as residents and members of the diaspora grapple with what it means to be “a part of and apart from” the mainland U.S.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness— leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

Donald Trump has promised to conduct “the largest deportation effort in American history,” no matter what it costs—but the price tag may be bigger than expected.

In today's video we look at a history of US border control and the economic costs of deporting more than six percent of the US workforce while the US workforce ages.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How To Lead Through Transformation in Tech • Hannah Foxwell &amp; Charles Humble • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La-oAqRr6cM</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/La-oAqRr6cM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOunscripted

DESCRIPTION
Charles Humble and Hannah Foxwell explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies, modern work practices, and management dynamics.

They emphasize the importance of methodologies like pair programming, flexible work designs, and inclusive team environments, especially for accommodating neurodiverse and introverted individuals.
Foxwell introduces the “three-teams model” to guide new managers in aligning with direct reports, leadership peers, and cross-functional collaborators. She underscores the significance of equitable leadership through mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship, particularly for underrepresented groups.

Exploring  AI’s potential, Foxwell highlights its transformative impact on software development and enterprise processes while cautioning against rushed adoption. She advocates for thoughtful experimentation and user-centric design, noting the need for cultural and structural shifts to fully realize AI’s benefits. Ultimately, the conversation centers on intentionality, empathy, and the need for organizations to balance innovation with human-centric practices. [...]

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding.

To qualify, developers must have a 2024 commit in Torvalds' kernel git tree and email him with the subject "I WANT A GUITAR PEDAL". He'll pick a winner at random, use his own money to buy a pedal kit from a company called Aion FX, and then 'build it with my own shaky little fingers, and send it to the victim by US postal services.'" The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."
 
"I will test the result to the best of my abilities, and the end result may actually work ... but you should set your expectations along the lines of "quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How William the Conqueror Rewrote History | Lucy Worsley Investigates</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k769WvKFP0</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1k769WvKFP0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/4gY7q1J | #LucyWorsleyPBS

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US splits world into three tiers for AI chip access</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/us_digital_flag_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the US government announced a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those manufactured by Nvidia, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FTC Chair Lina Khan’s Exit Interview: Challenging AI, Big Tech and More | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHn9R_T2R8</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/enHn9R_T2R8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan sat down with WSJ’s Damian Paletta on the final days of her post as FTC chair to reflect on a historically aggressive tenure at the head of the FTC – and what the future could look like for antitrust enforcement.

Legal Skirmish Continues</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0323229/oracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Oracle has informed us they won't voluntarily withdraw their trademark on 'JavaScript'." That's the word coming from the company behind Deno, the alternative JavaScript/TypeScript/WebAssembly runtime, which is pursuing a formal cancellation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

So what happens next? Oracle "will file their Answer, and we'll start discovery to show how 'JavaScript' is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle." Deno's social media posts show a schedule of various court dates that extend through July of 2026, so "The dispute between Oracle and Deno Land could go on for quite a while," reports InfoWorld:
Deno Land co-founder Ryan Dahl, creator of both the Deno and Node.js runtimes, said a formal answer from Oracle is expected before February 3, unless Oracle extends the deadline again. "After that, we will begin the process of discovery, which is where the real legal work begins. It will be interesting to see how Oracle argues against our claims — genericide, fraud on the USPTO, and non-use of the mark." 

The legal process begins with a discovery conference by March 5, with discovery closing by September 1, followed by pretrial disclosure from October 16 to December 15. An optional request for an oral hearing is due by July 8, 2026. 

Oracle took ownership of JavaScript's trademark in 2009 when it purchased Sun Microsystems, InfoWorld notes. 

But "Oracle does not control (and has never controlled) any aspect of the specification or how the phrase 'JavaScript' can be used by others," argues an official petition filed by Deno Land Inc. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
Today, millions of companies, universities, academics, and programmers, including Petitioner, use "JavaScript" daily without any involvement with Oracle. The phrase "JavaScript" does not belong to one corporation. It belongs to the public. JavaScript is the generic name for one of the bedrock languages of modern programming, and, therefore, the Registered Mark must be canceled. 

An open letter to Oracle discussing the genericness of the phrase "JavaScript," published at https://javascript.tm/, was signed by 14,000+ individuals at the time of this Petition to Cancel, including notable figures such as Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and the current editors of the JavaScript specification, Michael Ficarra and Shu-yu Guo. There is broad industry and public consensus that the term "JavaScript" is generic. 

The seven-page petition goes into great detail, reports InfoWorld. "Deno Land also accused Oracle of committing fraud in its trademark renewal efforts in 2019 by submitting screen captures of the website of JavaScript runtime Node.js, even though Node.js was not affiliated with Oracle."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Why Did I Survive?’: Altadena Residents Return Home Amid L.A.

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players — including Intel and AMD — in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roald Amundsen</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roald-amundsen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6765bf1e575cbdaa9d89bede/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=9jVYK1UV2_PMoWc2X_u4mlskXFK1CvhoaIrf4qRmQGI" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:05:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Lives Matter Rally (Dear Kelly Scene)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc5-B5AFpk</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zmc5-B5AFpk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 20:10:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DEAR KELLY will premiere in three days at 5:55 P.M.

Here's the thing. It's all hand-written using vi, even to this day. 

Is there any benefit to migrating this codebase to a more modern PHP framework, like Laravel? And is there an easy and minimally intrusive way this can be done en-masse, across dozens of applications and websites? 

Or at this point should I just stick with vi?

Neil deGrasse Tyson, joined by co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly, dives into the mysterious world of hypnosis with clinical psychiatrist David Spiegel. What is hypnosis? Is it about losing control—or gaining it?

We explore the human mind and consciousness, asking if there’s a “user manual” for our brains. How does hypnosis work? Dr. Spiegel explains how our salience network, which processes external stimuli, can be “turned down,” allowing us to engage deeply with our inner thoughts. Could this altered state offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?

Some are more hypnotizable than others—why? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic—targeted and potent, especially for managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well as for good? 

From recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis reveals its potential—and limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize medicine.

Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.On June 13, 1863, a letter published in The Press newspaper of Christchurch warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently popped up again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the . The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Main character syndrome?

Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.My immediate reaction was “oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn’t that
hard, you just need to….”, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
“you just need to…” list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a “modern” terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.what is a “modern terminal experience”?Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:multiline support for copy and paste: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediatly run them all! That’s scary! (, ): if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (): I can’t live without having my  and  in my prompt (): this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours () between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press  in vim to paste (, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too): for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete () (): I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor’s theme. (, )automatic terminal fixing: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn’t get messed up (): I want  to work ( or )being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like : ( and )There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.how I achieve a “modern experience”use the  shell. Mostly don’t configure it, except to:
set the  environment variable to my favourite terminal editoruse any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I’ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I’m not picky about this. I don’t really
configure it other than to choose a font.use , with a configuration that I’ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)A few things that affect my approach:I don’t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machinesI’d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everythingI work on a lot of small projects, not one big projectsome “out of the box” options for a “modern” experienceWhat if you want a nice experience, but don’t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminalmac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn’t have 256-colour support)cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghosttyshell config:
set the  environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editormaybe alias  to text editor: this is a tough one, maybe micro or helix? I haven’t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it’s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
( to copy,  to paste,  to select all) in micro and
they do what you’d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn’t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.Personally I  use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I’ve found in the past that they’re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app’s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.I don’t want to pretend that getting a “modern” terminal experience is easier
than it is though – I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let’s talk
about them!issue 1 with getting to a “modern” experience: the shellbash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:you need to customize your promptthey don’t come with git completions by default, you have to set them upby default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lotI find bash’s tab completion very frustrating, if there’s more than
one match then you can’t tab through themAnd even though I love fish, the fact
that it isn’t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.Of course it’s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn’t even need to be that complicated (in bash I’d
probably start with something like export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ', or maybe use starship).
But each of these “not complicated” things really does add up and it’s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.An extremely popular solution to getting a “modern” shell experience is
oh-my-zsh. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I’ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past – it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what’s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it’s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.issue 2 with getting to a “modern” experience: the text editorIn the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were , , and .I think the main options for terminal text editors are:use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the workuse nano and accept that you’re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don’t think you can select text with the mouse and then “cut”
it in nano)use  or  which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editorjust avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode’s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use  as their  in the terminal.issue 3: individual applicationsThe last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine,  doesn’t support
the  keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:realize why this is happening (Mac OS won’t ship GNU tools, and “Ctrl-Left arrow” support comes from GNU readline)find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)adjust my environment (put Homebrew’s sqlite3 in my PATH)I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn’t feel “worth it” – often I’ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don’t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I’ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.A big part of having a “modern” experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can’t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in , but in   I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more “modern” command line tools isn’t easy (though
I made a list here),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you’re
SSHed into another machine, they won’t always be there.everything affects everything elseSomething I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything “nice”
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don’t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I’d need to think about a few things, like:if I wanted tmux’s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I’d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has OSC 52 supportif I wanted to use iTerm’s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I’d need to change how I configure colours – right now I set them
with a shell script that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.and probably more things I haven’t thought of. “Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours” sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided “well, I don’t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I’m not using that feature!”.It’s also hard to remember which features I’m relying on – for example maybe
my current terminal  have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don’t even realize that that’s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.Personally even though I think my setup is not  complicated, it’s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I’ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there’s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using  to eza a year or two ago and
while I like it (because  prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I’m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it’s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I’m
very happy I did.getting a “modern” terminal is not that easyTrying to explain how “easy” it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it’s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.I’ve found that there’s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Keychron Q0 Max macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPk09Ars-JE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xPk09Ars-JE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-max-qmk-custom-number-pad

PowerSchool says its cloud-based student information system is used by 18,000 customers around the globe, including the US and Canada, to handle grading, attendance records, and personal information of more than 60 million K-12 students and teachers. On December 28 someone managed to get into its systems and access their contents "using a compromised credential," the California-based biz told its clients in an email seen by Register this week.
 
[...] "We believe the unauthorized actor extracted two tables within the student information system database," a spokesperson told us. "These tables primarily include contact information with data elements such as name and address information for families and educators. "For a certain subset of the customers, these tables may also include Social Security Number, other personally identifiable information, and limited medical and grade information. "Not all PowerSchool student information system customers were impacted, and we anticipate that only a subset of impacted customers will have notification obligations." While the company has tightened security measures and offered identity protection services to affected individuals, cybersecurity firm Cyble suggests the intrusion "may have been more serious and gone on much longer than has been publicly acknowledged so far," reports The Register. The cybersecurity vendor says the intrusion could have occurred as far back as June 16, 2011, with it ending on January 2 of this year.
 
"Critical systems and applications such as Oracle Netsuite ERP, HR software UltiPro, Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitLab, and sensitive credentials for platforms like Microsoft login, LogMeIn, Windows AD Azure, and BeyondTrust" may have been compromised, too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It&apos;s a peccadillo circus (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/75</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/75/changelog--friends-75.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mat Ryer is back!

Trump says the U.S. needs the island for “national security purposes,” but Greenland has been tied both politically and culturally with Denmark for decades. The Arctic island has vast deposits in rare earths, oil and gas, also making it a focal point for other rivals including China and Russia. But can Trump actually purchase the territory from Denmark?

RFK, Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. 

The US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. 

Fluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains — and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.

The move is part of a raft of promises Trump made to the cryptocurrency community while on the campaign trail. These included the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a promise to immediately fire Gary Gensler, the then chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump’s return to the White House coincides with a massive rally in cryptocurrencies. In December, Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time -- a significant milestone after 16 years of boom and bust. But for the average American, crypto still comes with plenty of risks.

Though there are more fixed and mobile telephone connections, even they use Internet technology in their core. For all the many uses the Internet allows for today, its origins lie in the cold war and the need for a defense communications network that could survive a nuclear strike. But that defense communications network quickly became used for general communications and within only a few years of the first transmission, traffic on the predecessor to today’s Internet was already 75 percent email.Arpanet was the vital precursor of today’s Internet, commissioned by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1969. In his interesting account of why Arpanet came about, Stephen Lukasic, director of DARPA from 1970–75, wrote that if its true nature and impact had been realized it would never have been permitted under the US government structure of the time. The concept for a decentralized communications technology that would survive a nuclear attack would have placed it outside DARPA’s remit (as defense communications specifically were assigned to a different agency), so the focus changed to how to connect computers together so that major applications could be run on the most appropriate system available.This was in the era of time-sharing computers. Today’s familiar world of the ubiquitous “personal computer” on each desk was decades away. Computers of this time were generally very large, filling entire rooms, and comparatively rare. Users working at connected terminals would submit jobs to the computer that would allocate processing time for the job when available. The idea went that if these computers were networked together, an available remote computer could process a job even when the computers closer to the users were full. The resulting network was called Arpanet, and the first packets of data traversed the network in September 1969.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Islam Influenced Black Americans in 1920s Chicago | American Muslims: A History Revealed</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN8bg2UiiVg</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vN8bg2UiiVg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2025 17:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 1920s saw a revival in Islam among Black Americans fleeing poverty and persecution in the Jim Crow South. In Northern cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, they found strength and security in a range of Muslim organizations, from the India-based Ahmadiyya movement to the homegrown Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam. In this film, host Malika Bilal (Senior Presenter, Al Jazeera English) tells the story of these early Black American Muslim communities through a woman named Florence Watts, who moved to the bustling South Side of Chicago around 1910, where she found work as a cook and a maid. 

Drawing on the work of Sylvia Chan-Malik, (author of Being Muslim: A Cultural History of Women of Color in American Islam,) Malika discovers how Florence was drawn to the teachings of the Ahmadiyya missionary, Mufti Mohammad Sadiq. In 1923, she joined one of the first multi-racial Muslim communities in the country. That same year, Florence was featured in the Ahmadiyya magazine Moslem Sunrise, her image captured in one of the earliest known photographs of a group of Muslim women taken in the United States. Through Florence’s story, Malika discovers how these Muslim groups helped working-class Black Americans resist the confines of race in the United States and feel part of a global community of believers. They in turn helped to create a legacy of Islam that has been embraced by African Americans since.

--

No substance has been as constant an ally to insidious scheming as arsenic, the so-called “king of poisons.” In its chemically pure form, it isn’t much of a threat because our bodies don’t absorb it well; it’s when arsenic combines with other elements that things get dangerous. So, how did this substance become such a popular poison? Neil Bradbury digs into the element's sordid and lethal history.

Overall, I was satisfied with it, despite some strange recent updates like adding AI features, KeyChain integration, and security vulnerabilities.In recent years, new terminal emulators have appeared. I tried using them mainly for testing macmon. A couple of years ago, I tried switching to kitty, which was faster due to GPU acceleration. However, it required too much customization and still looked very non-native for macOS. GPU acceleration was added to iTerm as well, so I stayed with it.I also tried Alacritty, but it is very basic and lacks the features I need. Recently, I tested Ghostty, which has gained huge attention – it has nice defaults, but its RAM usage is concerning (around 250MB per empty tab). Currently, it also lacks buffer search, which makes the terminal useless for me.I heard a lot of positive feedback about WezTerm from bobuk. So I decided to try it out and use it for some time – and I am very satisfied with it.The next part of the article will be about how to make WezTerm understandable for iTerm users to try it or switch completely.WezTerm can be installed from Homebrew:When you first open WezTerm, it looks plain, non-native, and not very functional. But actually, it has everything you need. This is because WezTerm is cross-platform, unlike iTerm2, so the author left minimal default settings, leaving the rest of the configuration to the user. My goal is to achieve a similar experience in WezTerm as I had in iTerm.WezTerm does not have a graphical interface for configuration, and the setup is done through a Lua file (this is unusual for me, but Vim users are familiar with it). The configuration file can be located at  or ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua. I prefer the second path because it is where Fish and starship store configs too.Create a configuration file:And then add the boilerplate code for configuration:First, I want to change the default font, its size, and disable ligatures (because it's important to see the actual characters in case of some logs).Save the file, and the changes should be applied immediately (yes, no reload required!).Next, I want to change the theme and set it to follow the current system theme automatically. For the past year, I have been using Catppuccin themes, and I am very happy with them. They rarely have issues where some text colors blend with the background. To make the theme switch automatically based on the current system theme, we need to write a small Lua function (I copied it from the documentation):I forgot to mention that the Catppuccin theme, like many other popular themes, is pre-installed in WezTerm, so you don't need to install it separately like in iTerm, which is very cool. Of course, you can also set up your own colors.The default padding also seems a bit large, so let's make it smaller. I also had a Blinking Line Cursor (I don't remember if this is the default or not in iTerm). Let's set both configurations:In iTerm, I used the Minimal theme to save vertical space for tabs. We can do the same in WezTerm (the default tabs don't look very good). Also possible to add some transparency and blur to the window. I didn't use this in iTerm, but let's try it now:In iTerm, I usually set large values for Cols/Rows to make the start window bigger. This approach is a bit outdated, so let's make the window open in full screen when the terminal starts.Finally, the most important part is setting up hotkeys – it's hard to give up what you've been used to for years. An important thing for me is Split Panels with  / .  should close the current active panel, not the whole tab.  – clear the current screen.  /  for start/end of the line. I think these are all defaults from iTerm, so let's make them the same in WezTerm:WezTerm also has a Command Execution menu. I haven't used it much yet, but just in case, I bind it to the same keys as in VSCode / Zed – .Note: In the configuration, the  value is case-sensitive, so  and  are different things (basically  is the same as ). I initially got confused with this.Overall, I am very satisfied with WezTerm and have fully switched to using it daily. One cool feature I want to mention is the quick connect to servers in Known hosts via SSH (Command Palette → type server name → Enter OR Nav Bar → Shell → Click on server name). WezTerm also has Workspaces – an alternative to tmux, but I haven't used it actively yet.Here a gist with the final config from this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here’s how hucksters are manipulating Google to promote shady Chrome extensions</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/googles-chrome-web-store-has-a-serious-spam-problem-promoting-shady-extensions/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chrome-web-store-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 23:46:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The people overseeing the security of Google’s Chrome browser explicitly forbid third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the Chrome Web Store. The policy specifically calls out search-manipulating techniques such as listing multiple extensions that provide the same experience or plastering extension descriptions with loosely related or unrelated keywords.On Wednesday, security and privacy researcher Wladimir Palant revealed that developers are flagrantly violating those terms in hundreds of extensions currently available for download from Google. As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.Not looking? Don’t care?

What sets ancient Rome apart is that many of these celebrities—particularly gladiators, actors, and musicians—were slaves, performing in public arenas to gain fame, sometimes even achieving wealth and freedom.

Explore how Roman emperors, such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, shaped not only the political landscape but also fashion trends and cultural movements. Hadrian, for instance, popularized wearing a beard, which became fashionable for a century after his reign. Roman gladiators, actresses, musicians, and authors, rose to prominence through their performances. Despite being from marginalized backgrounds, their talents made them stars, adored by the public.

For years, the auto industry has been hyping the transition to electric vehicles with optimistic sales forecasts for electric models and huge growth projections. Investors pumped up valuations for automakers, based on their visions for an electric future.

Now the hype is dwindling, and companies are again cheering consumer choice. Automakers from Ford Motor and General Motors to Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo are scaling back or delaying their electric vehicle plans.

Tesla’s annual vehicle deliveries declined for the first time in more than a decade during a period when overall car sales are up. Have automakers overinvested in EVs and are EVs killing the car industry?

She was every bit a woman of her time, engaging in the overblown sentimentality and culture of death so pervasive during the age that bears her name. When she died at 81, the queen left secret, detailed instructions on how to handle her body and what items to place in her coffin. There are, indeed, a number of strange Queen Victoria death facts worth exploring.

But this did not apply to the armed services until January 2000 – prior to that being queer in the British military was not only illegal but would have resulted in a possible jail term and instant dismissal. Lee Arnott has studied the gay experience within the military between 1969 and the present day. In this video, we look at why it took so long for the British military to lift the ban.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, there was a sports journalist named Maria.She had to travel often by flight for work.But one day she lost her luggage during a flight, and couldn’t track it. So she was sad and upset.She hears about a tracking device, called Apple AirTag, from a coworker.And bought it immediately, she was dazzled by its simplicity in tracking luggage.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re also on Bluesky:An AirTag contains a low-power CPU and a tiny amount of memory.A tracking device must send its accurate location data at regular intervals.Yet finding location data using GPS, WiFI, or cellular networks consumes power. Besides it’s expensive to maintain a tracking device with GPS functionality.So smart engineers at Apple used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.An AirTag doesn’t use GPS, WiFi, or a cellular network for communication; instead, it uses Bluetooth Low Energy ().Imagine BLE as a low-power wireless technology for communication.The key pair is shared between AirTag and the user account. The AirTag sends location data after encrypting it using the public key. While the user account decrypts the received location data using the private key.Think of the  as an email address; anyone can send messages to it. While the  is similar to the password of an inbox; only the user with the password can read emails.And authenticity of an email can be verified by checking the sender’s email address: .2. Broadcasting AirTag’s LocationThey send the AirTag’s location, which is near its owner’s iPhone, using Bluetooth, or Ultra Wideband for precision and efficiency.Think of  as a wireless technology for high-speed, and short-range communication.Yet Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband communication won’t work if the owner’s iPhone is far from the AirTag. So they rely on someone else's iPhone which is nearby.The AirTag broadcasts its public key every 2 seconds over BLE.Someone else’s iPhone, which is nearby, receives the broadcast signal. The iPhone encrypts its location data and timestamp using the received public key.The iPhone uploads the encrypted data to the Apple server over HTTP.Put simply, AirTag doesn’t send location data; instead, only the public key. The iPhone then includes its location data and encrypts it.3. Finding AirTag’s LocationThe owner can find AirTag’s location using their iPhone app.The owner authenticates on the Apple server.The owner requests location data for a specific public key.The owner decrypts the received location data using their private key.The iPhone then displays AirTag’s recent location on a map.An iPhone is necessary to relay location data, so an AirTag won’t work if there aren’t any iPhones nearby.Put simply, the precision and effectiveness of an AirTag depends on the number of iPhones in its proximity.While there are around 1.46 billion iPhone users in the world.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in February 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

Analysis of the coffee consumption of more than 40,000 adults found that morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease during a 10-year follow-up period than those who went without. But the benefits to heart health appeared to vanish in people who drank coffee throughout the day, the researchers found, with medical records showing no significant reduction in mortality for all-day drinkers compared with those who avoided coffee. [...]
 
The study suggests that a morning dose of coffee is better for the heart than an evening one, but it does not explain why. One possible explanation is that drinking coffee later in the day can disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin. This in turn affects sleep, inflammation and blood pressure, all of which can harm heart health. In an accompanying editorial, Prof Thomas Luscher, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals in London, notes that many all-day drinkers sleep poorly, adding that coffee seems to suppress melatonin, a hormone that is important for inducing sleep in the brain. The effects are driven largely by caffeine, but coffee contains hundreds of other bioactive compounds that affect our physiology. The researchers say some substances in the blood that drive inflammation often peak in the morning and could be countered by anti-inflammatory compounds in a morning coffee. "This explanation applies to both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee," they write. "Overall, we must accept the now substantial evidence that coffee drinking, particularly in the morning hours, is likely to be healthy," Luscher writes. "Thus, drink your coffee, but do so in the morning!"
 
The study has been published in the European Heart Journal.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Game Emulation on the Carbon Engine with Dimitris “MVG” Giannakis</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/08/game-emulation-on-the-carbon-engine-with-dimitris-mvg-giannakis/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=game-emulation-on-the-carbon-engine-with-dimitris-mvg-giannakis</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED8201398311.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 10:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Video game emulation is the process of using software to replicate the functionality of gaming hardware.

Our family made eight $1 million donations to nonprofit groups working to support those most currently in need:Team Rubicon – Mobilizing veterans to continue their service, leveraging their skills and experience to help Americans prepare, respond, and recover from natural disasters.Children's Hunger Fund – Provides resources to local churches in the United States and around the world to meet the needs of impoverished community members.PEN America – Defends writers against censorship and abuse, supports writers in need of emergency assistance, and amplifies the writing of incarcerated prisoners. (One of my personal favorites; I've seen the power of writing transform our world many times.)The Trevor Project – Working to change hearts, minds, and laws to support the lives of young adults seeking acceptance as fellow Americans.First Generation Investors –Introduces high school students in low-income areas to the fundamentals of investing, providing them real money to invest, encouraging long-term wealth accumulation and financial literacy among underserved youth.Global Refuge – Supporting migrants and refugees from around the globe, in partnership with community-based legal and social service providers nationwide, helping rebuild lives in America.Planned Parenthood – Provides essential healthcare services and resources that help individuals and families lead healthier lives.I encourage every American to contribute soon, however you can, to organizations you feel are those most currently in need here in America.We must alsowork toward deeper changes that will take decades to achieve. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth towards long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to the American Dream. I never thought my family would be able to do this. My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson.During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the federal minimum wage, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with lower in-state tuition, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. College tuition at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These huge cost increases for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen in 2008 when we built Stack Overflow, a Q&A website for programmers creating a shared Creative Commons knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that's the American way. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using ranked choice voting. We built a  – of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. It worked. With the guidance of my co-founder Joel Spolsky, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for Discourse, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to set boundaries the community agrees on, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. Digital democracy , for everyone.In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.I've always felt Stack Overflow and Discourse are projects for the public good that happen to be corporations. I probably couldn't have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck. That's what the American Dream promises us. I recently attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son's public high school. All I really knew was the famous "stay gold" line from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant:  the American Dream. In the printed program, the director wrote:This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity. Whether you've read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.Stay gold.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix captured this distortion so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, enough of us voted for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don't understand.I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively keeping America fair for everyone. Our status as the world's leading democracy is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as  so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because . We don't have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.Even with the wealth I have, I can't imagine what it would feel like to be a billionaireIt is, for lack of a better word, In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country's wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined.I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things that :Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile booksMore than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete. When would this wealth be transferred? November 5th raised the stakes. It is now time to allocate  I was so fortunate to be dealt within the next five years not just for my own family, but for all my fellow Americans. Our government seems to be slower and slower at delivering change due to the increased polarization of our two party system. The last meaningful constitutional amendment we've managed to pass in the last 60 years was the 26th amendment in 1971, lowering the voting age to 18 and giving more people a voice in our democracy. I've always loved the ideals behind the American Dream, though we continually struggle to live up to them. They are worth fighting for, even if it means making "good trouble". We must come together and believe in our shared American Dream so deeply that we can improve our democracy... but which dream?The American Dream contains the path of hate, and the path of love. Throughout our history, one hand is always fighting the other. Which path are we choosing?Our family pledges half our remaining wealth toward an American Dream founded on love.Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.We could found a new organization loosely based on the original RAND Corporation, but modernized like Lever for Change. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for  working within the current system or outside it.We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.We've already completed the eight $1 million donations listed above to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together. I will gladly advise and working towards the same goal.Please join us in Sharing the American Dream:Support organizations you feel are effectively helping those most in need across America right now.Within the next five years, also contribute public dedications of time or funds towards longer term efforts to keep the American Dream fair and attainable for all our children.(I could not have done this without the support of my partner Betsy Burton and the rest of my family. I'd also like to thank Steve McConnell, whose writing inspired me to start this blog in 2004. So many people from all walks of life generously shared their feedback to improve this post. We wrote it together.

In a post titled "Reflections" on his personal blog, Altman wrote, "We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it." He added, "We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies."Both statements are notable coming from Altman, who has served as the leader of OpenAI during the rise of mainstream generative AI products such as ChatGPT. AI agents are the latest marketing trend in AI, allowing AI models to take action on a user's behalf. However, critics of the company and Altman immediately took aim at the statements on social media."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rome&apos;s Greatest Humiliation: Roman Empire vs Germanic Tribes</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/romes-greatest-humiliation-roman-empire-vs-germanic-tribes</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6765bb18b49c6255e85c2f74/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=0bzBAh3y_ZuW8lHtXHWH0A8WM1Mpz4u_APs_RqNK5qA" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 5 Jan 2025 23:34:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 9 AD, the rebel chieftain Arminius and his confederation of Germanic tribes ambushed three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest. For days the Romans were relentlessly stalked through the woods and pounced on by their pursuers. All told, up to 20,000 Romans were killed in the chaos, and only a handful were able to escape. The battle proved to be one of Rome's most devastating defeats, and left a scar in the Roman psyche for generations to come.In this Explainer episode, Dan explores the historical context for the battle and its profound consequences for Roman strategy and expansion.

He makes the case for Northeastern to reconsider its decision to move from Racket to Python and Java later this year in an overhaul of its first-year curriculum. 

"Students will get extensive training in Python, which is currently the most requested language by co-op employers," Northeastern explains (some two decades after a Slashdot commenter made the same Hot Languages = Jobs observation in a spirited 2001 debate on Java as a CS introductory language)... 

"I have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a 'useful language' like Python," Kaplan writes. "But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket — it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends." Also expressing concerns about the selection of suitable languages for novice programming is King's College CS Prof Michael Kölling, who explains, "One of the drivers is the perceived usefulness of the language in a real-world context. Students (and their parents) often have opinions which language is 'better' to learn. In forming these opinions, the definition of 'better' can often be vague and driven by limited insight. One strong aspect commonly cited is the perceived usefulness of a language in the 'real world.' If a language is widely used in industry, it is more likely to be seen as a useful language to learn." Kölling's recommendation? "We need a new language for teaching novices at secondary school and introductory university level," Kölling concludes. "This language should be designed explicitly for teaching [...] Maintenance and adaptation of this language should be driven by pedagogical considerations, not by industry needs." While noble in intent, one suspects Kaplan and Kölling may be on a quixotic quest in a money wins world, outgunned by the demands, resources, and influence of tech giants like Amazon — the top employer of Northeastern MSCS program grads — who pushed back against NSF advice to deemphasize Java in high school CS and dropped $15 million to have tech-backed nonprofit Code.org develop and push a new Java-based, powered-by-AWS CS curriculum into high schools with the support of a consortium of politicians, educators, and tech companies. Echoing Northeastern, an Amazon press release argued the new Java-based curriculum "best prepares students for the next step in their education and careers."

 In November the Steam Survey reflected a 2.03% marketshare for Linux... Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. 

 In fact, December "saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey," according to TechSpot — "up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%..."
Elsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.
Rounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... 

Phoronix adds that the Windows percent "pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>All Of The Ways The Ocean Can Kill You</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcycbWnNlU</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PCcycbWnNlU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 5 Jan 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ocean.

Soundwaves: The Symphony of Physics 
Sound is one of the most vivid ways we interact with the underlying science of the universe. A sound can make us laugh, cry or cower in fear, but it can also help us understand our world, how it works and what it's made of. Sound is something we all take for granted, but, in fact, when you hear something you're listening to the sound of pure physics. In this engrossing two-part series Helen Czerski goes on a spectacular journey into the world of sound to discover what it is and what it reveals about the fundamental forces of nature.

With over 3,000 problems, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lost.Which problems should you solve? How many problems are enough for coding interviews?How much time should you spend on each problem?I will answer these questions and more in this article to make your journey smoother, and lot less less painful.For context - I’ve solved more than 1,500 LeetCode problems and cleared interviews at multiple big tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and in this article I’ll share everything I’ve learned to help you start and navigate LeetCode more effectively.I’ll share practical tips and resources to help you save time, stay focused and build your problem-solving skills without feeling overwhelmed.Why do you even need LeetCode?You might be wondering: why is everyone doing LeetCode questions. Is it really necessary to land a Software Engineering job?The short answer is: .There are plenty of startups and smaller companies that focus more on your experience with specific tech stacks and the projects you’ve built. They might not even include LeetCode style questions in their interview process.But if your goal is to work at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, you would need to practice LeetCode style questions since that’s what they ask in their interviews.Which programming language to choose?This is a question I get asked all the time.Many people get stuck at deciding which programming language to use.But here’s the truth: It doesn’t really matter. A programming language is just a tool. Once you understand the approach to solving a problem, you can implement it in any language.In my experience giving interviews, unless the job specifically requires expertise in a certain language, you’ll be fine using any language you’re comfortable with.The point is, LeetCode isn’t about syntax. It’s about using the right data structures, algorithms, and your ability to think critically and solve problems.That said, if you’re new to coding, I recommend starting with  It’s beginner-friendly and has a simpler syntax.If you already know a language—stick with it. Whether it’s C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go, there’s no need to switch.You don’t need to be an expert in your chosen language, but you should know the basics like:and input/output operationsBeyond the basics, spend some time learning the  for common data structures and algorithms.These libraries save time and let you focus on solving the problem rather than reimplementing data structures from scratch.Python has lists, dictionaries, and sets.Java has ArrayList, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.C++ offers the STL library with vector, map, and set.Before diving into LeetCode problems, it’s good to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.Basic Data Structures like Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.and Fundamental Algorithms like Sorting techniques, binary search, and recursion.Recursion is particularly important, since many problems specially tree and graph related ones rely heavily on it.When you’re familiar with these topics, it becomes much easier to recognize which concept applies to a specific problem.You don’t need to dive too deeply into every topic upfront. Most of your understanding will develop naturally as you solve problems.There are plenty of resources available online to help you get started. Don’t waste time searching for the “perfect” resource—pick one and start learning.The focus should always be on progress, not perfection.Here are some resources I personally found quite useful: It’s my second channel where I upload animated tutorials on DSA and LeetCode patterns.Here’s a comprehensive list of DSA topics you should know for coding interviews:Learn one topic at a timeIf you’re a beginner, focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.For example: Start with , the move to , then progress to more complex topics like , , and .This approach helps you develop a deeper understanding of each topic and teaches you how to recognize when to use a particular data structure or algorithm.Once you’ve learned the basics of a topic and understand how to implement it from scratch, it’s time to put your knowledge to the test.Solve 4-5 easy problems related to that topic on LeetCode.and Build confidence in applying the concepts.If you want to learn more about how to master a DSA topic, you can check out this article where I discuss it in more detail:Which problems should you solve?If you open LeetCode, there are over That number alone can feel overwhelming. So, how do you decide which ones to solve?Start with  for each topic. These are perfect for building confidence and understanding the basics of problem-solving.Once you’re comfortable with the easy ones, gradually challenge yourself with slightly harder problems that push you beyond your comfort zone.Remember, real growth happens when you constantly Don’t worry about hard problems in the beginning.Most coding interviews focus on , so that’s where you should spend the majority of your time.These lists are excellent, and I highly recommend solving every problem on them.How many problems should you solve?There’s no magic number, but from my experience,  is the sweet spot.However, it’s not about solving just any 300 problems. Focus on  that cover the most topics and patterns.To make it easier for you, I’ve created a : a curated list of the Top 300 LeetCode Problems organized into that are most commonly asked in coding interviews.You can find it on  Just head to the practice page. You will see a structured list  that you can follow from top to bottom.Resources to help you learn the topics.Ability to track your progress and mark problems for future revision.Links to GitHub and YouTube solutions.and ability to filter problems based on pattern, difficulty level and status.Don’t rush through problems just to increase your count. Instead of focusing on the quantity of problems you solve, focus on what you learn from each problem.It’s far better to deeply understand and solve 50 problems than to superficially solve 500 problems.After solving a problem, ask yourself:Why does this solution work?What’s the one key insight that made everything else easier?Also, try to make it fun. There is a fun in learning to solve coding challenges. It’s not just about getting a job.Focus on learning PatternsThe key to getting better at LeetCode is learningas manypatterns as possible.Instead of focusing on individual questions, focus on identifying  that connect similar problems.On LeetCode, you’ll come across multiple problems that follow a similar patterns. Once you solve one of them, you can apply the same approach to solve others.For example: After learning the monotonic stack , I was able to solve over 10 similar problems.I made a  covering the 15 most important LeetCode patterns I learned after solving over 1,500 problems. You can check it out later.On , I’ve categorized problems by pattern. This makes it easy to focus on one pattern at a time. By going through the list, you will get to know all the important patterns for coding interviews.How to approach a new problem?1. Read the Problem Statement TwiceThe first time, focus on getting the big picture. What is the problem asking you to do?On the second read, pay attention to specific constraints and conditions. These small details often provide clues for optimizing your solution.2. Analyze the Input and Output ExamplesCarefully go through the examples provided in the problem.Walk through the input and output step by step to understand how the problem works. I have found that, many times simply walking through a few examples helped me figure out the solution.3. Visualize with pen and paperMany problems specially the ones related to trees and graphs are much easier to understand when you draw them out.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios and input sizes. Think about any  that might come up.4. Start with a Brute Force ApproachDon’t expect to come up with the most optimal solution right away.First see, if you can solve the problems using a brute force approach. While it might not be efficient, it gives you a baseline to improve upon.5. Optimize Your SolutionOnce you have a brute force solution, focus on optimizing it.Here are few things to consider:Leverage Unused Information: Look for details you might have missed. For instance, if the problem states that the array is sorted, consider leveraging this to use binary search or a two-pointer approach.: If certain calculations are repeated multiple times, consider precomputing them. Use techniques like  or  to avoid redundant calculations. Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.Make Time vs. Space Tradeoffs: Sometimes, using additional memory (e.g., hash tables) can speed up your solution.Data Structure Brainstorm: Run through the popular data structures and try to apply each one to the problem at hand.Avoid overcomplicating your solution. At every stage ask yourself, "Is there a simpler way to do this?". This will not only make your solution easier to understand but it will also reduce the chances of errors during coding.7. Analyze Time and Space ComplexityDevelop the habit of analyzing the time and space complexity of every problem you submit.How much time should you spend on each problem?When you’re just starting out, even  can take a while to solve. That’s completely normal—don’t get discouraged if you can’t come up with a solution right away.Your main goal in the beginning should be to  and understanding the problem deeply. Real progress happens when you take the time to think, make mistakes and refine your approach.But, some problems involve specific tricks or patterns that are hard to figure out unless you’ve seen them before.Spending hours on such problems without progress can be counterproductive.Here’s a good rule of thumb:Give yourself  of focused effort for each problem.If you’re still stuck, it’s okay to look at hints or solutions.Read the official solution and and try to understand the top voted solutions on LeetCode discussion forum.Don’t just move on after viewing the solution. Try to grasp why the solution works.Rewrite the solution from scratch without looking at the code. Writing it yourself helps you internalize the approach and ensures you truly understand it.If you couldn’t solve the problem on your first attempt, mark it for  and revisit it after a few weeks. Revisiting problems helps reinforce your understanding and ensures long-term retention.One of the most common mistakes—one that I made myself—is  to difficult problems and moving on.At first, it might seem like a shortcut, but in reality, it’s a  for three main reasons:You’ll quickly forget memorized solutions. Without understanding the logic behind them, they won’t stick in your memory.Your problem-solving skills won’t improve. Memorization skips the critical thinking process, which is the real value of practicing coding problems.You’ll struggle in interviews. Most interviewers ask variants of problems or follow-up questions, and without a deep understanding, you won’t be able to adapt.Instead of memorizing, focus on understanding the solution, even if it takes hours.Break it down step by step and ask yourself:Why does this approach work?What’s the key insight that simplifies the problem?How can I apply this approach to similar problems?This effort pays off in the long term. The deeper your understanding, the more confident you’ll feel explaining your thought process during interviews.Practice in a timed environmentSolving a problem during an interview is very different from solving it from the comfort of your home.That’s why it’s a good idea to time-box yourself and practice in a timed environment after you have learned the basics and solved 100-150 problems.Simply turn on a timer while practicing and try to complete the problem within that time.For , aim to complete them in For , set a timer for For , allow yourself To take your practice a step further:Try  by simulating past LeetCode contests.It’s okay if you struggle to solve even one problem initially—this is normal. The goal is to gain experience solving problems within a time limit.When I started participating in contests, I could only solve 1-2 problems. But with consistent practice, I improved to solving 3 problems, and eventually, I was able to solve all of them in some contests.Getting good at LeetCode isn’t just about learning new concepts or solving problems—it’s also about retaining that knowledge over time.That’s why you should regularly revisit concepts and problems you’ve already solved, especially the ones you found challenging.Try to solve those problems again without looking at the solution.By practicing consistently and revisiting old problems, you’ll make it much easier to retain what you’ve learned over time.I discuss more about how to effectively revise LeetCode problems in this article, so make sure to check it out: Getting good at LeetCode takes time.Some topics might take weeks or even months to master, and that’s okay. Be patient with yourself and remember: It’s completely normal to feel stuck or frustrated when working on a tough problem or grasping a complex topic.If a problem feels too hard, take a break, then come back to it with a fresh perspective.The more you practice, the better you will get at solving LeetCode problems.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>4 Hours Of Facts About The World Wars</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qU7wOvwJvU</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3qU7wOvwJvU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 4 Jan 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[00:00:00 - Switzerland and WWII: An Exemplary Neutrality?

Using techniques developed over 2,500 years ago, the team takes on the ultimate challenge of recreating a sarcophagus. Can modern hands replicate ancient ingenuity?

Taken from 'Building the Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

Amid this flurry of chaos, there exists an age-old profession - midwifery. You’d think helping parents bring their children into this world would be considered a noble pursuit. But being a midwife has never been simple. They were lauded as heroes in one century, persecuted as witches in the next, and are still given the occasional side-eye today.

As always he is joined by Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson who talks him through the history of all the pistols, rifles and machine guns employed in the conflict.

First up is the Webley Revolver Mk VI, first introduced during the stalemate of static and bloody trench warfare in 1915. Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley’s returning to front line service in the conflict.

Second is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.

Third up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.

Last but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren’s box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition.

--

For years, Jean Béliveau walked from country to country, with the goal of circumnavigating the globe on foot. While few people have the time or desire to walk such extreme lengths, research shows that adding even a modest amount of walking to your daily routine can dramatically improve your health. So, what exactly happens to your body when you increase your step count? Shannon Odell investigates.

The mission put a man on the moon for the very first time, winning the Space Race for the United States.  

The rocket that made it possible was Saturn V. As tall as a 36-story building, it was the most powerful that had ever flown, symbolising American technological dominance during the Cold War. 

And yet, the man who designed it had a dark past. During the Second World War, he had been at the forefront of the Nazi Secret Weapons programme, designing weapons which cost thousands of lives. His name was Werner von Braun.

*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film “The woman in the moon” (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film - used for illustrative purposes in the video - was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it’s technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work.

They determine which items are removed to make room for new ones.In this article, we’ll dive into 7 Cache Eviction Strategies explaining what they are, how they work, their pros and cons. provides deep session replays with every detail you need to find and fix a bug. From frontend screens to backend traces, metrics, and logs, all in one place. Debug faster and fix customer problems more easily, so you and your team can stay focused on building great software, not combing through APM data. (LRU) evicts the item that hasn’t been used for the longest time.The idea is simple: if you haven’t accessed an item in a while, it’s less likely to be accessed again soon.: LRU keeps track of when each item in the cache was last accessed. This can be done using various data structures, such as a  or a combination of a  and a .Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, it is moved to the  position in the tracking data structure (e.g., moving it to the front of a list).Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the item isn’t in the cache and the cache has free space, it is added directly.If the cache is full, the  is evicted to make space for the new item.The item that has been accessed least recently (tracked at the beginning of the list) is removed from the cache.Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:: Empty cache.Access  → Cache: [B, C, A] (A becomes recently used)Add → Cache: [C, A, D] (B is evicted as it's the “least recently used”): Easy to understand and widely adopted.: Keeps frequently accessed items in the cache.Optimized for Real-World Usage: Matches many access patterns, such as web browsing and API calls.: Tracking usage order can consume additional memory.: For large caches, maintaining the access order may introduce computational overhead.: Assumes past access patterns will predict future usage, which may not always hold true. (LFU) evicts the item with the lowest access frequency. It assumes that items accessed less frequently in the past are less likely to be accessed in the future.Unlike LRU, which focuses on , LFU emphasizes  of access.: LFU maintains a frequency count for each item in the cache, incrementing the count each time the item is accessed.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, its frequency count is increased.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the cache has available space, the new item is added with an initial frequency count of 1.If the cache is full, the item with the lowest frequency is evicted to make room for the new item. If multiple items share the same lowest frequency, a secondary strategy (like LRU or FIFO) resolves ties.: Remove the item with the smallest frequency count.Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:: Empty cache.Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=1), D (freq=1)] (B is evicted as it has the lowest frequency).Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=2), D (freq=1)]Efficient for Predictable Patterns: Retains frequently accessed data, which is often more relevant.Highly Effective for Popular Data: Works well in scenarios with clear "hot" items.: Requires additional memory to track frequency counts.: Tracking and updating frequency can slow down operations.: May keep items that were frequently accessed in the past but are no longer relevant.3. First In, First Out (FIFO)FIFO evicts the item that was added first, regardless of how often it’s accessed.FIFO operates under the assumption that items added earliest are least likely to be needed as the cache fills up.: When an item is added to the cache, it is placed at the end of the queue.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): No changes are made to the order of items. FIFO does not prioritize recently accessed items.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If there is space in the cache, the new item is added to the end of the queue.If the cache is full, the item at the front of the queue (the oldest item) is evicted to make space for the new item.: The oldest item, which has been in the cache the longest, is removed to make room for the new item.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is evicted because it was added first).Access  → Cache: [B, C, D] (Order remains unchanged).Add  → Cache: [C, D, E] (B is evicted because it was the oldest remaining item).: FIFO is straightforward and requires minimal logic.: No need to track additional metadata like access frequency or recency.: Eviction follows a predictable order.: Items still in frequent use can be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.Suboptimal for Many Use Cases: FIFO is rarely ideal in modern systems where recency and frequency matter.: If old but frequently used items are evicted, the cache loses its utility.4. Random Replacement (RR)RR cache eviction strategy is the simplest of all: when the cache is full, it evicts a random item to make space for a new one.It doesn't track recency, frequency, or insertion order, making it a lightweight approach with minimal computational overhead.This simplicity can sometimes be surprisingly effective, especially in systems with unpredictable or highly dynamic access patterns.: When an item is added to the cache and there is space, it is stored directly. If the requested item exists in the cache, it is served, and no changes are made to the cache. If the item is not in the cache and the cache is full, a random item is removed.: The randomly selected item is removed, and the new item is added to the cache.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is randomly evicted).Add  → Cache: [C, E, D] (B is randomly evicted).: No need for metadata like access frequency or recency.: Computational and memory requirements are minimal.Fair for Unpredictable Access Patterns: Avoids bias toward recency or frequency, which can be useful in some scenarios.: A frequently used item might be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.Inefficient for Stable Access Patterns: Doesn’t adapt well when certain items are consistently accessed.High Risk of Poor Cache Hit Rates: Random eviction often leads to suboptimal retention of important items.5. Most Recently Used (MRU) is the opposite of Least Recently Used (LRU). In MRU, the item that was accessed most recently is the first to be evicted when the cache is full.The idea behind MRU is that the most recently accessed item is likely to be a temporary need and won’t be accessed again soon, so evicting it frees up space for potentially more valuable data.: When a new item is added to the cache, it is marked as the most recently used.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, it is marked as the most recently used.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the cache has available space, the new item is added directly.If the cache is full, the most recently used item is evicted to make room for the new item.: The item that was accessed or added most recently is removed.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Access  → Cache: [A, B, C] (C is marked as the most recently used).Add  → Cache: [A, B, D] (C is evicted as it was the most recently used).Access  → Cache: [A, B, D] (B becomes the most recently used).Add  → Cache: [A, D, E] (B is evicted as it was the most recently used).Effective in Specific Scenarios: Retains older data, which might be more valuable in certain workloads.: Requires minimal metadata.Suboptimal for Most Use Cases: MRU assumes recent data is less valuable, which is often untrue for many applications.Poor Hit Rate in Predictable Patterns: Fails in scenarios where recently accessed data is more likely to be reused.: Limited applicability compared to other strategies like LRU or LFU. is a cache eviction strategy where each cached item is assigned a fixed lifespan. Once an item’s lifespan expires, it is automatically removed from the cache, regardless of access patterns or frequency.This ensures that cached data remains fresh and prevents stale data from lingering in the cache indefinitely.: When an item is added to the cache, a TTL value (e.g., 10 seconds) is assigned to it. The expiration time is usually calculated as .Cache Access (Hit or Miss): When an item is accessed, the cache checks its expiration time:If the item is expired, it is removed from the cache, and a cache miss is recorded.If the item is valid, it is served as a cache hit.: Expired items are automatically removed either during periodic cleanup or on access.Let’s assume a cache with a TTL of 5 seconds:Add  with TTL = 5s → Cache: [A (expires in 5s)]Add  with TTL = 10s → Cache: [A (5s), B (10s)]After 6 seconds → Cache: [B (expires in 4s)] (A is evicted because its TTL expired).Add  with TTL = 5s → Cache: [B (4s), C (5s)]If an item is accessed after its TTL expires, it results in a cache miss.TTL is often implemented in caching systems like  or , where you can specify expiration times for each key.: Automatically removes stale data, ensuring only fresh items remain in the cache.: TTL values are easy to assign during cache insertion.: No need to track usage patterns or access frequency.: Stale data is cleared out systematically, avoiding cache bloat.: Items may be evicted prematurely even if they are frequently accessed.: Items that haven’t expired but are still irrelevant occupy cache space.: TTL doesn’t adapt to dynamic workloads or usage patterns.Two-Tiered Caching combines two layers of cache—usually a  (in-memory) and a  (distributed or shared). The local cache serves as the first layer (hot cache), providing ultra-fast access to frequently used data, while the remote cache acts as the second layer (cold cache) for items not found in the local cache but still needed relatively quickly.:Resides on the same server as the application, often in memory (e.g., ,  in the application)..Provides ultra-fast access to frequently accessed data, reducing latency and server load.Examples: In-memory data structures like  or frameworks like .Remote Cache (Second Tier):Shared across multiple servers in the system. Slightly slower due to network overhead but offers larger storage and shared consistency.Used to store data that is not in the local cache but is still frequently needed.Examples: Distributed cache systems like  or .A client request checks the  first.If the data is not found (cache miss), it queries the .If the data is still not found (another cache miss), it retrieves the data from the primary data source (e.g., a database), stores it in both the local and remote caches, and returns it to the client.: Local cache provides near-instantaneous response times for frequent requests.: Remote cache adds scalability and allows data sharing across multiple servers.: Two-tiered caching significantly minimizes calls to the backend database.: If the local cache fails, the remote cache acts as a fallback.: Managing two caches introduces more overhead, including synchronization and consistency issues.: Inconsistent updates between tiers may lead to serving stale data.Increased Latency for Remote Cache Hits: Accessing the second-tier remote cache is slower than the local cache.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Story: Leaving Stripe</title><link>https://corecursive.com/leaving-stripe-with-jon-de-le-motte/</link><author>Adam@corecursive.com (Adam@corecursive.com)</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/corecursive/leaving_stripe2.mp3?dest-id=628353" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 2 Jan 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://corecursive.com/">Podcast - CoRecursive</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if leaving your dream job was the way to discover your true self?   Jon de la Motte failed his first Stripe interview, but he didn't give up.

Watson, a renowned psychologist, and Rosalie Rayner, his assistant and eventual wife, decided to combine love, science, and a fair bit of cluelessness in an experiment that would go down in history as “The Little Albert Experiment.” The idea was bold, the execution debatable, and the results as ethically murky as a midsummer mud puddle. Thus, in a story one might mistake for the beginning of a Dickensian epic, Little Albert’s fate was sealed.

I mainly write in Rust where I used to write in Go. Overall, the language is more complex than Go and sometimes confusing with the borrow checker, but in general, it is quite convenient to write – I can't say that the speed of writing code significantly decreases compared to other languages – in general, the approaches that need to be used are roughly the same for all languages.crates ecosystem – many libraries available and can be installed in one commandsingle binary file and low memory consumptionability to write applications of various directions (web-app, tui, gui, parsers, etc.)What I don't like about Rust:a large number of sub-dependencies for web projects (any project on axum will contain 200+ dependencies)use of C-binding in "core" libraries like rust-tls (ring) – complicates cross-compilation because you have to maintain a C toolchain as well (fixed through Zig build, but it looks monstrous)It's nice to write various parsers in Rust, and then they can be coolly parallelized (with rayon or tokio), in Go I had a problems with this due to immutable strings and lack of GC control.The main languages remained the same: Python, NodeJS/TypeScript. I also actively used NextJS on several projects, overall I was satisfied – it's faster and easier to write frontends, but it's quite difficult to find problem's solutions sometimes (many Github issues, often they are open, and the comments contain answers that no longer work).The main fail of the year in the NodeJS ecosystem is the update of ESLint from 8 -> 9 – completely incompatible API with all existing plugins, the configuration file became larger and more complex – it's not clear why the authors made this diversion. I also tried Binome as an alternative to ESLint / Prettier, but it's completely different and you need to redo a lot, and not everything you need is available at the moment, I continue to monitor this project.I also tried Zig, but didn't write anything serious. Personally, I didn't understand why this language is needed. At the time I tried it, there was no even package manager yet. Obviously Zig is a competitor to C (not Rust), but C is now much richer in its toolkit and support in other languages. The only thing I can point out is  which can build C projects too and does it with less problems.I want to separately note about use of GPTs in work. I have an opportunity to do business tasks in the format of parsing and analyzing texts. What a couple of years ago was done with a bunch of regex, etc., can now be done through GPT and it works great! I tried using local Llama2, but it would have taken weeks to process my data on M2 chip. I redo the solution to use ChatGPT API and processed the data in a couple of days. It's good that all LLMs support openai-client API in Python, so the code almost didn't need to be rewritten. Among the disadvantages of LLama-like aka local running, I also want to note the lack of support for Function calling (to guarantee to bring the LLM response to the desired structure, in my case). The last time I did something serious was more than six months ago, maybe a lot has changed. I also tested gemma2, the inference speed was impressive, and the quality of the answers was not much worse.As local runners, I used llama.cpp and https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx – the second one uses Mac resources better (checked through macmon), but new models come out a bit slower on it. Some people use ollama, but I didn't understand why, considering that it has an incompatible client with openai-client API and slower performance.Initially, I ran my blog only on Medium, but it's not comfortable to write text there – it's much easier to write and edit in the same editor where I write code (plus my editor has Copilot). Therefore, I decided to move my blog to a static page generator. As an engine, I chose Zola (Rust-based, simple, and fast); I also tried Astro, but it's too big and complex for such a simple task. Overall, Zola is good, but it lacks some filters in templating, not enough flexibility in file structure, and not all popular languages are supported in code highlighting.I left Medium as a fallback for old readers. I also made a cross-post on dev.to, but there are very few views. Medium is disappointed with the lack of the ability to automate cross-posting (they have a deprecated API, but it does not support updating articles and code highlights). Most likely, it's possible to reverse engineer how they save articles through their editor (changes are sent as diffs). Does anyone else need this besides me?Last year I launched several new projects (in chronological order):timewiz.cc (, ) – a tool to find common working hours for distributed teams (an alternative to worldtimebuddy.com, I don't remember exactly why I made my own version). Score: fail.ecloop (, ) – secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation for Apple chips. Mainly an educational project to understand cryptography, SIMD optimizations, etc. Added several standard use cases for finding Bitcoin keys by brute force, but mathematically this is pointless, so as I said earlier, this is more of an interesting educational project (and I wanted to publish a series of articles on cryptography, but didn't have time last year, I hope to do it this year). Some people use this project in hopes of finding something. I also had ideas to add Metal API support – but that takes a lot of time, so I switched to other projects. Score: okay.macmon (, ) – TUI program for monitoring MacOS performance (CPU/GPU/ANE usage, RAM, temps). My first public Rust project, a lot of reverse engineering of how powermetrics in MacOS works, C-bindings. The project is used both by users in TUI mode and by other projects in headless mode (JSON metrics). Score: success.ghstats (, , , ) – a small self-hosted service that collects and saves GitHub repo statistics, has several built-in views and an API to retrieve all statistics. The project started well, but then kind of fizzled out in terms of issues and feature requests, most likely users are satisfied with the current functionality. I would like to add more visualizations, but I haven't had time for that yet. The main thing for now is that the statistics are collected and saved, so something can be done with this in the future. Technically, I like that the service consumes only 10 MB of RAM. Score: okay.ogp (, , ) – a small project for generating OGP articles preview as a service. Used in this blog (you can check by sending this article to your friends in a messenger or social network 😀). Worked with the SVG standard (I thought it was more adequate) and generating PNG from SVG. Score: more of fail.compose-updater (, ) – a project for updating the version of a docker image from CI in a closed infrastructure. I didn't find anything ready to solve this task. There is watchtower, but it's more about keeping up-to-date docker images, rather than updating a specific one, and also I couldn't run it with ECR repos – the author made a super minimalist image in which I couldn't enter through  to debug. The second alternative is umputun/updater, but it's more about running different shell commands through a webhook. I chose Python because I didn't find a Rust crate for Docker API (most likely it exists, I just didn't understand which one is really good). Score: – (I didn't promote the project anywhere, I use it for my own purposes for now).twscrape (, ) – a library for parsing data from X/Twitter. Mainly the project is in maintenance mode, I check its functionality every few months, and there have been no requests for new features.apigen-ts (, ) – a library for generating TypeScript client OpenAPI spec. I continue to use it in my projects; I also see that there are a small number of other users. My relevance has slightly decreased due to the NextJS/TRPC stack, but in other configurations (e.g. FastApi + React), it is still relevant, so use it. Periodically there are requests to fix something or add a feature.I also have several projects that I didn't finish and abandoned. I'll write about them here, maybe someone needs something from this, then I can return to on it. – cross-posting between static blog, Medium, Dev.to, Substack, and collecting joined article statistics. I abandoned the project due to the lack of an API at Medium – the only solution I found was through protocol reverse and session cookie. – a program to walk Bitcoin-like blockchain and compile the final UTXO list. I abandoned it because I couldn't figure out how to effectively create a HashMap-like structure with external memory support to run on computers with small RAM (less than 32GB, LOL). – a program that listens to all incoming messages in Telegram (chats & channels) and saves their history in a separate database with the ability to search through these messages later. I have the first version that just saves messages in json files, but I didn't develop the idea further.I'm not a big tech geek, but I want to say about a few devices which made my life easier:MeLE Fanless Quieter 4C – a small fanless PC for , I use it as a native Linux via SSH for testing various programs and keep some cron jobs on it for data collection. It's cool that it's silent because it has no fan, but it heats up a lot under load. The performance of the N100 chip surprised me – only 2x slower than M2 chip (tested with , single core).Promate HDMI-PD100 – nice cable format to connect a monitor and my Mac. One cable is needed to charge and transmit the video stream. Before that, I used hubs, but it's a big block. I'm glad I see fewer wires.Over the year, 8 articles were published, totaling 9039 words (~45 minutes to read), and gained 5203 views. Top 3 articles:Data aggregated from this site (with umami), Medium, and Dev.to. Script.Public GitHub projects – totaling 312 commits, 49 issues closed, 43 releases created, and 1394 stars gained. Top-3 repos:Data aggregated with .I hope I will see a different top with new projects this year 😀In  repository I was asked to make it possible to send coffee as donations. Over the year I received 38 cups of coffee from 10 people. I spend these coffees on an annual Parallels subscription, which allows me to test some apps on Windows. Also, I partially paid from this fund for MeLE and VPS, which I used to test apps as well. Many thanks for supporting my work!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Were Britain&apos;s Secret Agencies Working Against Each Other In WW2?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVt-LomZkjU</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZVt-LomZkjU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How did the Nazis penetrate the French Resistance?

With Windows 10 reaching end of support in October 2025, many users will face decisions about upgrading hardware for Windows 11 or considering different operating systems entirely. Linux distributions have evolved to offer increasingly polished desktop experiences, with improving hardware compatibility and familiar user interfaces. 

2024 saw Linux adoption grow thanks to the Steam Deck's success, reaching a 4.04% market share in December, up from 3.85% during the same time last year.

One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys two years ago, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Fall of Constantinople</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/constantinople-under-siege</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/674743e8c4b78e9ebb2064e2/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=vNg47WpHjJSjC34JWPVeYv7k2j1pKhjuB3ggmc979TA" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[May 1453 saw the siege that would lead to the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire. It was the culmination of an age-long struggle between Christianity and Islam for control of the Eastern Mediterranean. The Ottoman leader Mehmed II had dreamed of possessing the city since he was a boy, and now the shining light of Christian civilization, which had lasted 1100 years, fell into the hands of Ottomans. In this episode of , Matt Lewis is joined by Prof. Marc David Baer to delve into this epochal moment in medieval history.This episode was edited and produced by Joseph Knight and Rob Weinberg.

Over time, MTV became the home of everything from Beavis and Butthead to Jackass to Teen Mom. Naturally, in the process of courting young people’s attention, MTV has courted controversy. All those programs mentioned above, plus many more, have pushed the envelope of good taste and what’s acceptable on TV.
