The robots successfully manipulated needles, tied knots, and sutured wounds independently, demonstrating ability to correct errors like dropped needles without human input. Testing has advanced to full surgeries on animal cadavers. 

Researchers aim to address a projected U.S. surgeon shortage of 10,000-20,000 by 2036. The technology builds on decades of robot-assisted surgery, which recorded 876,000 procedures in 2020.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The US tech group, best known for the infrastructure that has underpinned the AI boom, is set to launch its latest generation of compact computers for humanoid robots [non-paywalled link] -- dubbed Jetson Thor -- in the first half of 2025. 

Nvidia is positioning itself to be the leading platform for what the tech group believes is an imminent robotics revolution. The company sells a "full stack" solution, from the layers of software for training AI-powered robots to the chips that go into them. [...] Talla said a shift in the robotics market is being driven by two technological breakthroughs: the explosion of generative AI models and the ability to train robots on these foundational models using simulated environments. The latter has been a particularly significant development as it helps solve what roboticists call the "Sim-to-Real gap," ensuring robots trained in virtual environments can operate effectively in the real world, he said.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

He was 100.

2. South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok ordered an emergency safety inspection on Monday of the country's entire airline operation system as investigators worked to identify victims and find out what caused the deadliest air disaster in the country.

5. Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks broadcast on Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month.

Carlsen had withdrawn from the New York tournament when officials demanded he change out of jeans he wore after a lunch meeting, threatening him with fines and disqualification. FIDE revised its dress code following the incident, permitting "appropriate jeans matching the jacket" as an "elegant minor deviation" from standard attire.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

"I've always liked the visas. I have many H-1B visas on my properties... It's a great program," Trump told The New York Post. 

His comments follow recent support for the program from Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The H-1B program allows 85,000 skilled workers to immigrate annually, including 20,000 spots for those with U.S. advanced degrees. Trump's businesses have received approval to hire over 2,100 foreign workers since 2008, with about 70 positions through H-1B visas, mostly over a decade ago.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Carter, a Democrat, became president in January 1977 after defeating incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Despite his difficulties in office, Carter had few rivals for accomplishments as a former president. He gained global acclaim as a tireless human rights advocate, winning the respect that eluded him in the White House.

But the Seattle Times says an analysis of reports to Congress found "an overwhelmed system delivering underwhelming results for whistleblowers... More than 90% of safety complaints from 2020 through 2023 ended with no violation found by the FAA, while whistleblowers reported them at great personal and professional risk."

Aside from the FAA's in-house program, employees of Boeing, Spirit and the FAA can report safety hazards to the Office of Special Counsel, which has no FAA ties, or through internal employer complaint programs, such as Boeing's Speak Up and Spirit's Quality 360, to trigger company reviews... In the aftermath of the door-plug blowout over Portland, Boeing specifically asked its employees to use the Speak Up program or the FAA's internal process to report any concerns, according to Boeing spokesperson Jessica Kowal. Both have done a poor job protecting whistleblowers from retaliation, according to a congressionally appointed expert panel... While both were designed to guard against retaliation, critics say they have instead become enablers of it... 

A panel of aviation safety experts in February rebuked Boeing's Speak Up program in a report to Congress. Whistleblower advocates criticized Speak Up for commonly outing whistleblowers to the supervisors they're complaining about, exposing them to retaliation. Managers sometimes investigated complaints against themselves. Employees mistrusted the program's promise of anonymity. Collectively, the befuddling maze of whistleblower options sowed "confusion about reporting systems that may discourage employees from submitting safety concerns," according to the expert panel's report.... 

[Boeing quality inspector Sam Mohawk, who alleged the 737 MAX line in Renton was losing track of subpar aircraft parts], continues to pursue his FAA claim, originally submitted through Boeing's Speak Up program. Months passed before Boeing addressed Mohawk's complaint. When it did, Mohawk's report was passed to the managers he was complaining about, according to Brian Knowles, Mohawk's South Carolina-based lawyer. "If you do Speak Up, just know that your report is going to go straight to the guys you're accusing of wrongdoing. They aren't going to say, 'Thanks for speaking up against us,'" Knowles said. 
The article includes this quote about the FAA's in-house whistleblower program from Tom Devine, a whistleblower attorney with nearly a half-century of experience across a spectrum of federal agencies, and legal director of the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, which helps whistleblowers navigate the federal system. "It's been a disaster from the beginning. We tell everyone to avoid it because it's a trap... We've warned whistleblowers not to entrust their rights there."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

              <p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/passkey-technology-is-elegant-but-its-most-definitely-not-usable-security/">Read full article</a></p>

<h2 id="5conclusions">5. Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this work, we propose a revised approach to NLPre evaluation via benchmarking. This is motivated by the widespread use of the benchmarking technique in other NLP fields on par with the shortcomings of existing NLPre evaluation solutions.</p>
<p>\
We implement said NLPre benchmarking approach as the online system that evaluates the submitted outcome of an NLPre system and updates the associated leaderboard with the results after the submitter’s approval. The benchmarking system is designed to rank NLPre tools available for a given language in a trustworthy environment.</p>
<p>\
The endeavour of defining and enhancing the system’s capabilities is conducted concurrently with the effort to create the NLPre benchmark for Polish that encompasses numerous factors, such as tasks not required in English or diverse tagsets. The NLPre-PL benchmark consists of the predefined NLPre tasks, coupled with two reformulated datasets. The NLPre-PL benchmark, therefore, sets the standard for evaluating the performance of the NLPre tools for Polish, which represents a derivative yet important outcome of our research.</p>
<p>\
In addition to integration into the benchmarking system, NLPre-PL is used to conduct empirical experiments. We perform a robust and extensive comparison of different NLPre methods, including the classical non-neural tools and the modern neural network-based techniques. The results of these experiments on datasets in two tagsets are discussed in detail. The experiments confirm our assumptions that modern architectures obtain better results. Because NLP is a discipline undergoing rapid progress, new NLPre solutions, e.g. multilingual or zero-shot, can be expected in the coming years. These new solutions can be easily tested and compared with the tools evaluated so far in our benchmarking system.</p>
<p>\
Finally, we release the open-source code of the benchmarking system in hopes that this endeavour could be replicated for other languages. To expedite this process, we ensure that the system is fully configurable and language- and tagset-agnostic. The NLPre system, configured for a specified language, can be self-hosted on a chosen server, and the results from the leaderboard are conveniently accessible via an API. We see a potential future application of our system to the UD repository, where for 141 languages, there are currently 245 treebanks with supposedly discrepant versions of the UD tagset.</p>
<h2 id="6appendices">6. Appendices</h2>
<h3 id="61infrastructureused">6.1. Infrastructure used</h3>
<p>We train the models using several types of computational nodes at our disposal, including NVIDIA V100 32GB, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 8GB, NVIDIA GeForce 3070 8GB and Intel Xeon E5-2697 processor. Since we do not perform hyperparameter tuning, this should not impact our results.</p>
<h3 id="62furtherresultsofexperiments">6.2. Further results of experiments</h3>
<p>Herein, we present a comprehensive depiction of our experimental findings as they are displayed on the NLPre-PL leaderboard.</p>
<p>\
In Table 5, we present the full results of the evaluation of the selected models on the Morfeuszbased datasets byName and byType. These results are provided for all available tasks that can be performed on the above-mentioned datasets. As NKJP1M datasets contain no syntantic trees, it is thus impossible to test the dependency parsing task that rely on these trees and measure UAS, LAS, CLAS, MLAS and BLEX.</p>
<p>\
In Table 6, we present the results of the evaluation of the selected models on the UD-based datasets byName, byType, and PDB. This table contains the results of segmentation, tagging, and lemmatization tasks. Table 7 is a continuation of Table 6 and it contains the results for the same tagset and dataset on the dependency parsing task.</p>

<h2 id="43results">4.3. Results</h2>
<p><strong>Impact of system architecture</strong> We assess the quality of the selected NLPre systems contingent on the NLPre-PL benchmark. In Polish (and most other languages), non-neural NLPre tools are currently not widely developed. We evaluate two of them: Concraft and UDPipe. Although they do not use neural network algorithms to train models, their quality does not significantly differ from the best tested neural systems, especially in terms of segmentation, which UDPipe performs best (Words) or second-best (Sentences) (see Tables 2 and 3). We cannot unequivocally say that the system architecture has a decisive influence on the results, as spaCy models, even transformer-based, output the lowest quality.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Impact of tagset selection</strong> We compare systems trained and tested on data adjusted to two tagsets – the Morfeusz tagset (see Table 2) and the UD tagset (see Table 3). The average scores indicate that only COMBO performs better on Morfeusz-annotated data than on UD data. The performance of Trankit, UDPipe, and Stanza slightly decreases on Morfeusz data. Notably, all spaCy models trained on this dataset record a significant quality drop mainly due to poorly performed morphological analysis, i.e. UFeats values (and thus also the low AllTags values, i.e., matching between UPOS, XPOS, and UFeats). Regarding segmentation, UPOS and XPOS tagging, and lemmatisation, the tagset selection does not negatively affect the results, and the systems perform comparably.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Impact of the size of training data</strong> Intuitively, the size of the training data affects the prediction quality. Considering the data size factor, we compare the average F1 scores of the NLPre systems trained on NKJP1M (see the last row in Table 4) and on PDB-UD (see Table 4), which is two orders of magnitude smaller. The results confirm our intuitive assumptions – there is a difference of 6.21 between the mean F1 scores obtained by the systems trained on the smaller PDB-UD (avg. F1 of 88.16) and those trained on the larger NKJP1M (avg. F1 of 94.37).</p>
<p>\
When comparing the performance of individual systems on the smaller PDB-UD dataset, Trankit turns out to be the undisputed winner in all tasks except lemmatisation. However, considering the average performance of all tasks, COMBO and Stanza perform the best.</p>

In alignment with contemporary developments on zero-shot learning, we test the predictive capabilities of GPT-3.5 acquired via the prompting technique (Brown et al., 2020). Despite comprehensive instructions along with the UD tree examples in the prompt, the results are highly unsatisfactory. An error analysis has revealed that 1) the GPT model modifies the input texts (e.g. adds elided words, alters the word’s declension and conjugation, leading also to non-existent words); 2) while parsing questions, it answers them or returns information that they cannot be answered; 3) it replaces Polish words with their foreign equivalents; 4) it outputs graphs with cycles, thus not adhering to UD trees. Even for GPTs, achieving UD-compliant morphosyntactic analysis is challenging when they lack access to training examples. GPT-3.5’s results are not included in the leaderboard.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Impact of split heuristics</strong> As outlined in Section 3.1, NKJP1M has no official split into train, dev, and test subsets. Since intuitively, the type of document can affect text processing, we propose two alternative splits, i.e. byName and byType. We compare the F1 scores for these two splits to verify this hypothesis. For the byName split, the average F1 for tasks and systems is 90.69, and for the byType split, it is 90.56. The difference is negligible, indicating that the document type, and hence the text domain, does not affect the quality of the NLPre tasks. Based on this outcome, we arbitrarily choose the more balanced byType split as binding in the final NLPre-PL benchmarking system. The detailed results of all experiments are in Appendix 6.2.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Inference time</strong> In the context of benchmarking, quality is a fundamental factor. In our case, the best average F1 scores are achieved by COMBO and Stanza, far ahead of spaCy and Concraft. The second crucial issue is the processing time of the evaluated NLPre systems, especially their inference time.[20] We calculate the times in which the systems tokenise, tag and lemmatise the input text.[21] The exception is COMBO with the mandatory parsing module that cannot be disabled. Therefore, its calculations include the parsing time as well. The inference time, corresponding to the number of tokens processed per second, is provided in the last two columns of Tables 2 and 3. On CPU, the fastest systems are spaCy and UDPipe, and the slowest is Concraft. Other systems process one order of magnitude fewer tokens per second than the top ones. On GPU, spaCy is the undisputed winner, followed by Stanza, UDPipe, COMBO and Trankit.</p>

<p>\
Pearson’s correlation r suggests that the results are linearly proportional for the same models and different tagsets, which we conclude from the values close to 1 at the intersection of (model<em>i</em>, tagsetud) and (model<em>i</em>,  tagsetnkjp). Even though correlation coefficients are generally high (i.e. r ∈ [0.90, 0.99]) for most pairs (model<em>i</em>,  tagsetud) and (model<em>j,</em> tagsetnkjp), there are noticeable lower values for spaCy, i.e. r ∈ [0.66, 0.78]. We hypothesise that this is due to the non-linear rate of changes between the scores, as all Spearman correlation coefficients exceed 0.89 (i.e. ρ &gt; 0.89).</p>
<p>\

<p>\
The results of a more granular analysis of Pearson’s r between vectors of F1 scores for triples (tagseti , modelj , embeddingsk), averaged over datasets, show a strong correlation for the same models, regardless of the tagset and the embedding (see Figure 3). Hence, if a change in the tagset or embedding causes an increase in one task, a proportional increase in remaining tasks is expected.</p>
<p>\
Boxplot charts (see Figures 4 and 5) determine the stability of the model results for a given tagset regardless of dataset and embedding. One box shows the scattering of F1 scores for Tokens, Sentences, Words, UPOS, XPOS, and Lemmas tasks. The shortest COMBO’s box indicates a relatively similar performance of the model across tasks for each triplet (COMBO, embeddingj , datasetk).</p>

<h2 id="42evaluatedsystems">4.2. Evaluated systems</h2>
<p>Based on the NLPre-PL benchmark, we evaluate both well-rooted rule-based disambiguation methods and modern systems based on neural network architectures to enable an informative and thorough comparison of different approaches. We use the most up-to-date versions of available tools at the time of conducting experiments: (1) pipelines of separate tools (Concraft-pl, UDPipe), (2) systems integrating separate models for NLPre tasks (spaCy, Stanza, Trankit), (3) end-to-end systems with a model for all NLPre tasks (COMBO), and large language model GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Concraft-pl</strong> (Waszczuk, 2012; Waszczuk et al., 2018) [12] is a system for joint morphosyntactic disambiguation and segmentation.[13] It uses Morfeusz morphological analyser (Woliński, 2014; Kieraś and Woliński, 2017) to extract morphological and segmentation equivocates and then disambiguates them using the conditional random fields model. We train the Concraft-pl models with default parameters.</p>
<p>\
<strong>UDPipe</strong> (Straka and Straková, 2017) is a language-agnostic trainable NLPre pipeline.[14] Depending on the task, it uses recurrent neural networks (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) in segmentation and tokenization, the average perceptron in tagging and lemmatization, a rule-based approach in multi-word splitting, and a transition-based neural dependency parser. We train the UDPipe models with the default parameters. The dependency parser is trained with the Polish fastText embeddings (Grave et al., 2018).</p>
<p>\
<strong>SpaCy</strong> (Montani and Honnibal, 2022) is an NLP Python library shipped with pretrained pipelines and word vectors for multiple languages.[15] It also supports training the models for tagging and parsing, inter alia. We use spaCy to train pipelines for morphosyntactic analysis with: feed-forward network</p>

<p>\
based text encoders with static embeddings (fastText and pl-core-news-lg) or transformer-based encoders with the Polbert embeddings (Kłeczek, 2021), taggers (linear layers with softmax activation on top of the encoders), and transition-based parsers.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Stanza</strong> (Qi et al., 2020) is a language-agnostic, fully neural toolkit offering a modular pipeline for tokenization, multi-word token expansion, lemmatization, tagging, and dependency parsing.[16] It mainly uses recurrent neural networks (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005) as a base architecture and external word embeddings (fastText). Each module reuses the basic architecture.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Trankit</strong> (Nguyen et al., 2021b) uses a multilingual pre-trained transformer-based language model, XLM-Roberta (Conneau et al., 2019) as the text encoder which is then shared across pipelines for different languages.[17] The resulting model is jointly trained on 90 UD treebanks with a separate adapter (Pfeiffer et al., 2020a,b) for each treebank. Trankit uses a wordpiece-based splitter to exploit contextual information.</p>
<p>\
<strong>COMBO</strong> (Rybak and Wróblewska, 2018; Klimaszewski and Wróblewska, 2021) is a fully neural language-independent NLPre system[18] integrated with the LAMBO tokeniser (Przybyła, 2022). It is an end-to-end system with jointly trained modules for tagging, parsing, and lemmatisation. We train the COMBO models with the pre-trained word embeddings – fastText and HerBERT (Mroczkowski et al., 2021).</p>
<p>\
<strong>GPT-3.5</strong> (Brown et al., 2020) is a large language model, notable for its outstanding performance in NLU tasks. It is a fined-tuned version of the GPT-3 model. GPT-3.5’s architecture is based on a transformer neural network with 12 stacks of decoders blocks with multi-head attention blocks.</p>
<p>\
For segmentation tasks, we train modules integrated with the tested NLPre systems. The only aberration is in spaCy, where poor segmentation results of the dependency module[19] forced us to use an out-of-the-box sentenciser available in spaCy.</p>
<p>\
For each model, we initialise training with possibly the most prominent and congruent embedding model available. Virtually all models are capable of fully capitalising from that addition, apart from Concraft and UDPipe. The first does not use embeddings at all, and the latter uses them only for dependency parsing training. If embeddings based on BERT architecture are feasible to use, we select their base versions. This ensures fairness of comparison between NLPre systems, as not all of them support BERT-large embeddings.</p>

<h2 id="4evaluation">4. Evaluation</h2>
<h3 id="41evaluationmethodology">4.1. Evaluation methodology</h3>
<p>To maintain the de facto standard to NLPre evaluation, we apply the evaluation measures defined for the CoNLL 2018 shared task and implemented in the official evaluation script.[11] In particular, we focus on F1 and <em>AlignedAccuracy</em>, which is similar to F1 but does not consider possible misalignments in tokens, words, or sentences.</p>

In our evaluation process, we follow default training procedures suggested by the authors of the evaluated systems, i.e. we do not conduct any optimal hyperparameter search in favour of leaving the recommended model configuration as-is. We also do not further fine-tune selected models.</p>

After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance &mdash; and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you're not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be "the year of the AI PC," but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm... 

The key to Windows on Arm's revival this year was Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They've provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple's MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft's MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple's MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the "I'm a Mac" guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple's laptop dominance. 

Microsoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it's now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can't be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft's improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft's efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance... 

It's hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. 
The article acknowledges that both AMD and Intel "have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for..." But "Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia's GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025." And "Nvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025... Whatever happens to laptops in 2025, you can guarantee that there's going to be fierce competition between Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm." 

But the author still complains about the dedicated Copilot key on his new WIndows-on-Arm laptop. "While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it's still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<h2 id="32tasks">3.2. Tasks</h2>
<p>The complete set of NLPre tasks was originally curated for evaluating language systems in the CoNLL shared task 2018 (Zeman et al., 2018). These tasks mainly focus on preliminary text processing, such as tokenisation or divulging morphosyntactic features. We follow the CoNLL task choice and include all these tasks in NLPre-PL.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Segmentation</strong> A segmentation task consists in splitting texts into sentences (Sentences), orthographic tokens (Tokens), and syntactic words (Words), the latter being the basic units of morphosyntactic analysis. Segmentation is not a trivial task. In some languages, an orthographic token may be recognised as a multi-word token (multiword for short) combining multiple syntactic words, e.g. in Polish, the token spalibyśmy (Eng. we would sleep) consists of the past participle spali (Eng. slept), the conditional marker by (Eng. would) and the mobile inflection śmy. Since the consistent model of segmentation into words and sentences was used in NKJP1M and PDB-UD, we maintain this data segmentation in NLPre-PL. It is also worth mentioning that the CoNLL format (but not TEI and DAG) allows for annotating orthographic tokens; thus, they are included in the NLPre-PL benchmark.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Tagging</strong> A tagging task is the process of identifying parts of speech (i.e. POS tagging) and possibly morphological features (i.e. morphological analysis) of words. It follows a predefined POS tagset. As mentioned in Section 3.1, two tagsets are used in the NLPre-PL datasets: Morfeusz and UD.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Lemmatisation</strong> Lemmatisation involves predicting canonical forms of syntactic words. Canonical forms are conventionally established identifiers of lexemes (i.e. sets of inflectionally related syntactic words). Since Polish is a fusional language with a large number of inflected words, lemmatisation is an important task, albeit not trivial, e.g. the lemma of kluczy can be either the infinitive kluczyć (Eng. to weave) or the noun klucz (Eng. a key).</p>
<p>\
<strong>Dependency</strong> parsing Dependency parsing is the process of automatically predicting the syntactic structure of an input sentence. A dependency structure is a labelled directed tree with nodes corresponding to syntactic words and edges between these words specifying dependency relations.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ss8303t.png" alt="Table 1: Summary of source datasets (NKJP1M and PDB-UD) and NLPre-PL Datasets (in tokens). Explanations: POS – the part-of-speech tagset; DEP – the dependency schema; Avg. t/s – the average number of tokens per sentence" /></p>
<p>\
<strong>NKJP1M</strong> (Przepiórkowski et al., 2018) The NKJP1M subcorpus of the Polish National Corpus (Przepiórkowski et al., 2012) is manually annotated according to the NKJP tagset (Szałkiewicz and Przepiórkowski, 2012) and afterwards modified in line with the Morfeusz tagset (Woliński, 2019). This balanced subset of thematic- and genre-diverse texts and transcriptions is used to train Polish POS taggers. NKJP1M is maintained in two formats: TEI[8] and DAG.[9] These two formats are accepted by older NLPre tools but not modern ones. We thus convert NKJP1M to the CoNLL-X format (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) preserving the original segmentation, POS tags and morphological features (i.e. the Morfeusz tagset), and to the CoNLL-U format10 with UD tags, Morfeusz tags (XPOS) and UD morphological features.</p>
<p>\
Since there is no generally accepted split of NKJP1M into training, development and testing subsets, we uniformly divide NKJP1M in all formats (i.e. DAG, TEI, CoNLL-X and CoNLL-U) pursuant to the formulated splitting heuristics. Each document in the subcorpus contains multiple paragraphs of continuous textual data. To avoid possible information leakage, we treat each such paragraph as an indivisible unit. To ensure that the subsets include paragraphs of varying length, we investigate the distribution over the number of segments in each paragraph. Since it is akin to Gaussian distribution, we decide to not exclude any data, and we divide the paragraphs into K = 10 buckets of roughly similar size and then sample from them with respective ratios of 0.8:0.1:0.1 (corresponding to train, dev, and test subsets). This data selection technique assures similar distribution of segments number per paragraph in three subsets, hereafter byName. For creating our second split, hereafter byType, we consider the type of document a paragraph belongs to. We first group paragraphs into categories equal to the document types, and then we repeat the above-mentioned procedure per category (see the summary of NKJP1M and data splits in Table 1). <strong>PDB-UD</strong> (Wróblewska, 2018) Polish Dependency Bank is the largest collection of Polish sentences manually annotated with dependency trees and afterwards converted into UD representations in line with the UD annotation schema (de Marneffe et al., 2021). PDB-UD slightly correlates with NKJP1M, i.e., a subset of the PDB-UD sentences comes from NKJP1M, and the language-specific tags (XPOS) in PDB-UD match the Morfeusz tagset. PDB-UD is typically used to train NLPre systems for Polish. In NLPre-PL, we use the original PDB-UD data without any modifications and its standard split (see the statistical summary of PDB-UD in Table 1).</p>

<h2 id="23configuration">2.3. Configuration</h2>
<p>We acknowledge the need to configure similar evaluation environments for other languages to promote linguistic diversity within the worldwide NLP community and to support local NLP communities working on a particular language. To ensure that, we publish a .yaml file that enables easy management of datasets, tagset, and metrics included in the benchmark. The content of all subpages can be modified using a WYSIWYG editor within the application. This setting ensures quite a low entry level for setting up the platform, with minimal changes required.</p>
<p>\
As a standard feature, we include pre-defined descriptions for the prevalent NLPre tasks. Those can be modified via either configuration files or the administrator panel. Additionally, we supply a default evaluation script, but users are free to provide their own customised code.</p>
<p>\
To show the capabilities of the benchmarking system, we set up a prototype for Polish (Figure 1). NLPre-PL is described in detail in Section 3. To support our claim that the system is language agnostic, we set up NLPre-GA for Irish and NLPreZH for Chinese. The choice of those languages is not arbitrary; our objective is to demonstrate the capability of the platform in evaluating diverse languages, including those based on non-Latin scripts. In setting up said benchmarking systems we use existing UDv2.9 treebanks: UD<em>Chinese-GSD (Shen et al., 2019) and UD</em>Irish-IDT (Lynn et al., 2015) and available up-to-date models, trained on these treebanks. The selection of models mirrors the criteria applied in this work regarding the evaluation of Polish, that is: COMBO, Stanza, SpaCy, UDPipe, and Trankit. If the specific model is not available for UDv2.9, we train it from scratch on the datasets linked above.</p>

<h2 id="22onlinebenchmarkingsystem">2.2. Online benchmarking system</h2>
<p>The benchmarking system comprises three main parts: a data repository, a submission and evaluation system, and a leaderboard. The data repository provides descriptions of NLPre tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics, as well as links to the datasets.</p>
<p>\
The model submission and evaluation system allows the researchers to evaluate a new model by submitting its predictions for the test sets of raw sentences. It is mandatory to upload predictions for all provided test sets for a given tagset; however, it is possible to participate in an evaluation for only one tagset and only for a selected range of tasks.</p>
<p>\
The leaderboard is a tabular display of the performance of all submissions with their results for each dataset and tagset. The results for the evaluated model and its rank are displayed in the leaderboard provided the submitter confirms their publication.</p>
<p>\
The benchmarking system is implemented as a web-based application in Python using Django framework. This framework allows quite an easy implementation of MVC design pattern. Moreover, it offers access to the administrator panel, which can be very useful in the custom configuration of the benchmark. The submission scores are stored in a local SQLite database and the submissions are stored in .zip files in a designated directory. The results from the leaderboard are conveniently accessible via an API.</p>

<h2 id="2nlprebenchmarking">2. NLPre benchmarking</h2>
<h3 id="21researchconcept">2.1. Research concept</h3>
<p>In this study, we introduce a novel adaptation of the benchmarking approach to NLPre. The primary objective is to establish an automated and credible method for evaluating NLPre systems against a provided benchmark and continuously updating their performance ranking on a publicly accessible scoreboard. More specifically, predictions for the benchmark test sets output by NLPre systems and 5 https://nlpre-pl.clarin-pl.eu 6 https://nlpre-zh.clarin-pl.eu 7 https://nlpre-ga.clarin-pl.eu submitted to the benchmarking system are automatically compared against the publicly undisclosed reference dataset. This method effectively prevents result manipulation and ensures fairness of the final assessment. The second important methodological assumption is to enable the ongoing evaluation of new or upgraded NLPre systems to guarantee up-to-date and complete ranking. Consequently, the leaderboard can serve as a reliable point of reference for NLPre system developers.</p>
<p>\
Based on these assumptions, we design and implement the language-centric and tagset-agnostic benchmarking system that enables comprehensive and credible evaluation, constitutes an up-to-date source of information on NLPre progress, and is fully configurable to facilitate building benchmarking systems for multiple languages.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>With the advancements of transformer-based architectures, we observe the rise of natural language preprocessing (NLPre) tools capable of solving preliminary NLP tasks (e.g. tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, or morphological analysis) without any external linguistic guidance. It is arduous to compare novel solutions to well-entrenched preprocessing toolkits, relying on rule-based morphological analysers or dictionaries. Aware of the shortcomings of existing NLPre evaluation approaches, we investigate a novel method of reliable and fair evaluation and performance reporting. Inspired by the GLUE benchmark, the proposed language-centric benchmarking system enables comprehensive ongoing evaluation of multiple NLPre tools, while credibly tracking their performance. The prototype application is configured for Polish and integrated with the thoroughly assembled NLPre-PL benchmark. Based on this benchmark, we conduct an extensive evaluation of a variety of Polish NLPre systems. To facilitate the construction of benchmarking environments for other languages, e.g. NLPre-GA for Irish or NLPre-ZH for Chinese, we ensure full customization of the publicly released source code of the benchmarking system. The links to all the resources (deployed platforms, source code, trained models, datasets etc.) can be found on the project website: https://sites.google.com/view/nlpre-benchmark.</p>

<strong>Keywords</strong>: benchmarking, leaderboard, segmentation, POS tagging, dependency parsing, Polish</p>
<h2 id="1introductionandrelatedworks">1. Introduction and related works</h2>
<p>Morphosyntactic features predicted by part-ofspeech (POS) taggers and dependency parsers underlie various downstream tasks, including but not limited to sentiment analysis (Sun et al., 2019), relation extraction (Zhang et al., 2018; Vashishth et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2019), semantic role labelling (Wang et al., 2019; Kasai et al., 2019), question answering (Khashabi et al., 2018), or machine translation (Chen et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). These underlying tasks may therefore be referred to as natural language preprocessing (NLPre) tasks, as they precede the advanced NLP tasks. Since the quality of morphosyntactic predictions has a crucial impact on the performance of downstream tasks (Sachan et al., 2021), it is prudent to employ the best existing NLPre tools to predict the proper linguistic features. We are equipped with various NLPre methods, ranging from rule-based tools with hand-crafted grammars (e.g. Crouch et al., 2011), through statistical systems (e.g. Nivre, 2009; McDonald et al., 2005; Straka et al., 2016), neural systems supported by pre-trained language models (e.g. Qi et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021a) to large language models (LLM Ouyang et al., 2022).</p>
<p>\
In the context of intrinsically evaluating NLPre tools and reporting their performance, a variety of approaches have been proposed, e.g. shared task, performance table, and progress repository. The main goal of a shared task is to comprehensively evaluate participating systems on the released datasets using the carefully defined evaluation methodology. Numerous NLPre shared tasks have been organised so far (e.g. Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Seddah et al., 2013; Zeman et al., 2017, 2018), and they undoubtedly boosted the development of NLPre. While widely favoured, shared tasks are questionable as a complete and up-todate source of knowledge about NLPre progress. First, they scrutinise only solutions propounded in the current contest and do not include systems participating in the previous editions or possible future ones. Second, as shared tasks are organised sporadically, their results are not revised and may quickly become outdated. Certainly, the datasets released for shared tasks can be reused in experiments involving novel tools. The results of such experiments can be reported in independent scientific publications. Nonetheless, these publications are widely scattered, lacking a centralised platform for systematically tracking the ongoing NLPre progress with respect to a particular language.</p>
<p>\
The results of a new or upgraded NLPre tool are typically reported in performance tables (e.g. Stanza[1] or Trankit[2]). Such tables provide information about the quality of the tool in preprocessing a set of languages. The performance tables, however, often lack comparison with other systems trained for these particular languages. Additionally, as NL Pre systems may be trained on different dataset releases (e.g. of Universal Dependencies), comparing their performance tables is not conclusive.</p>
<p>\

<p>\
Information about trends and progress in NLP research is usually collected in public repositories such as Papers with Code[3] or NLP-progress[4]. These repositories contain a repertoire of datasets for common NLP tasks, e.g. dependency parsing and POS tagging, and rankings of models trained and tested on these datasets. They are open to contributing new datasets and results, which, to ensure their credibility, originate from published and linked scientific papers. However, cutting-edge yet unpublished results of a new or upgraded NLPre system are not eligible to report. NLPre tasks are accompanied by datasets mostly in English, raising the problem of language unrepresentation of the repositories. Last but not least, the Papers with Code repository is prone to abuse. After logging in, one can add new results and link them with irrelevant papers as well as edit existing results. The fraudulent results are publicised immediately.</p>
<p>\
Despite yielding valuable information about the progress in NLPre, the mentioned evaluation approaches also reveal shortcomings, e.g. outdated and incomplete outcomes, lack of cross-system comparison, disregarding some systems, risk of result manipulation and absence of a language-centring perspective.</p>
<p>\
Following standard procedures in NLP research, we propose to robustly and fairly evaluate NLPre tools using the benchmarking method that allows for the evaluation of NLP models’ performance and progress. NLP benchmarks are coupled with leaderboards that report and update model performance on the benchmark tasks, e.g. GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), XTREME (Hu et al., 2020), GEM (Gehrmann et al., 2021). The conventional benchmarking approach may be dynamically enhanced, exemplified by the Dynabench platform (Kiela et al., 2021), which enables users to augment the benchmark data by inputting custom examples. This humanand-model-in-the-loop benchmarking scenario appears promising for NLU tasks. Nevertheless, it may not be effective in the case of NLPre, as annotating credible examples of syntactic trees or morphological features requires expert knowledge. Finding multiple experts among casual users can be a serious obstacle, we thus implement our system in tune with the standard benchmarking method.</p>
<p>\
To our knowledge, benchmarking hasn’t been used to rank NLPre systems, even if it is valuable and desired by the community creating treebanks or designing advanced NLP pipelines. Our NLPre benchmarking approach fills this gap. The proposed online benchmarking system automatically assesses submitted predictions of NLPre systems and publishes their performance ranking on a public scoreboard (see Section 2.2). The system is language-centric and tagset-agnostic, enables comprehensive and credible evaluation and constitutes an up-to-date source of information on NLPre progress for a particular language. Unlike similar platforms, e.g. Codalab (Pavao et al., 2022), the NLPre benchmarking system is fully configurable and easy to set up, allowing users to establish an evaluation environment for any language. Additionally, it can be self-hosted, making it convenient for developers and researchers working with a particular language to have it accessible on a local server.</p>
<p>\
To justify the use of the benchmarking technique for NLPre tasks, we conduct empirical research in a challenging scenario with Polish as an example language. In the case of Polish, one dominant hurdle arises – the discrepancies between different tagsets, annotation schemes and datasets utilised for training disparate systems preclude their direct comparison. We thus standardise the training and evaluation of NLPre systems on a new performance benchmark for Polish, hereafter NLPre-PL (see Section 3). It consists of a predefined set of NLPre tasks and reformulated versions of existing Polish datasets. Section 4 outlines our robust and reliable evaluation of the selected NLPre systems on the NLPre-PL benchmark. According to our knowledge, no evaluation experiments have been carried out in Polish to compare the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs, neural NLPre systems and established tagging disambiguators due to the lack of a coherent evaluation environment.</p>
<p>\
This work makes a tripartite contribution encompassing novelty, research, and development underpinned by an open-source ethos. (1) We propose a novel language-oriented benchmarking approach to evaluate and rank NLPre systems. (2) We conduct a scientific evaluation of the proposed approach in the non-trivial Polish language scenario on the assembled NLPre-PL benchmark. (3) We publish online benchmarking platforms for three distinct languages: Polish[5], Chinese[6], and Irish[7], and release the benchmarking system’s source code as open-source.</p>

AI tools could be used to manipulate online audiences into making decisions &mdash; ranging from what to buy to who to vote for &mdash; according to researchers at the University of Cambridge. The paper highlights an emerging new marketplace for "digital signals of intent" &mdash; known as the "intention economy" &mdash; where AI assistants understand, forecast and manipulate human intentions and sell that information on to companies who can profit from it. The intention economy is touted by researchers at Cambridge's Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI) as a successor to the attention economy, where social networks keep users hooked on their platforms and serve them adverts. The intention economy involves AI-savvy tech companies selling what they know about your motivations, from plans for a stay in a hotel to opinions on a political candidate, to the highest bidder... 

The study claims that large language models (LLMs), the technology that underpins AI tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot, will be used to "anticipate and steer" users based on "intentional, behavioural and psychological data"... Advertisers will be able to use generative AI tools to create bespoke online ads, the report claims... AI models will be able to tweak their outputs in response to "streams of incoming user-generated data", the study added, citing research showing that models can infer personal information through workaday exchanges and even "steer" conversations in order to gain more personal information. 
The article includes this quote from Dr. Jonnie Penn, an historian of technology at LCFI. "Unless regulated, the intention economy will treat your motivations as the new currency. It will be a gold rush for those who target, steer and sell human intentions. 
"We should start to consider the likely impact such a marketplace would have on human aspirations, including free and fair elections, a free press and fair market competition, before we become victims of its unintended consequences."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Born in 1924, he had just celebrated his 100th birthday on October 1st.


If you want to catch a glimpse of his political charisma, YouTube has a clip of Carter's appearance on "What's My Line" when he was still only governor of Georgia. Within five years he'd be president of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981. 

But it seems like today everyone has a story to tell. More than two decades later, long-time Slashdot reader destinyland saw Jimmy Carter speak in Las Vegas in 2001 on the final day of the CTIA Wireless tradeshow. "I feel thrilled to be a part of this," 77-year-old Carter had said....

Carter applauded the work of "entrepreneurs and scientists and engineers that are transforming the face of the globe." And he noted their technologies could address problems targeted by the Carter Center. 

Interrupted by a few cellphone rings, the former President conversed on a stage at the Sands Expo and Venetian Hotel with Tom Wheeler, the president of the wireless communications trade association. Wheeler reminded the audience of Carter's decidedly nontechnical background, discussing An Hour Before Daylight, Carter's memoir about growing up on a farm in Georgia during the Great Depression. "We were the only family blessed with an outhouse," Carter told the crowd. 

 Wheeler also asked a question many in the technology community could relate to. Carter, he pointed out, had been involuntarily retired. "What's it feel like?" The former President told the audience he'd re-focussed his energies into humanitarian efforts through the Carter Center, which is active in providing health services around the world as well as monitoring elections. Carter donated his appearance fee to the Carter Center... 

 Midway through the hour-long discussion, the former President touted his administration's record of deregulating several industries, including transportation, energy, and communications, saying "If it hadn't been for that deregulation, this environment in which you all live wouldn't have been possible." Carter also shared with the business crowd that it was a belief in free enterprise that made him want to enter politics, drawn from his experiences selling peanuts as a young boy for a dollar a day. 

The audience greeted the former president warmly, giving him a standing ovation both when he took the stage and when he left. Carter joked it was almost enough to make him want to get back into politics. 

Everyone has their own opinion. When a friend of mine was in high school, she got to meet Jimmy Carter early in his presidency. He'd seemed unusually kind and good, she said, but remembered her first reaction. "They're going to eat you alive." And yet then, pointing to the humanitarian work he would continue for four decades, she said he was also clearly America's very best ex-president. 

And the liberal blog Talking Points Memo argues Carter's accomplishments as president are being re-evaluated:
Some found him to be distinctly unsung, with little attention given to his brokering of peace with the Camp David Accords and emphasis on global human rights. And some just liked him. A serious, intelligent, faithful, deeply honest man who spurned political expediency and burned through hundreds of pages of memos a day, he preached self-restraint, stewardship and commonality to an electorate that cast him off four years later for the glib excesses of Ronald Reagan.... "People assume that because he wasn't warm and cuddly with Congress that he didn't get much through," said John Alter [who wrote the first independent Carter biography in 2020]. "He signed more legislation in four years than Clinton or Obama did in eight. He has the most prodigious legislative record since World War II, with the exception of Lyndon Johnson." 

That record includes, by Alter's count, 14 major pieces of environmental legislation. In one of Carter's more creative moves, he dusted off the 1906 Antiquities Act to keep pristine 56 million acres of Alaskan wilderness. His piecemeal approach, cloaked in distinctly unsexy bills like the 1978 Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act, planted the seeds for a changing national energy system in the face of climate change. Carter had started underlining passages in scientific journals about what is now the most existential crisis of our time as early as 1971. What's most wrenching about Carter's improvements in energy and environmental policy now is what he wasn't able to accomplish. On his way out of office, he issued a report that included recommendations for cutting carbon emissions &mdash; at exactly the same rate the Paris Climate Accords coalesced behind 35 years later.... 

His Carter Center has virtually eradicated certain devastating diseases on the African continent, part of the work for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. He and Rosalynn have also helped build and repair over 4,000 homes for Habitat for Humanity, work that continued well into his 90s. 



I've got my own story. As a young boy I saw Jimmy Carter give a speech in 1977 &mdash; just six months after he'd assumed the presidency. A crowd of teenagers thrilled to see the president gave him a long, loud round of applause. And when it finally died down, Carter said... 

"I wish I got that kind of reception from Congress."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Here's the list of 2024's top-grossing films published by the movie blog SlashFilm: 

10. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice 
9. Venom: The Last Dance
8. Kung Fu Panda 4
7. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire 
6. Wicked
5. Dune: Part Two 
4. Moana 2
3. Despicable Me 4
2. Deadpool &amp; Wolverine 
1. Inside Out 2 

2024 was the year Godzilla celebrated its 70th year as a franchise &mdash; but it wasn't the only long-running franchise. "When the Marvel Cinematic Universe went R-rated with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine... it was literally more successful than any other R-rated movie in history," SlashFilm points out, while Venom: The Last Dance was the year's 9th highest-earner. (But several other big superhero movies flopped and "the misses outweighed the hits this year, while DC sat it out entirely as the world waits for Superman to usher in James Gunn's new DC Universe.") 

They also marvel that Wicked earned $572 million after opening on the same day as Ridley Scott's Gladiator II.... 

But in the end SlashFilm describes 2024 as "a banner year for animation," with computer-animated movies filling four of the top ten spots (Kung Fu Panda 4, Moana 2, Despicable Me 4, and Inside Out 2). And another interesting trend? Though the world flocked to Tim Burton's first sequel to Beetlejuice after 36 years, Warner Bros. was, "at one point, pushing for Beetlejuice 2 to go directly to streaming on Max." And Disney original had the same idea for Moana 2, leading SlashFilm to conclude that 2024's box office "should be the death of the big direct-to-streaming movie." SlashFilm notes that Disney also sent several Pixar originals to Disney+ between 2020 and 2022, which "did immeasurable damage to the brand, something that even CEO Bob Iger has acknowledged." And then after a theatrical debut Pixar's Inside Out 2 became "the eighth biggest movie ever at the box office, with $1.698 billion to its name" &mdash; and the highest-grossing animated film ever made. 


And Dune: Part Two?

Denis Villeneuve accomplished nothing shy of a miracle with 2021's "Dune," an adaptation of Frank Herbert's cherished sci-fi novel that was faithful to the material, massive in scale, but still felt like an auteur film... The only downside? 2021 was a terrible time to release a movie, particularly a Warner Bros. movie, as all of the studio's films were going to HBO Max the same day they hit theaters. Yet, "Dune" made $400 million in its original run, which was enough to justify a sequel. Evidently, the audience for this franchise grew exponentially in the years before "Dune: Part Two" hit theaters in early March... All told, Villeneuve's sweeping, epic sequel pulled in $714.4 million worldwide, all while garnering tons of acclaim once again. Also, not for nothing, Villeneuve got it made for less than $200 million... 


Without "Dune: Part Two" making what it made, the box office might have been in truly dire shape. As a relatively dead April and very weak May followed, this overperformance helped keep theaters afloat until greener pastures arrived in the back half of the year. The Spice must flow, as it were. 


 The Hollywood Reporter offers another take on the significance of 2024:

Total domestic box office revenue appears to be heading toward around $8 billion, down from 2023's exhilarating post-COVID turnaround of $9 billion, but the National Association of Theatre Owners prefers to accentuate the positive, attributing the dip to a shortage of product due to the labor strikes and taking encouragement from the renewal of the movie habit... 

Interestingly, or thankfully, the cinematic universes of Marvel, DC, and Star Wars failed to expand: except for Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, not one of the huge hits came from a comic book franchise or a galaxy far, far away. 
The article then complains about people using their phones during the movie for texting, talking, and photographing the movie itself. (Though it applauds a PSA against the practice in which Deadpool and Wolverine "delivered the message in laudably blunt terms.") 
And on Wikipedia, Deadpool &amp; Wolverine and Dune: Part Two were the eighth and 23rd most popular articles of 2024.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

In a post on X, the Carter Center said that Jimmy Carter died peacefully, surrounded by his family. The former US president governed amid Cold War pressures, turbulent oil markets and social upheaval over racism, women's rights and America's global role. 

His achievements in office included brokering a landmark peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1978 known as the Camp David Accords. For that he would later win the Nobel Peace Prize. That Camp David experience inspired the post-presidential center where Carter would establish so much of his legacy, largely shaped by his work after leaving the presidency in 1981. 

He was the first US president to live to be a 100 years old.

The rich get richer &mdash; and older. People with high salaries and net worth tend to live longer lives, research shows. Once Americans make it to their late 50s, the wealthiest 10% live to a median age of around 86 years, roughly 14 years longer than the least wealthy 10%, according to a study published earlier this year in JAMA Internal Medicine. People with more money can afford healthier food, more healthcare and homes in safer, less-polluted neighborhoods, says Kathryn Himmelstein, a co-author of the study and a medical director at the Boston Public Health Commission. 

Though you can't add more months or years to your online shopping cart yet, health and aging researchers say there are ways to spend money to improve your chances of living longer. They suggest favoring purchases that help you track your health, stay active and reduce stress. "We know the things that help us age better, and everyone's always disappointed when you tell them," says Andrew Scott, director of economics at the Ellison Institute of Technology in Oxford, England. "Eat less and eat better, sleep more, exercise more and spend time with friends...." But certain gadgets and luxuries can be worth the cost, some researchers say. Devices such as the Apple Watch and Oura Ring can instill healthy habits and catch worrying patterns that might emerge between annual checkups, says Joe Coughlin, the director of the MIT AgeLab... Coughlin says he once went to the emergency room because his Apple Watch detected a spike in his heart rate that he hadn't noticed himself. 

"For the superwealthy, suddenly living longer and living better has become the new prestige," Coughlin says. Higher incomes correlate with longer lives, but there are diminishing returns. Each successive jump in pay is linked to smaller boosts in longevity, a 2016 study from the research group Opportunity Insights found... A key to the relationship between income and longevity is that money doesn't just buy stuff that helps you live longer. It also buys time and reduces stress. "If you've got a nice place to live and you don't have to worry about food on the table, you have the mental head space and resources to prioritize your health," says Steven Woolf, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine... Moreover, many lower-income jobs are more physically taxing and more prone to workplace accidents and exposure to harmful substances. 

The article also includes examples of spending that promotes health, including things like home gym equipment and even swing-dancing lessons. 
But it also adds that "plenty of things that are good for you don't come with a bill, such as going on a walk or minimizing screen time before bedtime."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>Bias is commonly identified in medical image analysis applications [38,40]. For instance [6], a CNN trained on brain MRI resulted in a significant difference between ethnicities. Seyyed-Kalantari et al. [32] observed that minorities received higher rates of algorithmic underdiagnosis. Zong et al. [40] assessed bias mitigation algorithms inand out-of-distribution settings. The experiments demonstrated the wide existence of bias in AI-based medical imaging classifiers and none of the bias mitigation algorithms was able to prevent this.</p>
<p>\
Different definitions of fairness are used:</p>
<p>\
– <strong>Individual fairness</strong> [25] requires that similar individuals should be treated equally and thus have similar predictions. For example, a model should have comparable diagnosis on two similar X-Ray images. </p>
<p>\
– <strong>Group fairness</strong> requires equal performance on sub-groups divided based on sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex, and age). Common group fairness metrics are demographic parity [8], equal odds [12] and predictive rate parity or sufficiency [21]. </p>
<p>\
– <strong>Minimax fairness</strong> [5] seeks to ensure that the worst-off group is treated as fairly as possible, reducing the most severe negative impacts of a decision or system.</p>
<p>\
These definitions have pros and cons [36]. Individual fairness relies on the choice of the distance metric, which requires expert input. In minimax fairness, the ideal solution is difficult to compute and the degree of unfairness relies heavily on the choice of the set of models. Group fairness metrics are easy to implement and understand, but are not always adapted to the problem nor compatible with one another [2,18]. And even though prior work has broadened the group fairness notion by adding other normative choices than strict equality [1], none of the proposed metrics prevent the harm that could be brought to each subgroup’s performance individually or to the whole population’s benefit.</p>
<p>\
As mentioned in the introduction, similarly to [24,34,27,26], we believe that medical AI is different from other domains in that each improvement can save lives. Therefore, increasing disparities to achieve the best performance possible for each demographic subgroup and for the population as a whole could be justified. Previous research has shown that images themselves could carry demographic encodings [10,9]. E.g., Yang et al. [39] investigate the utilization of demographic encodings by analyzing the use of demographic shortcuts for disease classification. Two papers [41,11] examine the relevance of explicitly using sensitive attributes in fair classification systems for non-medical problems. They compare different models which leverage sensitive attributes with a model which is not trained on any sensitive attribute.</p>

But even in the event of a worst-case scenario, New York magazine believes "We may be more equipped for another pandemic than you think..."

In 2023, more than half of people surveyed said that their lives had not returned to normal since the COVID outbreak, and a surprising number &mdash; 47 percent &mdash; said they now believe their lives will never return to normal. 

But do we really know how a new pandemic would go and how we would handle it? Things are different this time &mdash; and in ways that aren't all bad. Unlike with COVID in the spring of 2020, millions of doses of bird-flu vaccines at various stages of testing sit in government stockpiles, and more are on the way. There are also already tests that work, though these are not broadly available to the public... Recent research suggests that we might actually manage a second pandemic better than we would believe. Despite all the noise to the contrary, a June poll by Harvard's School of Public Health says that Americans overall think the government responses to COVID &mdash; asking people to wear masks, pausing indoor dining, requiring health-care workers to get vaccinated &mdash; were all good ideas. Although the media tends to paint school closures as radically unpopular, only 44 percent of respondents said they currently think the shutdowns were a mistake. 

A growing body of research also suggests that many Americans feel stronger for what we endured during the most extreme days of COVID. Counter to what we like to say about our friends and neighbors and children, the challenge of the pandemic may have benefited some people's mental health. One study found that "children entering the pandemic with clinically meaningful mental-health problems experienced notable improvements in their mental health." (Turns out there's one thing worse than shutting down an American school and that's having to attend it.) 

The article also points out that "There is no real information" on the likelihood of a bird-flu virus even crossing over into humans. 

And of course, "COVID still kills, with a body count just shy of 50,000 Americans in 2024, and it feels like a stretch to say that Americans are particularly concerned."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<strong>Abstract</strong>. Fairness in medical AI is increasingly recognized as a crucial aspect of healthcare delivery. While most of the prior work done on fairness emphasizes the importance of equal performance, we argue that decreases in fairness can be either harmful or non-harmful, depending on the type of change and how sensitive attributes are used. To this end, we introduce the notion of positive-sum fairness, which states that an increase in performance that results in a larger group disparity is acceptable as long as it does not come at the cost of individual subgroup performance. This allows sensitive attributes correlated with the disease to be used to increase performance without compromising on fairness.</p>
<p>\
We illustrate this idea by comparing four CNN models that make di fferent use of the race attribute in the training phase. The results show that removing all demographic encodings from the images helps close the gap in performance between the different subgroups, whereas leveraging the race attribute as a model’s input increases the overall performance while widening the disparities between subgroups. These larger gaps are then put in perspective of the collective benefit through our notion of positive-sum fairness to distinguish harmful from non harmful disparities.</p>
<h2 id="1introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Medical imaging plays a critical role in diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring patient progress. However, the reliability of medical imaging algorithms is not uniformly distributed across different demographic groups, raising concerns about fairness and potential biases in the results. Fairness in medical imaging most often refers to the equitable treatment of patients from diverse demographic backgrounds, regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, or other characteristics sensitive to discrimination [19,38].</p>
<p>\
This equitable treatment is often interpreted as a similar performance across different demographic subgroups. When applied to domains like credit card scoring or AI-powered recruiting, ignoring all sensitive attributes and prioritizing a similar performance across the different demographic subgroups is an acceptable approach. However, in the medical field, demographic attributes are important clinical factors which radiologists and clinicians often take into consideration as they can have a strong impact on their diagnoses and can guide them to consider specific tests or treatments based on the patient’s demographic profile. The prevalence of diseases can be correlated to demographic attributes. For example, studies have shown that breast cancer has a higher incidence among Ashkenazi Jewish women [37,30]. And, due to historical and social disparities as well as different physiological features across demographic subgroups, the difficulty level of medical tasks is not uniformly distributed. For this reason, even collecting more or more diverse data does not necessarily produce equal performance across demographic subgroups as the best achievable result is not the same for each of them [27]. In a domain where each improvement can save lives, it is hard to disregard the benefit of the population as a whole for the sake of decreasing the disparities between subgroups.</p>
<p>\
Petersen et al. [26] examined various types of demographic invariance in medical imaging AI, highlighting why they can be undesirable and stressing the need for better fairness assessments and mitigation techniques in this field. Several fairness measures suffer from degradation in the overall performance by penalizing the performance of an AI system for groups that it performs better on, in order to achieve parity with groups it performs worse on, which is referred to as “levelling down” [24]. While we are aware of papers suggesting training methods which aim to maximize the benefit of each subgroup (Berk Ustun [34], for instance, suggested debiasing methods following the ethical principles of beneficence (“do the best”) and non-maleficence (“do not harm”) [35] in regards to fairness), and methods which improve fairness by understanding and mitigating the demographic encodings present in images [39,3], we could not find any fairness evaluation framework or definition which allows to compare different models from the prism of harmful and non harmful disparities.</p>
<p>\
We, therefore, introduce the notion of positive-sum fairness: when looking at a situation where we have an initial model and are looking at the trade-off between fairness and performance while trying to improve it, inequitable performance can be acceptable as long as it does not come at the expense of other subgroups and allows a higher overall performance to be achieved. Specifically, we argue that differences in performance can be harmful and non-harmful. We consider a disparity harmful if it comes at the cost of the overall performance or if improving the overall performance is achieved by decreasing performance on any protected subgroup. A difference in performance across protected subgroups is considered non-harmful if, by improving an AI system’s performance, we exacerbate the disparities between subgroups without negatively impacting any specific subgroup. This main idea is summarized in figure 1.</p>
<p>\
We compare the positive-sum fairness framework with a more traditional group fairness definition, which is the largest disparity in performance across subgroups. We show that some models, while increasing this disparity, actually improve the performance of each subgroup individually and that other models which decrease the disparity ("improving fairness" from a classic point of view) are harming some subgroups to achieve it.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-gz034p3.png" alt="Fig. 1: We investigate fairness of AI models and introduce the concept of ’positivesum fairness’ to differentiate harmful and non-harmful disparities. Graph a) shows the performance of an initial model per protected groups. b) shows the performance of an updated model with a higher overall performance but a lower fairness, under its standard definition, as indicated by the larger difference between the most and least advantaged groups and therefore could be rejected on the basis of fairness. c) shows the same updated model as b) however it shows the performance difference per group compared to the initial model. In this positive-sum framing we see that none of the groups had a reduction in performance and therefore the increased performance in Race C did not come at the cost of performance in any other group." /></p>

Finnish police said on Sunday they had found tracks that drag on for dozens of kilometres along the bottom of the Baltic Sea where a tanker carrying Russian oil is suspected of breaking a power line and four telecoms cables with its anchor... A break in the 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia occurred at midday on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking the two countries, grid operators said. They said Estlink 2 might not be back in service before August. 

In an interesting twist, the New York Times reports that the ship "bears all the hallmarks of vessels belonging to Russia's shadow fleet, officials said, and had embarked from a Russian port shortly before the cables were cut."

If confirmed, it would be the first known instance of a shadow fleet vessel being used to intentionally sabotage critical infrastructure in Europe &mdash; and, officials and experts said, a clear escalation by Russia in its conflict with the West... NATO's general secretary, Mark Rutte, responding to requests from the leaders of Finland and Estonia, both member nations, said the Atlantic alliance would "enhance" its military presence in the Baltic Sea... 

Since Russia began assembling its fleet, the number of shadow vessels traversing the oceans has grown by hundreds and now makes up 17 percent of the total global oil tanker fleet... Nearly 70 percent of Russia's oil is being transported by shadow tankers, according to an analysis published in October by the Kyiv School of Economics Institute, a research organization based in Ukraine... The authorities in Finland are still investigating whether the "Eagle S" engaged in a criminal act. But the sheer size of the shadow fleet might have made using some of these vessels for sabotage irresistible to Russia, [said Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who has researched and written about shadow fleets]... 

While it's still not certain that this week's cable cutting was done intentionally, the Baltic Sea, for a number of reasons, is an ideal arena to carry out sabotage operations. It is relatively shallow and is crisscrossed with essential undersea cables and pipelines that provide energy, as well as internet and phone services, to a number of European countries that are NATO members. Russia has relatively unfettered access to the sea from several ports, and its commercial vessels, protected by international maritime law, can move around international waters largely unmolested... The suspicions that Russia was using shadow vessels for more than just escaping sanctions existed before this week's cable cutting. Last April, the head of Sweden's Navy told a local news outlet that there was evidence such ships were being used to conduct signals intelligence on behalf of Russia and that some fishing vessels had been spotted with antennas and masts not normally seen on commercial vessels. Since the war began, there has also been an uptick in suspicious episodes resulting in damage to critical undersea infrastructure... 


Hours after Finland's energy grid operator alerted the police that an undersea power cable was damaged on Wednesday, Finnish officers descended by helicopter to the ship's deck and took over the bridge, preventing the vessel from sailing farther. By Friday, it remained at anchor in the Gulf of Finland, guarded by a Finnish Defense Forces missile boat and a Border Guard patrol vessel. 

The cable incident happened just weeks after the EU issued new sanctions targetting Russia's shadow fleet, Euronews reports. "A handful of Chinese companies suspected of enabling Russia's production of drones are also blacklisted as part of the agreement, a diplomat told Euronews."
The "shadow fleet" has been accused of deceptive practices, including transmitting falsified data and turning off their transporters to become invisible to satellite systems, and conducting multiple ship-to-ship transfers to conceal the origin of the oil barrels...<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The Clinton administration said that preparing the U.S. for Y2K was probably "the single largest technology management challenge in history." The bug threatened a cascade of potential disruptions &mdash; blackouts, medical equipment failures, banks shutting down, travel screeching to a halt &mdash; if the systems and software that helped keep society functioning no longer knew what year it was... Computer specialist and grassroots organizer Paloma O'Riley compared the scale and urgency of Y2K prep to telling somebody to change out a rivet on the Golden Gate Bridge. Changing out just one rivet is simple, but "if you suddenly tell this person he now has to change out all the rivets on the bridge and he has only 24 hours to do it in &mdash; that's a problem," O'Riley told reporter Jason Beaubien in 1998.... 

The date switchover rattled a swath of vital tech, including Wall Street trading systems, power plants and tools used in air traffic control. The Federal Aviation Administration put its systems through stress tests and mock scenarios as 2000 drew closer. "Twenty-three million lines of code in the air traffic control system did seem a little more daunting, I will say, than I had probably anticipated," FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told NPR in 1998. Ultimately there were no systemwide aviation breakdowns, but airlines were put on a Y2K alert.... 

Some financial analysts remained skeptical Y2K would come and go with minimal disruption. But by November 1999 the Federal Reserve said it was confident the U.S. economy would weather the big switch. "Federal banking agencies have been visited and inspected. Every bank in the United States, which includes probably 9,000 to 10,000 institutions, over 99% received a satisfactory rating," Fed Board Governor Edward Kelley said at the time. 

The article also remembers a California programmer who bought a mobile home, a propane generator, and a year's supply of dehydrated food. (They were also considering buying a handgun &mdash; and converting his bank savings into gold, silver, and cash.) And "Dozens of communities across the U.S. formed Y2K preparedness groups to stave off unnecessary panic..." 

But the article concludes that "the aggressive planning and recalibration paid off. Humanity passed into the year 2000 without pandemonium..." 

And "People like Jack Pentes of Charlotte, N.C., were left to figure out what to do with their emergency stockpiles."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<h2 id="5conclusionlimitationandfutureworks">5. Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Works</h2>
<p>We introduce LLaVA-Phi, a vision language assistant developed using the compact language model Phi-2. Our work demonstrates that such small vision-language models can perform effectively on standard benchmarks when combined with the LLaVA training methodology and a select dataset of high-quality data. The primary goal of our project is to aid the community in creating lightweight, multi-modal models capable of vision-language reasoning, optimized for operation on edge devices. This innovation paves the way for deploying multi-modal assistants in time-sensitive applications, such as robotics [35, 38].</p>
<p>\
<strong>Limitations.</strong> Given that Phi-2 utilizes the codegenmono [29] tokenizer and our model has not been specifically fine-tuned for following multilingual instructions, our LLaVA-Phi architecture is unable to process instructions in multiple languages, including Chinese.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Future Works.</strong> As language models have become significantly smaller in size compared to traditional vision-language models, they have become more accessible and affordable for the research community to explore fundamental concepts in vision-language integration. In future work, we plan to examine the impact of the size of the visual encoder and refine the training strategies for small language models, including approaches like direct preference optimization and RLHF, among other techniques. These efforts aim to further reduce model size while enhancing performance.</p>

But most of us don’t give much thought to how it all works—until it doesn’t. Whether it’s your Uber driver getting lost in a crowded urban area, your delivery package arriving late, or an autonomous vehicle encountering a signal disruption, the vulnerabilities of GPS are becoming clearer.</p>
<p>\
As we move toward a more connected and automated future, the limitations of GPS are not just an inconvenience; they’re a roadblock to progress. Luckily, a new wave of GPS alternatives is coming, and the impact will be felt by businesses, consumers, and investors alike.</p>
<p>\
<strong>GPS: CRITICAL BUT VULNERABLE</strong></p>
<p>GPS has served us well, but it has limitations. In both military and commercial applications, GPS signals are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and interference, leading to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. For everyday people, this could mean anything from a map taking you to the wrong location to a self-driving car losing its bearings in a tunnel. In dense urban environments, GPS struggles to provide the accuracy needed for precise navigation, especially when signals are blocked by tall buildings or adverse weather.</p>
<p>\
As we become more dependent on real-time location services in our daily lives—whether through ride-sharing apps, smart home deliveries, or even personal fitness tracking—these vulnerabilities can create real-world frustrations. And as businesses grow increasingly automated and logistics-driven, the stakes become even higher.</p>
<p>\
<strong>THE RISE OF GPS ALTERNATIVES</strong></p>
<p>The good news? The next generation of navigation technologies is emerging, offering more accurate, secure, and reliable alternatives to GPS. These technologies are not only set to transform industries but will also dramatically improve the consumer experience.</p>
<p>\
U.S. tech company AstraNav has invented a software-based method to provide devices and vehicles with precise location data without relying on GPS, internet, WiFi, or cellular signals. Their patented technology leverages the Earth’s own magnetic fields instead of satellite signals or network connectivity for navigation, tracking, and other location intelligence services. For consumers, this would give turn-by-turn directions indoors, underground, or in places where GPS signals are traditionally weak or non-existent. Imagine navigating a massive shopping mall or a subway system without losing your way because of poor GPS signals. Or, think about how your phone could guide you through multi-story buildings or crowded areas with pinpoint precision. Governments can also deploy a layer of secure, reliable location services as a backup to satellite constellations, which are notoriously vulnerable to jamming and spoofing.</p>
<p>\
Another exciting development comes from the world of quantum mechanics. Researchers at Imperial College London are working on the “quantum compass,” a navigation system that doesn’t rely on external signals. Using subatomic particles, this technology can determine location even in underground tunnels or underwater. This could revolutionize industries like mining, oil and gas, and urban infrastructure, but it also has massive implications for everyday users. Consumers could soon have devices that work flawlessly in environments where GPS fails—think deep in a subway system or a rural area far from cell towers.</p>
<p>\
Then there’s Xona Space Systems, which is developing a satellite constellation known as Pulsar©. This system aims to provide centimeter-level accuracy, far exceeding what GPS can offer today. For consumers and businesses alike, this level of accuracy will have immediate benefits. Think about the rise of autonomous delivery drones or driverless taxis—these services will depend on near-perfect geolocation to operate safely and efficiently. The Pulsar system could ensure that your next grocery delivery arrives at your doorstep with precision, no matter how dense or remote your neighborhood may be.</p>
<p>\
<strong>WHY IT MATTERS FOR CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES, AND INVESTORS</strong></p>
<p>What’s exciting about these developments is that they’re not just about improving navigation for businesses—they represent a critical shift in how companies can secure their operations and ensure business continuity. As a business leader, it’s essential to understand that this isn’t just about benefits; it’s about staying ahead of potential disruptions and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>\
As our reliance on location-based services grows—with applications in autonomous vehicles, drone deliveries, and smart cities—the risks associated with outdated GPS systems are also rising. What happens if your logistics operations face interference, or your autonomous systems lose accuracy due to signal jamming? Emerging alternatives provide new layers of security, precision, and reliability.</p>
<p>\
To prepare, business leaders need to start by reassessing their current dependencies on GPS and similar systems. Here’s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Invest In Resilient Navigation Technologies</strong>: Look into alternatives like M-GPS®, quantum navigation, or advanced satellite systems that offer more reliable and secure services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conduct Risk Assessments</strong>: Evaluate the vulnerabilities in your current operations tied to GPS and location-based services, especially in environments prone to signal disruption.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diversify Your Navigation Infrastructure</strong>: Ensure you have backup systems in place that can handle failures or disruptions in traditional GPS.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaborate With Tech Providers</strong>: Stay in close contact with providers of these emerging technologies to ensure you’re integrating the latest advancements as they become available.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By taking proactive steps today, businesses can ensure they’re not just reacting to changes in navigation technologies but leading with solutions that secure their future operations.</p>
<p>\
<strong>A NEW ERA IN NAVIGATION</strong></p>
<p>The next decade will witness a radical transformation in how we navigate both the physical and digital worlds. For businesses, consumers, and investors, now is the time to start paying attention to these emerging technologies. The companies developing GPS alternatives like M-GPS® and quantum compasses will shape the future of location services and geospatial technology.</p>

<h2 id="32qualitativeresults">3.2. Qualitative Results</h2>
<p>We present several examples that demonstrate the remarkable generalization capabilities of LLaVA-Phi, comparing its outputs with those of the LLaVA-1.5-13B models. In Figure 1, a meme is displayed, and we ask the visionlanguage assistant to explain why this meme is considered humorous. While LLaVA-1.5-13B provides a reasonable interpretation based on the image, LLaVA-Phi’s response is more empathetic, highlighting the humor by associating the dog’s ’laid-back demeanor’ with the ’stress or fatigue’ typically associated with a ’new workweek’.</p>
<p>\
In the second example, we instructed the model to generate Python code for converting an Excel table into a bar chart, as illustrated in Figure 2. LLaVA-1.5-13B generated a simplistic code snippet that only reads the table and prints it, diverging from the instructions to create a plot. In contrast, LLaVA-Phi accurately comprehended the task, providing instructions to read the table, add a title and labels, and correctly plot the bar chart using matplotlib. We believe this enhanced code generation capability stems from Phi-2, which was pre-trained on a large corpus of code snippets and is primarily used for code generation.</p>
<p>\
The third challenge involves solving a simple math problem, requiring the model to accurately recognize text through OCR and then perform the necessary mathematical computations, as shown in Figure 3. LLaVA-1.5-13B, while providing a step-by-step computation based on the image, incorrectly recognized the numbers and mathematical symbols. In contrast, our proposed LLaVA-Phi, without providing a chain-of-thought reasoning, still produces the correct answer. Our quantitative results on ScienceQA further confirm that LLaVA-Phi excels in these types of questionanswering tasks.</p>

Dr. Saifedean Ammous has authored the most read Bitcoin book in the world - <strong>The Bitcoin Standard</strong>.</p>
<p>\
Now, he is preparing to unleash his dragons onto the fictional scene with <strong>The Gold Standard</strong>.</p>
<p>\
For more information about this next book, check out his <a href="https://x.com/saifedean/status/1866463783385755677">tweet</a>. He provides the first 4 chapters free at his website and the book is available for pre-order, to be availed in March 2025.</p>
<p>\
But March 2025 is too far away for me :sweat_smile:.</p>
<p>\
So here I go, pitting BTC against BTC.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="1thepollutionproblem">1. The Pollution Problem</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/EHUYZRLLAUbgArGtd43kEIxTOTS2-fr03m2d.jpeg" alt="Aeroplanes polluting a high-tech BTC city" /></p>
<p>\
\
I’ll start right off the bat by stating the obvious.</p>
<p>\
The Blériot Transportation Company (BTC) and its Aeroplane Revolution, will quickly pollute the world at levels that would dwarf the factory pollution of Britain in its 19th century Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>\
At peak Aeroplane Revolution, I cannot fathom the noise, especially in very busy capital-clearing areas.</p>
<p>\
Today, <a href="https://www.oag.com/airline-frequency-and-capacity-statistics">more than 100,000 flights</a> are taken every day. Considering an average of 100 passengers per flight, more than 10 million people are flying every day.</p>
<p>But that is all in our imperfect fiat world.</p>
<p>\
How about if we also had gold clearance services by a 100-year-old BTC system, running concurrently?</p>
<p>\
Well, people perform payments more frequently than they do flights, so there would be more than 100,000 <em>golden flights</em> happening daily as well.</p>
<p>Granted. I would be happier and wealthier.</p>
<p>But would those planes be so good for our climate problems and respiratory health?</p>
<p>I don’t think so.</p>
<p>\
And in the unlikely event of a golden plane crash, gold bars falling from the sky add complications to the entire debacle. </p>
<p>Also, some crazy person would be motivated to shoot one of these golden birds down.</p>
<p>\
If Satoshi ever surfaced to challenge that BTC system, inviting it to upgrade to Bitcoin, I believe he would be welcomed with open arms.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is highly energy efficient compared to the Blériot Transportation Company. With next to no pollution. Nor sleep lost over whether any pirate will shoot the plane down.</p>
<p>Bitcoin keys, which is all you need, are always safe on a piece of paper in the drawer.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="2nexttonoscammers">2. Next to no Scammers</h2>
<p>\
I’ll give this to the world of the Blériot Transportation Company. I really do not see how scammers, with keyboard-warrior fingers and only underwear, would rob any self-dignified man or woman of their BTC gold.</p>
<p>\
That world would have more tough hombres. Men and Women alike.</p>
<p>\
Here’s the thing about gold: it inspires confidence in a way that comparative digital wealth does not.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what all the pirate stories I have read tell me.</p>
<p>Even the term ‘Spanish Conquistador’ has a fierceness that ‘Bitcoin Maximalist’ just doesn’t match.</p>
<p>\
To seal this deal, look at all these movie titles on gold:</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/EHUYZRLLAUbgArGtd43kEIxTOTS2-7q13mq6.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>All created in a world <em>without</em> the Blériot Transportation Company.</p>
<p>\
Now look at movies about bitcoin, crypto and digital money.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/EHUYZRLLAUbgArGtd43kEIxTOTS2-3223mwq.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
3 search terms, but still, not much could be found.</p>
<p>\
I guess that settles it.</p>
<p>\
You also won’t get the below muscle mass if all your wealth can easily be carried around on a flash drive.</p>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/EHUYZRLLAUbgArGtd43kEIxTOTS2-id33mva.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On a BTC gold standard, we would definitely be back on the moon by now.</p>
<p>\
With some gold bars in tow.</p>

Actually, Yes!&apos;</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/29/030248/did-anything-good-happen-in-2024-actually-yes?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Washington Post shares some good news from 2024:

Researchers were able to detect a significant dip in atmospheric levels of hydrochlorofluorocarbons &mdash; harmful gases that deplete the ozone layer &mdash; for the first time, almost 30 years after countries first agreed to phase out the chemicals. 

A new satellite launched in March to track and publicly reveal the biggest methane polluters in the oil and gas industry &mdash; an important step in tackling the greenhouse gas that accounts for almost a third of global warming. The NASA/Carbon Mapper satellite, which measures CO2 and methane emissions, also launched, providing detailed images from individual oil and gas facilities across the world. 

Back on Earth, the world's largest plant for pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere opened in Iceland. Norway became the first country to have more electric than gas-powered vehicles, while one Japanese island began using a new generation of batteries to help stockpile massive amounts of clean electricity. 

There were also small but important victories for animal conservation. The Iberian lynx, a European wildcat once on the brink of extinction, is no longer classed as an "endangered" species &mdash; in what experts have hailed as the "greatest recovery of a cat species ever achieved through conservation...." 

Despite a large number of powerful tornadoes to hit the United States in early 2024, the death tolls were fortunately not as high as meteorologists feared, in part due to improved forecasting technology. 

The article also notes America's Food and Drug Administration approved a new therapy which uses a patients' own cells to attack skin cancer for adults for whom surgery isn't an option. "Experts said the decision could open the door to similar treatments for far more common cancers." 

And one more inspiring story from 2024: 105-year-old Virginia Hislop, of Yakima, Washington received her master's degree from Stanford University...<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<h2 id="4experiments">4. Experiments</h2>
<p>We rigorously evaluated LLaVA-Phi using an extensive array of academic benchmarks specifically designed for multi-modal models. These included tests for general question-answering such as VQA-v2 [12], VizWizQA [14], ScienceQA [28], and TextQA [31], as well as more specialized assessments like POPE [22] for evaluating object hallucination, and MME [10], MMBench [27], and MMVet [36] for a comprehensive evaluation of diverse multi-modal abilities, such as visual understanding and visual commonsense reasoning.</p>
<p>\
These benchmarks are meticulously structured to challenge and scrutinize complex multi-modal tasks. We benchmarked LLaVA-Phi against a variety of state-of-the-art, large vision-language models, as detailed in Table 1. It is important to note that both our method and LLaVA1.5 utilize the same publicly available datasets for pre-training and visual instruction fine-tuning.</p>
<p>\
Our model demonstrated a capacity for visual-based question-answering, surpassing many existing large multimodal models. Remarkably, LLaVA-Phi outperformed models that use 7B-parameter or larger Large Language Models (LLMs) as their backbone, such as IDEFICS [17] and InstructBLIP [8]. A particularly notable achievement was our model’s best performance on ScienceQA [28]. We attribute this success to the Phi-2 language model, which has been specifically trained on code generation and mathematical corpora, thereby enhancing our multi-modal model’s prowess in math-based question-answering.</p>
<p>\
In the comprehensive multi-modal benchmark of MMBench [27], LLaVA-Phi showed significantly superior performance compared to many existing 7B-LLM-based vision-language models. For example, our model outperformed Otter by 11.5% and InstructBLIP by 23.8%. This underscores the effectiveness of LLaVA-Phi in handling complex multi-modal tasks, reinforcing the potential of smaller, more efficient models in the rapidly evolving field of multi-modal models.</p>
<p>\
We also compared to MobileVLM [6], a concurrent work that builds up an efficient vision-language model. Across all five benchmarks, our LLaVA-Phi consistently outperforms their method. It’s important to note that the margins of lead are modest, with the exception of ScienceQA. We attribute this performance disparity primarily to the differences in the pretraining stages of the language models.</p>

Started in 1984 (and inspired partly by a bug in the classic Bourne shell), it's "the Internet's oldest contest," acording to their official social media account on Mastodon. 

The contest enters its "pending" state today at 2024-12-29 23:58 UTC &mdash; meaning an opening date for submissions has been officially scheduled (for January 31st) as well as a closing date roughly eight weeks later on April 1st, 2025. That's according to the newly-released (proposed and tentative) rules and guidelines, listing contest goals like "show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way" and "stress C compilers with unusual code." And the contest's home page adds an additional goal: "to have fun with C!" 

Excerpts from the official rules:


Rule 0 
Just as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) 

Rule 1 
Your submission must be a complete program.... 

Rule 5 
Your submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... 


Rule 6 
I am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); 
 while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {
 ha_ha_ha();
 } 

 
Rule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:
 You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. 

There are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... 


We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.
 

And this weekend there was also a second announcement:

After a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries. A number of fixes and improvements involve the ability of reasonable modern Unix/Linux systems to be able to compile and even run them.

Just as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) 

Rule 1 
Your submission must be a complete program.... 

Rule 5 
Your submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... 


Rule 6 
I am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); 
 while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {
 ha_ha_ha();
 } 

 
Rule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:
 You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. 

There are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... 


We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.
 

And this weekend there was also a second announcement:

After a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries. A number of fixes and improvements involve the ability of reasonable modern Unix/Linux systems to be able to compile and even run them.

What awaits those choosing to return home?

Ten years ago, Syrian Omar Al Masry went into exile in Beirut. One of his brothers died in an Assad torture prison and before he fled, Omar himself spent three months in one of the regime's notorious prison camps. Now, the 38-year-old is overjoyed and confident that Syria's dark years are behind it. We accompany him as he returns to Damascus and his home village of Qatana for the first time. What hopes do Omar and his family have for the future? What difficulties will they encounter? A report by Jan-Philipp Scholz.

<h2 id="62basicsampling">6.2 Basic Sampling</h2>
<p>We evaluate the performance of vLLM with basic sampling (one sample per request) on three models and two datasets. The first row of Fig. 12 shows the results on the ShareGPT dataset. The curves illustrate that as the request rate increases, the latency initially increases at a gradual pace but then suddenly explodes. This can be attributed to the fact that when the request rate surpasses the capacity of the serving system, the queue length continues to grow infinitely and so does the latency of the requests.</p>
<p>\
On the ShareGPT dataset, vLLM can sustain 1.7×–2.7× higher request rates compared to Orca (Oracle) and 2.7×–8× compared to Orca (Max), while maintaining similar latencies. This is because vLLM’s PagedAttention can efficiently manage the memory usage and thus enable batching more requests than Orca. For example, as shown in Fig. 13a, for OPT-13B vLLM processes 2.2× more requests at the same time than Orca (Oracle) and 4.3× more requests than Orca (Max). Compared to FasterTransformer, vLLM can sustain up to 22× higher request rates, as FasterTransformer does not utilize a fine-grained scheduling mechanism and inefficiently manages the memory like Orca (Max).</p>
<p>\
The second row of Fig. 12 and Fig. 13b shows the results on the Alpaca dataset, which follows a similar trend to the ShareGPT dataset. One exception is Fig. 12 (f), where vLLM’s advantage over Orca (Oracle) and Orca (Pow2) is less pronounced. This is because the model and server configuration for OPT-175B (Table 1) allows for large GPU memory space available to store KV cache, while the Alpaca dataset has short sequences. In this setup, Orca (Oracle) and Orca (Pow2) can also batch a large number of requests despite the inefficiencies in their memory management. As a result, the performance of the systems becomes compute-bound rather than memory-bound.</p>

The latest version of the language pushes the envelope further for speed and power, sheds many of Python's most decrepit elements, and broadens its appeal with developers worldwide. Here's a look back at the year in Python. 

In the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or "GIL," a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue &mdash; enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. 

The no-GIL or "free-threaded" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. 
Another forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.
 
Python is now more widely used than JavaScript on GitHub (thanks partly to its role in AI and data science code).<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The name can be roughly translated as "cold place." The film tells the story of three women: the farmer Hanna, the postwoman Maria and the biologist Nelya.

In the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, the three protagonists must grapple with their social reality - and loneliness. Very few young people live here, but the elderly women are deeply rooted to their village and its surroundings. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.

In a tiny kitchen, Hanna shares her feelings of loneliness with the filmmakers, who she says remind her of her deceased sons. At the village post office, post woman Maria has neither stamps nor heating, but customers are warmed with liquor and songs. Somewhere in the woods and caves, biologist Nelya looks for the animal droppings that are a treasure to her. The film portrays an unknown place at the heart of Europe, where people make a daily choice - stay or leave?

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly’s have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!

Is humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?

Next, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity’s urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation—until it doesn’t. What happens to a photon’s energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe’s edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck’s constant would do to the universe. 

Was human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity’s ultimate motivator?

Could alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made "Matrix"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?

Finally, we explore humanity’s potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their "Matrix"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?

Taken from City in the Sky.

At any one time, there are a million people flying above our heads. But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century. And with air-passenger numbers predicted to double in the next 20 years, it also looks at what the industry will have to do to keep up.

<p>After decades of tracking my exercise programs in progressively more complex spreadsheets I eventually burned out on metrics and complicated periodization programs to the point where I had almost stopped exercising.<p>I am now at a place where I simply want the minimal amount of structure and tracking to make sure I can maintain my fitness, so I boiled the entire concept down to what I felt was its essence: enough information and structure to remind you of what is needed today, and how it went on the same exercises last week.<p>To reduce friction, the interface is kept as simple as possible. Simple to the point where all setup is done by editing the html source file and there is only one freeform "weight" textbox per exercise to manipulate. Data is autosaved as it is entered. It never nags or judges you except by showing the last date you entered data in for that day-of-the-week's exercises. The only quality-of-life feature is a super-simple rest period timer in the footer.<p>It has no external dependencies and only uses browser local storage. There is no possibility of monetizing it.<p>I was on the fence about sharing since it is such a small and simple project, but decided I would share here in case anyone is looking to make a fresh start in the new year and finds the philosophy appealing.</p>

There is increasing evidence in the field of neuroscience that art enhances brain function by impacting brain wave patterns, emotions, and the nervous system. But more abstractly, does art have the power to affect the self? That is, a person’s beliefs, thoughts, feelings, identity. What impact does art have on the individual consuming it?

<p>Hey HN!<p>I used to spend hours drawing all kind of things as a kid. Sadly though, those drawings are long gone.<p>Inspired by this, I created DoodleDreams. A webapp that brings drawings to life using AI and stores them as memories. You can always look back at the drawings, see who made them, and even know the age they were drawn at.<p>I thought it was a fun way to preserve those memories. What do you think?<p>Viktor</p>

Soldiers served for 25 years, and upon retirement, they were often granted land in far-flung parts of the empire. The life of a soldier was demanding, involving military training, campaigns, and marching across the empire, equipped with weapons like the Pilum, Gladius, and Scutum, along with protective armor like the Lorica Segmentata.

They’re concerned by the issue of animal welfare. But a primary motive is the ecological impact of industrial livestock farming.

Industrial livestock farming is responsible for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It also requires huge amounts of land and water and is thought to be contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. This is why more and more scientists and entrepreneurs are conducting research on alternatives to conventional meat production.

In California, Joshua Tetrick is working on a method of growing meat in a bioreactor. He multiplies the muscle cells of chickens in huge tanks and cultivates them with plant-based nutrients. The resulting cell pulp is molded into fibrous meat with the help of a plant scaffold. A kilo still costs many hundreds of dollars. But Joshua Tetrick hopes that production can be scaled up to a globally relevant level. After all, with ‘Good Meat’ he was one of the first two companies in the USA to receive a license for cultured meat.

At the University of California, Alison Van Eenennaam is trying to make meat production more efficient.  Using the gene editing tool CRISPR she’s altered the genetic make-up of a cow so that its offspring are exclusively male. This is a great advantage, as male calves grow faster and consume fewer resources than female calves to produce the same amount of meat - thereby reducing the carbon footprint of livestock farming. 

For Pasi Vainikka from ‘Solar Foods’ in Helsinki, these are all just intermediate steps on the way to a truly sustainable future food: he’s cultivating a whole new category of food in gigantic fermenters: Bacteria that are fed with CO2 and hydrogen and blended to create a product called ‘Solein’. A flavorless, protein-rich basic ingredient that can replace eggs and milk in practically all foods.

Science journalist Ingolf Baur meets some of the researchers and entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to industrial livestock farming around the world.

But live television, usually reserved for news, sporting events, and a single Saturday night-airing sketch comedy show, retains its capacity to capture true-life drama as it unfolds in real time. And those images become unforgettable moments in modern history.

ABSTRACT
This talk will focus on lessons learned in Experience Design and how those concepts can be applied to not just your products- but your career growth as a leader.

My career as a technologist has historically been focusing on digital design and UX. In the last decade of my career however, I have been focusing much more on experience design - and engaging people and communities away from technology. I have been studying how to engage people and draw them into a community or conversation - curating every detail across multiple touchpoints including what people see, hear, smell, taste–and above else–feel.

Experience design is critical to designing digital experiences and innovative new products. But it can also be used to explore better workplace policies, better experiences for employees, and even shape creative career paths.

Together, we’ll explore how experience designers are able to explore new ways of addressing the problems their people face. [...]

2024 saw over 60 elections worldwide, many of which were marked with controversy. It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. 

Despite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. 

2024 had much of the world voting for change. Onward, to 2025 where we will find out what it means.

Correction: At 4:16 we show the wrong clip of Pope Francis. Our clip shows him visiting Myanmar in 2017 — we meant to include a clip from his 2024 visit to Indonesia.

WSJ breaks down the logistics and explains why an operation of this scale could require hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of a decade.

networking app</strong> where user profiles can vary widely:</p><ul><li><p>One user may have: three hobbies, a short bio.</p></li><li><p>Another user may have: two hobbies, multiple addresses and favorite sports.</p></li></ul><p>If you try to represent these fields in a traditional relational database, you might need several tables and constant schema changes each time you add or modify a field.</p><p>With a flexible schema, you can simply update the document structure on the fly. To achieve this, you need a database that can adapt to changing fields quickly.</p><h4>Recommended Databases - <strong>Document Database</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>MongoDB: </strong>Stores data in JSON-like documents, making it highly flexible and intuitive for developers. Ideal for use cases like social networks, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Couchbase: </strong>Combines flexible JSON-based document storage with high-performance key-value operations. Provides strong support for offline-first applications, with built-in synchronization features.</p></li></ul><h2>3. Needs Caching</h2><p><strong>Caching</strong> is a powerful technique that improves application performance by storing frequently accessed data in a high-speed storage layer&#8212;typically in memory.</p><p>This allows future requests for the same data to be served much faster, bypassing the need for time-consuming queries to slower, disk-based databases or external systems..</p><div

File Storage</h2><p>Many modern applications need to efficiently store and serve media files&#8212;such as images, videos, audio, or other large binary objects.</p><p>For Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Streaming Platforms</strong>: Services like YouTube or Netflix store and deliver massive amounts of video content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Media</strong>: Platforms like Instagram and Facebook manage billions of user-uploaded images and videos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image Hosting Services</strong>: Smaller-scale platforms also require reliable storage and fast delivery for user-uploaded content.</p></li></ul><p>While traditional relational or NoSQL databases can store binary data as <strong>BLOBs (Binary Large Objects)</strong>, they are not optimized for such use cases due to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Storing large binary files in databases increases storage costs and complexity, especially as the data grows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Serving media files directly from a database introduces latency and slows down overall system performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cost</strong>: Databases often charge based on storage and throughput, making them less cost-effective for handling large files.</p></li></ol><p>For these reasons, dedicated <strong>object storage</strong> solutions, often combined with <strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</strong>, are the preferred approach.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

Highly Connected Data</h2><p>In many systems, data isn&#8217;t just a collection of rows and columns&#8212;it&#8217;s a <strong>web of interconnected entities</strong>. </p><p>In such cases, the relationships between entities are as important as, or sometimes even more critical than, the entities themselves. This is what we call <strong>highly connected data</strong>.</p><p>For Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Social Networks</strong>: Platforms like Facebook analyze relationships to suggest friends, identify communities, and calculate mutual connections or shortest paths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recommendation Systems</strong>: E-commerce platforms like Amazon recommend products based on user behavior and connections between users, items, and categories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge Graphs</strong>: Search engines or content platforms connect concepts to deliver enriched, contextual results.</p></li></ul><p>While traditional relational databases can model relationships using foreign keys and join operations, they fall short in handling highly connected data due to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Complex Queries</strong>: Multi-hop queries, such as &#8220;friends of friends of friends,&#8221; become cumbersome and slow in an RDBMS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Traversing deeply connected relationships often involves costly joins, which degrade performance as the dataset grows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rigid Schema</strong>: Relational databases require a predefined schema, making it harder to adapt to dynamic or evolving relationships.</p></li></ol><h4>Recommended Database -

Metrics Data and Time Series</h2><p><strong>Time series data</strong> consists of sequential data points, each associated with a timestamp, representing how a system, process, or metric evolves over time. </p><p>Examples include CPU usage, request latencies, error rates, stock prices, temperature readings, or user activity logs.</p><p>These datasets often arrive at high frequencies, requiring efficient ingestion, storage, and retrieval for both <strong>real-time monitoring</strong> and <strong>historical trend analysis.</strong></p><p>Although you can store time series data in relational databases or NoSQL solutions, it&#8217;s <strong>not always optimal</strong>.</p><h4>Recommended Databases:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Time Series Databases (TSDBs): </strong>Purpose-built for time series data, these databases provide optimized storage, indexing, and query capabilities for time-based data.</p><ul><li><p><strong>InfluxDB</strong>: Designed explicitly for time series data and offers powerful query features.</p></li><li><p><strong>TimescaleDB</strong>: Built on top of PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB extends relational database capabilities with time series features.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wide-Column Databases: </strong>For scenarios requiring distributed scalability and high write throughput, wide-column stores can also handle time series data effectively.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong>: Supports high-velocity writes and distributed architecture, making it suitable for time series workloads.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>8. Analytics on Ever-Growing Data</h2><p>In scenarios where you're tasked with analyzing massive and ever-growing datasets&#8212;often scaling to terabytes or even petabytes&#8212;you need databases optimized for high-performance analytics.</p><p>These use cases typically involve complex queries, large aggregations, reporting, or feeding data into machine learning pipelines.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>E-commerce platforms</strong> analyzing user behavior, purchase trends, and inventory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social media platforms</strong> deriving insights from billions of user interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>IoT systems</strong> processing sensor data from millions of devices.</p></li></ul><p>Handling these workloads requires databases designed for fast reads and aggregations, even as data continues to grow exponentially.</p><h4>Recommended Databases:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Columnar Databases</strong>: These databases store data in a columnar format, making them ideal for analytical queries that scan and aggregate large datasets.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Amazon Redshift</strong>: Fully managed and highly scalable, supports SQL-based analytics with seamless integration into the AWS ecosystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snowflake</strong>: A cloud-native, multi-cluster data warehouse offering separate compute and storage scaling for high flexibility and performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google BigQuery</strong>: Serverless and highly scalable, ideal for real-time analytics and ad hoc queries on massive datasets.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wide-Column Stores</strong>: These databases are well-suited for analytical workloads that demand high write throughput.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong>: Designed for distributed scalability and high write performance, commonly used in real-time analytics pipelines.</p></li><li><p><strong>HBase</strong>: Built on top of Hadoop, ideal for low-latency random reads and writes, often used in conjunction with Hadoop ecosystems for big data analytics.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>9. Spatial Data</h2><p>Spatial data refers to any data that describes a location, shape, or boundary on Earth. This typically involves storing <strong>latitude and longitude</strong> coordinates (for points) or polygons (for areas).</p><p>If your application relies on <strong>where</strong> as much as <strong>what,</strong> you'll need a database that natively supports spatial data types and queries.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>ride-sharing service</strong> like Uber needs to find nearby drivers and calculate distances in real time.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>food delivery service</strong> like Swiggy or Zomato must locate nearby restaurants and customers efficiently.</p></li></ul><p>Handling spatial data requires specialized indexing and query functions to perform geometric calculations like distance, overlap, and adjacency. </p><p>Traditional B-tree or hash indexes aren&#8217;t optimized for multi-dimensional data. Instead, spatial data structures like <strong>R-trees</strong>, <strong>Quadtrees</strong>, and <strong>Geohashes</strong> are used to narrow down search areas efficiently.</p><div

People, myself included, like to say that POSIX time, also known as Unix time, is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">number</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Seconds-since-the-Epoch.html">of</a> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/time.2.html">seconds</a> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#Unix">since</a> <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/datetime.html">the</a> <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Time.html">Unix</a> <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/timestamp_type_r.html">epoch</a>, which was 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00.</p>
<p>This is not true. Or rather, it isn’t true in the sense most people think. For example, it is presently 2024-12-25 at 18:51:26 UTC. The POSIX time is 1735152686. It has been 1735152723 seconds since the POSIX epoch. The POSIX time number is thirty-seven seconds lower.</p>
<p>This is because POSIX time is derived <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub151-1.pdf">in IEEE 1003.1</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a>. The standard assumes that every day is exactly 86,400 seconds long. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>time()</em> function returns the value of time in <b>seconds since the Epoch</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>seconds since the Epoch.</b> A value to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch. A Coordinated Universal Time name (specified in terms of seconds (<em>tm_sec</em>), minutes (<em>tm_min</em>), hours (<em>tm_hour</em>), days since January 1 of the year (<em>tm_yday</em>), and calendar year minus 1900
(<em>tm_year</em>)) is related to a time represented as <em>seconds since the Epoch</em> according to the expression below.</p>
<p>If year &lt; 1970 or the value is negative, the relationship is undefined. If year ≥ 1970 and the value is non-negative, the value is related to a Coordinated Universal Time name according to the expression:</p>
<p><em>tm_sec</em> + <em>tm_min</em> * 60 + <em>tm_hour</em> * 3600 + <em>tm_yday</em> * 86400 +
(<em>tm_year</em>-70) * 31536000 + ((<em>tm_year</em> - 69) / 4) * 86400</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of the day is not 86,400 seconds, and in fact changes over time. To keep UTC days from drifting too far from solar days, astronomers periodically declare a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap second</a> in UTC. Consequently, every few years POSIX time jumps backwards, <a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=134113577921904">wreaking</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/qantas-suffers-delays-due-to-linux-leap-second-bug/">utter</a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/">havoc</a>. Someday it might jump forward.</p>
<h2><a href="#archaeology" id="archaeology">Archaeology</a></h2>
<p>Appendix B of IEEE 1003 has a fascinating discussion of leap seconds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of leap seconds is added for precision; at the time this standard was published, 14 leap seconds had been added since January 1, 1970. These 14 seconds are ignored to provide an easy and compatible method of computing time differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, too, love to ignore things to make my life easy. The standard authors knew “seconds since the epoch” were not, in fact, seconds since the epoch. And they admit as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most systems’ notion of “time” is that of a continuously-increasing value, so this value should increase even during leap seconds. However, not only do most systems not keep track of leap seconds, but most systems are probably not synchronized to any standard time reference. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require that a time represented as seconds since the Epoch precisely represent the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to require that applications be allowed to treat this time as if it represented the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch. It is the responsibility of the vendor of the system, and the administrator of the system, to ensure that this value represents the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch as closely as necessary for the application being run on that system….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine there was some debate over this point. The appendix punts, saying that vendors and administrators must make time align “as closely as necessary”, and that “this value should increase even during leap seconds”. The latter is achievable, but the former is arguably impossible: the standard requires POSIX clocks be twenty-nine seconds off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consistent interpretation of seconds since the Epoch can be critical to certain types of distributed applications that rely on such timestamps to synchronize events. The accrual of leap seconds in a time standard is not predictable. The number of leap seconds since the Epoch will likely increase. The standard is
more concerned about the synchronization of time between applications of astronomically short duration and the Working Group expects these concerns to become more critical in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a sense, the opposite happened. Time synchronization is <em>always</em> off, so systems generally function (however incorrectly) when times drift a bit. But leap seconds are rare, and the linearity evoked by the phrase “seconds since the epoch” is so deeply baked in to our intuition, that software can accrue serious, unnoticed bugs. Until a few years later, one of those tiny little leap seconds takes down a big chunk of the internet.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-to-do-instead" id="what-to-do-instead">What To Do Instead</a></h2>
<p>If you just need to compute the duration between two events on one computer, use <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/reference_guide/sect-posix_clocks#sect-POSIX_clocks">CLOCK_MONOTONIC</a>. If you don’t need to exchange timestamps with other systems that assume POSIX time, use <a href="https://www.ipses.com/eng/in-depth-analysis/standard-of-time-definition/">TAI, GPS, or maybe LORAN</a>. If you do need rough alignment with other POSIX-timestamp systems, <a href="https://developers.google.com/time/smear">smear leap seconds</a> over a longer window of time. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/qntm/t-a-i">qntm’s t-a-i</a> can convert back and forth between POSIX and TAI.</p>
<p>There’s an ongoing effort to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/end-of-leap-seconds-2022">end leap seconds</a>, hopefully <a href="https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/64811223/Resolutions-2022.pdf/281f3160-fc56-3e63-dbf7-77b76500990f">by 2035</a>. It’ll require additional work to build conversion tables into everything that relies on the “86,400 seconds per day” assumption, but it should also make it much simpler to ask questions like “how many seconds between these two times”. At least for times after 2035!</p>

What is important, and what can go? The better storage options become, the more difficult it is to answer this question.

We humans like to preserve everything, whether we’ve collected or created it. Be it sourdough starters, books or blood samples. We want to preserve objects, memories and even microorganisms. 

Karl de Smedt is the only sourdough librarian in the world. In St. Vith, Belgium, he keeps 144 sourdough starters from all over the globe, some of which are over 100 years old. Through his collection, he preserves the unique wild yeasts and microorganisms that create each sourdough. 

The German National Library in Leipzig and Frankfurt preserves copies of all books, records and media published in or about Germany since 1913. There are 34 million physical media on the shelves. Digitization can solve the space problem, but also has its pitfalls. For example: data has to be constantly copied, as hard disks can become unusable.

Prof. Robert Grass from ETH Zurich is developing a particularly promising storage medium: DNA storage. It is extremely powerful, can be stored for over 1,000 years and can always be read. Data is converted into the DNA code and stored as artificial DNA.

BioBank Dresden stores tumor samples, blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid for research purposes. Evidence from criminal offenses is stored in the evidence room of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt am Main. This allows crimes to be re-analyzed using modern techniques and solved decades later.

Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? 

If generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? 

If a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? 

Today, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor. What is the Mission Control for a software engineer in the era of autonomous development?<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Sometimes we establish something as a historical “first” or historical “last.” Other times, we label people, places, or periods as the “worst” because, well, they’re kind of awful. But finding the “most” of something can also put history into perspective - strange world records right out of the Guinness book that offer surprising insight into the past. Some of these “mosts” are genuine testaments to human strength, endurance, creativity, and spirit, while others, are not so much.

Throughout history, particularly during the Second World War, many images were heavily censored and the use of cameras were banned in certain circumstances. Strict rules posed challenges for both the censors and photographers, and the resulting images are intriguing, to say the least. 

There are now 11 million photographs in the Imperial War Museum’s archive, many with intriguing stories behind them. But how has the role of war photographer changed throughout history? What were the rules and how did photographers get around them?

ABSTRACT
Navigating the complexities of Generative AI (GenAI) is made simpler with serverless technologies and API-driven approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs). This session will showcase how leveraging embeds with Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) and AWS Step Functions can streamline GenAI application development.

Additionally, we’ll demonstrate how Amazon Bedrock simplifies interacting with LLMs. By the end, you’ll understand how these tools offer a straightforward path to creating effective and targeted GenAI applications. [...]

<p>As a grad student (and an ADHDer), I had trouble doing literature review systematically. To combat this, I made a website that finds similar papers using the meaning of the thing I am looking for.<p>I used MixedBread's [^1] embedding model to generate vectors from the abstracts. I store and search similar vectors using Milvus [^2] and finally use Gradio [^3] to serve the frontend. I update the vector database weekly by pulling the metadata dataset from Kaggle [^4].<p>To speed up the search process on my free oracle instance, I binarise the embeddings and use Hamming distance as a metric.<p>I would love your feedback on the site :)

<p>Hello, I'm working on a web browser that focuses on being truly lightweight and designed for privacy.<p>At some point I've realized that much of the complexity and resource requirements of web browsers comes from JavaScript. This is because every part needs to be dynamic and optimized for speed.<p>So a few years ago I've started to work on a web browser that intentionally doesn't implement JavaScript, instead it contains an updated set of scripts that fix and improve various websites.<p>I've been using this approach using a proxy server for a few years as my primary way of web browsing with good results. It uses a whitelist approach where no resources are loaded from different domains by default (the fix scripts can override it to load images from CDNs, etc.). This avoids any trackers by default.<p>You can find more details on the homepage of the project:<p><a href="https://www.fixbrowser.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.fixbrowser.org/</a><p>I'm currently running a fundraiser to get it really going. All the foundation blocks are there it just needs some more work. Any support is welcome.</p>

Are alien spacecraft here on Earth? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice discuss the UAP hearings, unexplained cosmic phenomena, dark matter, and more with astrophysicist and NASA UAP chair David Spergel.

David reveals what it’s like to investigate UFOs scientifically, explaining why most sightings turn out to be lens flares or misidentified objects— but also why the 1% of unexplained events still intrigue researchers. Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.

Switching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy. Learn how groundbreaking tools like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and collaborations with ESA’s Euclid mission aim to answer fundamental questions about the universe.  We discuss computational astrophysics and the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. From UFOs to cutting-edge astrophysics, this episode offers a clear-eyed look at the mysteries of the universe.

Workers endure starvation wages, and toxic materials in the jewelry endanger customers' health. This film uncovers the origins and production of these items.

Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu supply the world with trendy jewelry - chunky chains, sparkling earrings, and gold bracelets. Some 6,000 new lines are added every day to the Shein range alone. But behind the glossy façade lies a harsh reality. In the factories where these pieces are produced, grueling 60-hour workweeks are the norm, encapsulated in China’s infamous "9-9-6” culture: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While the jewelry is dirt cheap, the workers bear the cost. The risks aren’t limited to factory conditions; the products themselves often endanger customers. Testing frequently reveals toxic heavy metals and harmful chemicals. Scientists featured in the film unpack the health implications, shedding light on the hidden dangers of this booming industry.

Two German family businesses, Bijou Brigitte and the Beeline Group, are making significant sales across Europe. Their sustainability reports offer vague promises and little transparency about supply chains, leaving customers in the dark about where and how their trendy jewelry is produced. The film crew traces the steps of the supply chain all the way to China to find out more.

Holistic Evaluation of Generative AI Systems // MLOps Podcast #280 with Jineet Doshi, Staff AI Scientist or AI Lead at Intuit.

// Abstract
Evaluating LLMs is essential in establishing trust before deploying them to production. Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.

More than 30,000 people have been freed from its prisons, but a further 100,000 remain missing. Families are desperately searching for their loved ones - including Hind Gharz al Deen, whose son Hussam is missing.

Hussam disappeared eight years ago. Together with her younger son Ahmad, Hind visits hospitals, morgues and the notorious Sednaya prison to look for him. The family is one of thousands in Syria clinging to the hope of finding their loved ones alive. In one hospital, photos of recovered bodies cover a wall. Many of the victims are horribly disfigured - a further reason why the search is agonizing for family members.

For Ahmad, looking for his older brother in Sednaya prison is particularly distressing. He was imprisoned there himself after being arrested in 2018. The horrors he suffered still haunt him: the brutal conditions and the cruel torture. Ahmad recounts his experiences on December 8th, the day he and his fellow inmates were freed. Hind and Ahmad find no trace of Hussam, but they continue to search.

<p>Hi HN! I built KeyPub.sh to solve the problem of user verification for CLI applications. It's essentially OAuth for the terminal, but using SSH keys that developers and users already have.<p>- No installation needed - works with existing SSH setup
- Privacy-focused: users control what email info is shared
- Simple email verification process
- Free public service
- Perfect for CLI app developers who don't want to build user verification<p>Try it with:
`$ ssh keypub.sh about`<p>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/skariel/keypub">https://github.com/skariel/keypub</a></p>

One such tool is <a href="http://A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks">pre-commit</a>, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language <span class="text-nowrap">pre-commit</span> hooks. You use pre-commit to run one or more tools before allowing you to commit your code locally. For example, you might run the Flake8 linter or the <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/10/25/the-ruff-formatter-pythons-fastest-formatter/">Ruff formatter</a> on your Python code in GitHub Actions or some other CI. But rather than waiting for CI to run, you want to run those checks locally and automatically.</p>
<p>That is where pre-commit comes in. You tell pre-c0mmit what to run, and it will run right before it allows you to commit your code.If any of those checks fail, you must fix your code before committing it.</p>
<h2>Installing pre-commit</h2>
<p>pre-commit is a Python package, so you can install it using pip. Here&#8217;s the command you&#8217;ll need to run in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pip install pre-commit</pre>
<p>Once pre-commit is installed, you can confirm that it works by running the following:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit --version</pre>
<h2>Adding the git Hooks</h2>
<p>The next step is to navigate to one of your local GitHub code bases in your terminal. Once inside one of your repos, you will need to run this command:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit install</pre>
<p>This command installs pre-commit in your <code>.git\hooks</code> folder so that pre-commit runs whenever you commit. But how does pre-commit know what to run?</p>
<p>You have to define what <code>pre-commit</code> runs using a special YAML file. You&#8217;ll learn how in the next section!</p>
<h2>Adding a pre-commit Configuration</h2>
<p>You need to add a file named <strong>.pre-commit-config.yaml</strong> (note the leading period) into the root of your repo. If you want to generate a simple config file, you can run this command:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit sample-config</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example config for running Black on your code:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.10.0
    hooks:
    -   id: black</pre>
<p>Personally, I like to run the Ruff formatter and linter as well as a couple of defaults, so I use this config a lot:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-added-large-files

- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.1.7
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
</pre>
<p>When you add a new rule to pre-commit, you should run that rule against all the files in your repo so you don&#8217;t have any surprises later on. To do that, you need to run this command:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit run --all-files</pre>
<p>Once you have run all your new rules against all your code files, you can start working on your next feature or bug fix. Then, when you run,  <code>git commit</code> the pre-commit hooks will run, and you&#8217;ll see if your code is good enough to pass.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>There are TONs of hooks you can add to pre-commit. A lot of them are mentioned on the <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit website</a>. You can add Mypy, pytest, and much, much more to your pre-commit hooks. Just don&#8217;t get too crazy, or they may take too long to run, and you&#8217;ll go nuts waiting for it.</p>
<p>Overall, running so many of your CI hooks locally is great because your machine is usually faster than waiting on a queue in CI. Give it a try and see what think!</p>

ABSTRACT
A programmer, a mathematician, and a football nerd walk into a bar hoping to get the answer to one specific, big, and much-considered question. What is the true value of a goal in football?

This is the story of how a nerd sharing all three passions spent years dancing around this problem until his curiosity finally paid off and his love of technology delivered the ultimate answer.

This talk has it all - maths, coding, web scraping, algorithms, statistics...and the answer to the biggest question of them all: Who is the most valuable of all goal scorers - Ronaldo or Messi? [...]

The Herculaneum papyri are carbonized scrolls from the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum. Reading the fragile scrolls requires multiple scientific steps that starts with a modeling process to transport them in cases that match their exact shape. Next, the scrolls are subjected to an extremely high-resolution X-ray with a photon beam. Can these scientists do what seems impossible? Reading the inside of an ancient scroll without opening it?

It only has 3,500 inhabitants, but it’s a geopolitical heavyweight. A border battalion with 600 elite soldiers makes its military presence felt.

The two 19-year-old recruits David Bratland and Jesper Bruseth are doing their military service in Kirkenes with the ‘Jegerbataljonen GSV’. The training program for border fighters, around 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, is tough. In winter, temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius are not uncommon here. Added to that, just a few hours of daylight. During orienteering on skis, the recruits don’t just hone their physical fitness, but also their ability to take responsibility for their own actions. Their task: to monitor the almost 200-kilometer-long border with Russia and - in the event of war - to defend it. Recently, the soldiers have also received heavy weapons training for anti-aircraft and anti-tank defense.

Norway also demonstrates its claim to power and territory by promoting culture on behalf of the West. While David and Jesper cross the snow-covered expanses of the Norwegian tundra on skis, the Russian-born curator of the Barents Spektakel, Yevgeny Goman, is confronted with completely different challenges a few kilometers away on frozen Lake Förstevatne. The central element of the opening show of the art festival - a giant flying dragon - simply won't take off. But, in the end, the opening show the following evening turns out to be a great spectacle against hopelessness.

Every religion thunders its day of reckoning. To examine God’s judgment is to probe God’s character and perhaps assess God’s existence. If God does not exist, God’s judgment may expose it. If God does exist, and assuming God is merciful as well as just, maybe we’ve missed the meaning of God’s judgment.

The T2 Linux team has unveiled T2 Linux SDE 24.12, codenamed "Sky's the Limit!", delivering a massive update for this highly portable source-based Linux distribution... With 3,280 package updates, 206 new features, and the ability to boot on systems with as little as 512MB RAM, this release further strengthens T2 Linux's position as the ultimate tool for developers working across diverse hardware and embedded systems.
 
Some highlights from Rene's announcement:

 "The release includes 37 pre-compiled ISOs with Glibc, Musl, and uClibc, supporting 25 CPU architectures like ARM(64), RISCV(64), Loongarch64, SPARC(64), and vintage retro computing platforms such as M68k, Alpha, and even initial Nintendo Wii U support added."
" The Cosmic Desktop, a modern Rust-based environment, debuts alongside expanded application support for non-mainstream RISC architectures, now featuring LibreOffice, OpenJDK, and QEMU."

And T2sde.org gives this glimpse of the future: 

"While initially created for the Linux kernel, T2 already has proof-of-concept support for building 'home-brew' pkg for Other OS, including: BSDs, macOS and Haiku. Work on alternative micro kernels, such as L4, Fuchsia, RedoxOS or integrating building 'AOSP' Android is being worked on as well."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Microsoft-owned GitHub announced on Wednesday a free version of its popular Copilot code completion/AI pair programming tool, which will also now ship by default with Microsoft's popular VS Code editor. Until now, most developers had to pay a monthly fee, starting at $10 per month, with only verified students, teachers, and open source maintainers getting free access... 


There are some limitations to the free version, which is geared toward occasional users, not major work on a big project. Developers on the free plan will get access to 2,000 code completions per month, for example, and as a GitHub spokesperson told me, each Copilot code suggestion will count against this limit &mdash; not just accepted suggestions. And while GitHub recently added the ability to switch between different foundation models, users on the free plan are limited to Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o. (The paid plans also include Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and OpenAI's o1-preview and -mini.) For Copilot Chat, the number of chat messages is limited to 50, but otherwise, there aren't any major limitations to the free service. Developers still get access to all Copilot Extensions and skills. 

The free Copilot SKU will work in a number of editors, including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains, as well as on GitHub.com. 

GitHub's announcement ends with the words "Happy coding!" and calls the service "GitHub Copilot Free." But TechCrunch points out there's already competition from services like Amazon Q Developer, as well as from companies like Tabnine and Qodo (previously known as Codium) &mdash; and they typically offer a free tier. But in addition, "With Copilot Free, we are returning to our freemium roots," GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told TechCrunch, as well as "laying the groundwork for something far greater: AI represents our best path to enabling a GitHub with one billion developers. 

"There should be no barrier to entry for experiencing the joy of creating software. Now six years after being acquired by Microsoft, it indeed appears GitHub is still GitHub &mdash; and we are doing our thing." 

Or, as GitHub CEO Satya Nadella said in a video posted on LinkedIn, "The joy of coding is back! And we are looking forward to bringing the same experience to so many more people around the world."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Is this a joke? Our world, with its vast evils, the ‘best possible world’? It seems absurd. Yet some do claim that ultimately our world will be the best possible world, because the sum total of all the good, primarily generated by human free will and divine providence, will overpower all the obvious evils. Perhaps the calculus should include the entire cosmos?

Traditionally, <strong>software development has been supply-side constrained</strong> by the finite availability of skilled engineers. Despite immense investments, it is not uncommon to encounter software riddled with bugs and inefficiencies, even on platforms operated by billion-dollar companies. These issues reflect systemic bottlenecks that hinder the ability to meet growing demand for reliable, scalable software.</p><p>Artificial intelligence promises to shift this paradigm. AI has the potential to address these constraints by automating repetitive tasks, assisting in decision-making, and optimizing workflows. <strong>AI can be viewed as a transformative horizontal layer</strong> akin to the electricity grid or the internet, it is an enabler. Its potential to impact nearly every process in an organization demands a rethinking of its role. The challenge becomes how to integrate it into the core of organizational operations.</p><h3>From Supply-Side Constraints to Human Orchestration</h3><p>Software engineering relies heavily on human labor for execution at every level, from writing functions to debugging and maintaining systems. This reliance creates bottlenecks as demand for software outpaces the availability of skilled talent. While traditional tools improved productivity incrementally, they did not address the fundamental limitations of human bandwidth.</p><p>AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), mark a significant departure from this trajectory. These systems enable assisted coding, provide architectural suggestions, and help identify design patterns and anti-patterns in real time. Engineers increasingly shift from writing low-level code to orchestrating systems: combining AI-generated components, validating their accuracy, and integrating them into larger workflows.</p><p>Orchestration, as a human role, embodies this transition. It involves guiding AI to produce outcomes aligned with high-level design goals and ensuring that the resulting systems are robust, maintainable, and aligned with organizational objectives. This shift transforms engineers into curators of functionality and systems thinkers.</p><h3>AI as a Horizontal Layer: Shifting to the Center</h3><p>AI’s impact extends far beyond isolated tools for code generation or testing. As a horizontal layer, AI can improve processes across an entire organization, from development and operations to customer support and strategy. Just as electricity and the internet became foundational to modern organizations, AI has the potential to underpin nearly every business process.</p><p>To realize this potential, AI must move from a peripheral, supplementary role to the center of organizational decision-making and operations. This shift requires cultural, structural, and procedural changes:</p><ol><li><strong>Centralized AI Strategy</strong>: AI should not be siloed within individual teams or projects. Organizations need a unified AI strategy that spans departments, with clearly defined goals for integrating AI into all workflows. Some processes will become automated entirely.</li><li><strong>AI-Driven Process Redesign</strong>: Processes must be redesigned to leverage AI fully. This includes automating repetitive tasks, improving data analysis pipelines, and enabling predictive decision-making across teams.</li><li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration</strong>: Engineers and domain experts must learn to collaborate with AI, focusing on curating inputs, validating outputs, and managing systems holistically. How to move data more efficiently into AI systems will be a key challenge.</li></ol><h3>High-Value Decisions and Human Oversight</h3><p>While AI can transform many areas, its role in high-value, high-stakes decisions remains limited. For example, while autopilot systems can technically manage most aspects of flight, human pilots are still in command due to the complex, high-risk nature of their work. Similarly, in software engineering, areas like system security, mission-critical infrastructure, and regulatory compliance rely heavily on human oversight.</p><p>These environments present unique challenges for AI adoption:</p><ul><li><strong>Specialized Systems</strong>: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge and precision, such as cryptographic algorithms, high-performance computing (HPC), or real-time trading systems, often fall outside AI’s general-purpose capabilities.</li><li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: In scenarios where failure carries significant consequences (e.g., healthcare systems or aviation software), organizations are unlikely to entrust AI with autonomous decision-making.</li><li><strong>Human Judgment</strong>: High-value decisions often involve qualitative factors that AI struggles to interpret, such as ethical considerations or conflicting stakeholder priorities.</li></ul><p>In such contexts, AI will serve as an assistant rather than a replacement, helping humans process large datasets, identify patterns, and simulate potential outcomes. Feeding the right data into AI systems and asking the right questions become crucial skills, requiring close collaboration between domain experts and AI tools.</p><h3>The Evolving Role of Software Engineers and Technical Leadership</h3><p>The widespread adoption of AI reshapes the roles of engineers, technical leaders, and executives alike:</p><ol><li><strong>Software Engineers</strong> Engineers increasingly move from function-level tasks to system-level orchestration. Their role becomes one of managing abstractions, curating AI outputs, and ensuring that automated components align with broader objectives. Proficiency in leveraging AI tools, debugging AI-generated code, and adapting workflows to accommodate AI capabilities will define the next generation of engineers. Specialization, as always, will continue to pay a premium for a significant while.</li><li><strong>Staff Engineers</strong> As stewards of architectural integrity, staff engineers focus on integrating AI-generated components into larger systems. They ensure that AI outputs align with system-wide goals, resolve inconsistencies, and enforce reliability standards. Mentorship becomes a key responsibility as they guide teams in navigating AI-enhanced workflows.</li><li><strong>Technical Leadership</strong> CXOs must lead the cultural and strategic shift toward AI-centric operations. This includes:</li></ol><ul><li>Establishing governance frameworks for AI use.</li><li>Identifying high-impact areas for AI integration.</li><li>Balancing automation with human oversight to mitigate risks.</li></ul><h3>From Creativity to Precision: AI’s Broader Impacts</h3><p>AI’s influence spans domains that demand creativity, precision, and scalability. In creative processes, AI enables rapid iteration, empowering individuals to achieve what once required large teams. However, these gains depend on human expertise to guide and refine AI’s outputs. Creativity-focused AI tools will likely remain diverse and scattered, as outcomes depend heavily on subjective preferences and domain-specific tuning.</p><p>In precision-oriented domains, such as accounting or high-performance computing, AI adoption faces greater challenges. The deterministic nature of these tasks requires accuracy and reliability that AI systems cannot consistently guarantee. While AI may play assistive roles in such environments, human oversight will remain indispensable for the foreseeable future.</p><h3>Future of Software Engineering in an AI-Driven World</h3><p>The integration of AI into software engineering represents a profound transformation. It shifts the role of engineers from implementers to orchestrators, enables organizations to scale processes with unprecedented efficiency, and positions AI as a foundational layer of modern business operations. However, the successful adoption of AI requires careful planning, cultural adaptation, and a clear understanding of its limitations.</p><p>Addressing supply-side constraints, enhancing human capabilities, and embedding itself as a horizontal layer, AI promises to unlock new levels of productivity and innovation. The future of software engineering lies in harnessing this potential — not by replacing humans, but by amplifying their ability to create, innovate, and solve complex problems at scale.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=feb4b040c4c4" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US judge finds NSO Group liable for hacking journalists via WhatsApp</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-judge-finds-israels-nso-group-liable-hacking-whatsapp-lawsuit-2024-12-21/</link><author>o999</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 01:38:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.

// Abstract
Indexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.

The latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. 

We discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.

We conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.

Houthi rebels have turned one of the world’s most critical trade routes into a shooting gallery. Thousands of miles away, distress calls from targeted vessels are routed to the U.K. Navy’s response center for maritime trade operations. 

WSJ visited the UKMTO headquarters in the U.K. to understand why the West is still at war in the Red Sea and how the U.S. and its allies are trying to wrestle back control of these vital waterways.

Chapters:

Even though data moves close to the speed of light, crossing thousands of miles takes more time than traveling a few hundred.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overloaded Servers:</strong> When a server receives more requests than it can handle, it slows down. This overload can happen due to sudden traffic spikes, inefficient resource usage, or inadequate server capacity. As servers struggle to keep up, each request takes longer to process, and latency spikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slow Database:</strong> If your database queries take too long&#8212;due to large tables, missing indexes, or poorly written queries&#8212;responses take longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inefficient Code Paths:</strong> Sometimes latency hides in the application&#8217;s code. Overly complex code, unnecessary calculations, and complicated logic can introduce small delays that add up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Congestion:</strong> Heavy network traffic, limited bandwidth, and busy intermediaries between the user and your server can slow requests. Employing techniques like load balancing across different network paths, using faster protocols (like HTTP/2 or HTTP/3), and minimizing payload sizes can help reduce the impact of congestion.</p></li></ul><h1><strong>How to Reduce Latency</strong></h1><h2>1. Caching</h2><p>Caching helps you serve common results fast. Instead of fetching data from a slower backend (like a database or remote server) every time, the system can quickly return results from a cache.</p><p>This reduces trips to the backend services and lowers user wait times.</p><h4>1.1 Client-side Caching</h4><p>Client-side caching stores data on the user's device, like in their browser. This cuts down on server requests and speeds up response times.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png" width="529" height="352.6666666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:394,&quot;width&quot;:591,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:529,&quot;bytes&quot;:25224,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke-width="1.8" stroke="#000" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M21 3V8M21 8H16M21 8L18 5.29962C16.7056 4.14183 15.1038 3.38328 13.3879 3.11547C11.6719 2.84766 9.9152 3.08203 8.32951 3.79031C6.74382 4.49858 5.39691 5.65051 4.45125 7.10715C3.5056 8.5638 3.00158 10.2629 3 11.9996M3 21V16M3 16H8M3 16L6 18.7C7.29445 19.8578 8.89623 20.6163 10.6121 20.8841C12.3281 21.152 14.0848 20.9176 15.6705 20.2093C17.2562 19.501 18.6031 18.3491 19.5487 16.8925C20.4944 15.4358 20.9984 13.7367 21 12" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></g></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Visualized using <a href="https://dub.sh/wbsMNsN">Multiplayer</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>You can cache static assets like images, JavaScript, CSS, or even API responses that rarely change.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Browser Cache:</strong> When you specify proper HTTP caching headers (e.g., <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>ETag</code>, <code>Expires</code>), the browser stores assets locally.

Latency by Proximity:</strong> Users access content from a nearby server, cutting down travel time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Offloading Traffic:</strong> With the CDN handling most static content, your main server stays less congested.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatic Failover:</strong> If one CDN server fails, others seamlessly take over, ensuring high availability.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> If your users are split between the U.S. and India, a CDN like Cloudflare or Akamai serves an image to a user in Mumbai from a local server, rather than from one in the U.S. This shorter distance means quicker load times.</p></blockquote><h2>2. Database Optimization</h2><p>The database often represents a major bottleneck. By optimizing it, you can serve data faster and reduce latency across the system.</p><h4>2.1 Optimize Queries</h4><p>Inefficient SQL queries can significantly impact performance. </p><p>Optimizing your queries by reducing their complexity and ensuring they perform only the necessary operations is crucial. </p><p>Here are some best practices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Avoid SELECT *:</strong> Fetch only the columns you need. This reduces the amount of data retrieved and improves query efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limit Joins:</strong> Excessive joins can slow down query execution. Consider precomputing or restructuring data to reduce join complexity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Batching Queries:</strong> Instead of running many small queries, batch them into a single, well-structured query.</p></li></ul><h4>2.2 Use Indexing</h4><p>Indexes act like a book&#8217;s index, allowing the database to find rows faster without scanning entire tables.</p><p>Proper use of indexing can dramatically boost query performance.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use Appropriate Indexes:</strong> Ensure that primary keys are always indexed. Additionally, create indexes on columns frequently used in <code>WHERE</code> clauses, <code>JOIN</code> conditions, or sorting operations to enhance query speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Over-Indexing:</strong> While indexes improve read performance, excessive indexing can degrade write operations due to the overhead of maintaining them.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to learn more about indexing, checkout my previous article: </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;c043489d-3b77-467a-8d8c-c71f6f361a3c&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Consider a large Book of 1000 pages.&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Database Indexes: A detailed guide&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:83602743,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ashish Pratap Singh&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Software Engineer | Prev @ Amazon.

Each shard contains only a subset of the data, reducing the load on individual servers and improving query response times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Partitioning:</strong> Partitioning involves dividing large database tables into smaller, more manageable segments. These partitions exist within the same database server but are logically separated. This simplifies query execution and enhances performance.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> If you manage a billion records, you could shard user data such that users A-M reside on one shard, and N-Z on another. This setup ensures that queries only search a fraction of the total data, significantly improving efficiency.</p></blockquote><h4>2.4 Denormalization</h4><p>While normalization reduces data duplication, it can lead to complex queries and joins. Denormalization stores duplicate data in ways that optimize read performance.</p><p>While denormalization increases storage usage, it significantly reduces the need for time-consuming joins.</p><p>This approach is particularly beneficial for read-intensive systems, such as analytics dashboards or recommendation engines, where quick data retrieval is critical.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of joining the <code>user</code> and <code>user_profile</code> tables for every query, you can store frequently accessed profile data (e.g., user name, email, or profile picture URL) directly in the <code>user</code> table. This eliminates the join operation, speeding up lookups and improving overall query performance.</p></blockquote><h2>3. Asynchronous Processing</h2><p>Not every task needs to complete before responding to the user.</p><p>Asynchronous processing moves time-consuming operations out of the critical path, allowing the system to respond to users faster.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Message Queues:</strong> Leverage tools like RabbitMQ or Kafka to handle background tasks. For example, when a user uploads a photo, the system can instantly return a success message and offload image processing to a background worker. This ensures a quick response time without delaying the user.</p></li><li><p><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> Use events to trigger background services for tasks like report generation or video encoding. These services process the events independently, preventing slow operations from impacting the user experience.</p></li></ul><h2>4. Network Optimization</h2><p>Optimizing the network path reduces the time data travels between user and server. This includes balancing loads, keeping connections alive, and shrinking payload sizes.</p><h4>4.1 Load Balancing</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

class="image-caption"><strong>Visualized using <a href="https://dub.sh/wbsMNsN">Multiplayer</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck. </p><p>With balanced loads, each server responds faster, cutting overall latency.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Load Balancing Algorithms:</strong> Common algorithms include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Round Robin:</strong> Distributes requests sequentially across servers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Least Connections:</strong> Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>IP Hash:</strong> Directs requests based on the client&#8217;s IP address, ensuring session consistency.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Load balancers continuously monitor server health. Unhealthy servers are automatically removed from the pool, ensuring uninterrupted performance for users.</p></li></ul><h4>4.2 Persistent Connections</h4><p>Establishing a new TCP or TLS connection for every request adds significant overhead. </p><p>Persistent connections enable multiple requests to share the same connection, improving efficiency and reducing latency.</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTTP Keep-Alive:</strong> Allows connections to remain open for subsequent requests instead of closing them after a single use. This eliminates the round-trip time required to establish new connections, improving response times.</p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:</strong> These advanced protocols further optimize performance by multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, allowing data to flow more efficiently and reducing latency.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> By enabling <code>Connection: keep-alive</code> in your server&#8217;s responses, clients can reuse the same connection for multiple requests, avoiding the repeated overhead of connection setup and cutting down latency caused by repeated handshakes.</p></blockquote><h4>4.3 Prefetching</h4><p>Prefetching involves anticipating what data the user might need next and fetching it ahead of time. When the user navigates, the data is already waiting.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Link Rel Prefetch:</strong> Use the <code>rel="prefetch"</code> attribute in HTML to signal to the browser which resources should be loaded in advance. This is particularly useful for preloading scripts, styles, or images that the user is likely to need next.</p></li><li><p><strong>Predictive APIs:</strong> Leverage user behavior patterns to prefetch data.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Go was designed with a focus on developer experience, and we deeply value the
feedback we receive through proposals, issues, and community interactions.
However, these channels often represent the voices of our most experienced or
engaged users, a small subset of the broader Go community. To ensure we&rsquo;re
serving developers of all skill levels, including those who may not have strong
opinions on language design, we conduct this survey once or twice a year to
gather systematic feedback and quantitative evidence. This inclusive approach
allows us to hear from a wider range of Go developers, providing valuable
insights into how Go is used across different contexts and experience levels.
Your participation is critical in informing our decisions about language changes
and resource allocation, ultimately shaping the future of Go. Thank you to
everyone who contributed, and we strongly encourage your continued participation
in future surveys. Your experience matters to us.</p>
<p>This post shares the results of our most recent Go Developer Survey, conducted
from September 9–23, 2024. We recruited participants from the Go blog and
through randomized prompts in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">VS Code</a> Go
plug-in and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GoLand IDE</a>, allowing us to recruit
a more representative sample of Go developers. We received a total of 4,156
responses. A huge thank you to all those who contributed to making this
possible.</p>
<p>Along with capturing sentiments and challenges around using Go and Go tooling,
our primary focus areas for this survey were on uncovering sources of toil,
challenges to performing best practices, and how developers are using AI
assistance.</p>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer sentiment towards Go remains extremely positive</strong>, with 93% of
survey respondents saying they felt satisfied while working with Go during the
prior year.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of deployment and an easy to use API/SDK</strong> were respondents’ favorite
things about using Go on the top three cloud providers. First-class Go support
is critical to keeping up with developer expectations.</li>
<li>70% of respondents were using AI assistants when developing with Go. The most
common uses were <strong>LLM-based code completion</strong>, writing tests, generating Go
code from natural language descriptions, and brainstorming. There was a
significant discrepancy between what respondents said they wanted to use AI
for last year, and what they currently use AI for.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge for teams using Go was <strong>maintaining consistent coding
standards</strong> across their codebase. This was often due to team members having
different levels of Go experience and coming from different programming
backgrounds, leading to inconsistencies in coding style and adoption of
non-idiomatic patterns.</li>

<h3 id="sentiment">Overall satisfaction</h3>
<p>Overall satisfaction remains high in the survey with 93% of respondents saying
they were somewhat or very satisfied with Go during the last year. Although the
exact percentages fluctuate slightly from cycle to cycle, we do not see any
statistically significant differences from our <a href="/blog/survey2023-h2-results">2023
H2</a> or <a href="/blog/survey2024-h1-results">2024 H1
</a>Surveys when the satisfaction rate
was 90% and 93%, respectively.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/csat.svg" alt="Chart of developer satisfaction with Go"
class="chart" /></p>
<p>The open comments we received on the survey continue to highlight what
developers like most about using Go, for example, its simplicity, the Go
toolchain, and its promise of backwards compatibility:</p>
<p><em>“I am a programming languages enjoyer (C-like) and I always come back to Go for
its simplicity, fast compilation and robust toolchain. Keep it up!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Thank you for creating Go! It is my favorite language, because it is pretty
minimal, the development cycle has rapid build-test cycles, and when using a
random open source project written in Go, there is a good chance that it will
work, even 10 years after. I love the 1.0 compatibility guarantee.”</em></p>
<h3 id="devenv">Development environments and tools</h3>
<h4 id="developer-os">Developer OS</h4>
<p>Consistent with previous years, most survey respondents develop with Go on Linux
(61%) and macOS (59%) systems. Historically, the proportion of Linux and macOS
users has been very close, and we didn’t see any significant changes from the
last survey. The randomly sampled groups from JetBrains and VS Code were more
likely (33% and 36%, respectively) to develop on Windows than the self-selected
group (16%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/os_dev.svg" alt="Chart of operating systems respondents
use when developing Go software" class="chart" /> <img
src="survey2024h2/os_dev_src.svg" alt="Chart of operating systems respondents
use when developing Go software, split by difference sample sources"
class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="deployment-environments">Deployment environments</h4>
<p>Given the prevalence of Go for cloud development and containerized workloads,
it’s no surprise that Go developers primarily deploy to Linux environments
(96%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/os_deploy.svg" alt="Chart of operating systems
respondents deploy to when developing Go software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We included several questions to understand what architectures respondents are
deploying to when deploying to Linux, Windows or WebAssembly. The x86-64 /
AMD64 architecture was by far the most popular choice for those deploying to
both Linux (92%) and Windows (97%). ARM64 was second at 49% for Linux and 21%
for Windows.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/arch_linux.svg" alt="Linux architecture usage"
class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/arch_win.svg" alt="Windows architecture
usage" class="chart" /></p>
<p>Not many respondents deployed to Web Assembly (only about 4% of overall
respondents), but 73% that do said they deploy to JS and 48% to WASI Preview 1.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/arch_wa.svg" alt="Web assembly architecture usage"
class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="editor-awareness-and-preferences">Editor awareness and preferences</h4>
<p>We introduced a new question on this survey to assess awareness and usage of
popular editors for Go. When interpreting these results, keep in mind that 34%
of respondents came to the survey from VS Code and 9% of respondents came from
GoLand, so it is more likely for them to use those editors regularly.</p>
<p>VS Code was the most widely used editor, with 66% of respondents using it
regularly, and GoLand was the second most used at 35%. Almost all respondents
had heard of both VS Code and GoLand, but respondents were much more likely to
have at least tried VS Code. Interestingly, 33% of respondents said they
regularly use 2 or more editors. They may use different editors for different
tasks or environments, such as using Emacs or Vim via SSH, where IDEs aren’t
available.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/editor_aware.svg" alt="Level of familiarity with each
editor" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We also asked a question about editor preference, the same as we have asked on
previous surveys. Because our randomly sampled populations were recruited from
within VS Code or GoLand, they are strongly biased towards preferring those
editors. To avoid skewing the results, we show the data for the most preferred
editor here from the self-selected group only. 38% preferred VS Code and 35%
preferred GoLand. This is a notable difference from the last survey in H1, when
43% preferred VS Code and 33% preferred GoLand. A possible explanation could be
in how respondents were recruited this year. This year the VS Code notification
began inviting developers to take the survey before the Go blog entry was
posted, so a larger proportion of respondents came from the VS Code prompt this
year who might have otherwise come from the blog post. Because we only show the
self-selected respondents in this chart, data from respondents from the VS Code
prompt data are not represented here. Another contributing factor could be the
slight increase in those who prefer &ldquo;Other&rdquo; (4%). The write-in responses suggest
there is increased interest in editors like <a href="https://zed.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Zed</a>, which made
up 43% of the write-in responses.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/editor.svg" alt="Code editors respondents most prefer to
use with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="code-analysis-tools">Code analysis tools</h4>
<p>The most popular code analysis tool was <code>gopls</code>, which was knowingly used by 65%
of respondents. Because <code>gopls</code> is used under-the-hood by default in VS Code,
this is likely an undercount. Following closely behind, <code>golangci-lint</code> was used
by 57% of respondents, and <code>staticcheck</code> was used by 34% of respondents. A much
smaller proportion used custom or other tools, which suggests that most
respondents prefer common established tools over custom solutions. Only 10% of
respondents indicated they don&rsquo;t use any code analysis tools.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/code_analysis.svg" alt="Code analysis tools respondents
use with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="cloud">Go in the Clouds</h4>
<p>Go is a popular language for modern cloud-based development, so we typically
include survey questions to help us understand which cloud platforms and
services Go developers are using. In this cycle, we sought to learn about
preferences and experiences of Go developers across cloud providers, with a
particular focus on the largest cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. We also included an additional option for
“Bare Metal Servers” for those who deploy to servers without virtualization.</p>
<p>Similar to previous years, almost half of respondents (50%) deploy Go programs
to Amazon Web Services. AWS is followed by self-owned or company-owned servers
(37%), and Google Cloud (30%). Respondents who work at large organizations are a
little more likely to deploy to self-owned or company-owned servers (48%) than
those who work at small-to-medium organizations (34%). They‘re also a little
more likely to deploy to Microsoft Azure (25%) than small-to-medium
organizations (12%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/cloud_platform.svg" alt="Cloud providers where
respondents deploy Go software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>The most commonly used cloud services were AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (41%),
AWS EC2 (39%), and Google Cloud GKE (29%). Although we’ve seen Kubernetes usage
increase over time, this is the first time we’ve seen EKS become more widely
used than EC2. Overall, Kubernetes offerings were the most popular services for
AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, followed by VMs and then Serverless offerings.
Go&rsquo;s strengths in containerization and microservices development naturally align
with the rising popularity of Kubernetes, as it provides an efficient and
scalable platform for deploying and managing these types of applications.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/cloud_service.svg" alt="Cloud platforms where respondents
deploy Go software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We asked a followup question to respondents who deployed Go code to the top
three cloud providers, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure on
what they like most about deploying Go code to each cloud. The most popular
response across different providers was actually Go&rsquo;s performance and language
features rather than something about the cloud provider.</p>
<p>Other common reasons were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with the given cloud provider compared to other clouds</li>
<li>Ease of deployment of Go applications on the given cloud provider</li>
<li>The cloud provider&rsquo;s API/SDK for Go is easy to use</li>
<li>The API/SDK is well documented</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than familiarity, the top favorite things highlight the importance of
having first class support for Go to keep up with developer expectations.</p>
<p>It was also fairly common for respondents to say they don&rsquo;t have a favorite
thing about their cloud provider. From a previous version of the survey that
involved write-in responses, this often meant that they did not interact
directly with the Cloud. In particular, respondents who use Microsoft Azure were
much more likely to say that “Nothing” was their favorite thing (51%) compared
to AWS (27%) or Google Cloud (30%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/cloud_fave_all.svg" alt= "What respondents liked most
about each of the top 3 Clouds" class="chart" /></p>
<h3 id="ai-assistance">AI assistance</h3>
<p>The Go team hypothesizes that AI assistance has the potential to alleviate
developers from tedious and repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more
creative and fulfilling aspects of their work. To gain insights into areas where
AI assistance could be most beneficial, we included a section in our survey to
identify common developer toil.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (70%) are using AI assistants when developing with
Go. The most common usage of AI assistants was in LLM-based code completion
(35%). Other common responses were writing tests (29%), generating Go code from
a natural language description (27%), and brainstorming ideas (25%). There was
also a sizable minority (30%) of respondents who had not used any LLM for
assistance in the last month.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks.svg" alt= "Most common tasks used with AI
assistance" class="chart" /></p>
<p>Some of these results stood out when compared to findings from our 2023 H2
survey, where we asked respondents for the top 5 use cases they would like to
see AI/ML support Go developers. Although a couple new responses were introduced
in the current survey, we can still do a rough comparison between what
respondents said they wanted AI support for, and what their actual usage was
like. In that previous survey, writing tests was the most desired use case
(49%). In our latest 2024 H2 survey, about 29% of respondents had used AI
assistants for this in the last month. This suggests that current offerings are
not meeting developer needs for writing tests. Similarly, in 2023, 47%
respondents said they would like suggestions for best practices while coding,
while only 14% a year later said they are using AI assistance for this use case.
46% said they wanted help catching common mistakes while coding, and only 13%
said they were using AI assistance for this. This could indicate that current AI
assistants are not well-equipped for these kinds of tasks, or they&rsquo;re not well
integrated into developer workflows or tooling.</p>
<p>It was also surprising to see such high usage of AI for generating Go code from
natural language and brainstorming, since the previous survey didn&rsquo;t indicate
these as highly desired use cases. There could be a number of explanations for
these differences. While previous respondents might not have explicitly <em>wanted</em>
AI for code generation or brainstorming initially, they might be gravitating
towards these uses because they align with the current strengths of generative
AI—natural language processing and creative text generation. We should also keep
in mind that people<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-rule-of-usability-dont-listen-to-users/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> are not necessarily the best predictors of their own
behavior</a>.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks_yoy.svg" alt= "Tasks used AI assistance
in 2024 compared to those wanted in 2023" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We also saw some notable differences in how different groups responded to this
question. Respondents at small to medium sized organizations were a little more
likely to have used LLMs (75%) compared to those at large organizations (66%).
There could be a number of reasons why, for example, larger organizations may
have stricter security and compliance requirements and concerns about the
security of LLM coding assistants, the potential for data leakage, or compliance
with industry-specific regulations. They also may have already invested in
other developer tools and practices that already provide similar benefits to
developer productivity.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks_org.svg" alt= "Most common tasks used
with AI assistance by org size" class="chart" /></p>
<p>Go developers with less than 2 years of experience were more likely to use AI
assistants (75%) compared to Go developers with 5+ years of experience (67%).
Less experienced Go developers were also more likely to use them for more tasks,
on average 3.50. Although all experience levels tended to use LLM-based code
completion, less experienced Go developers were more likely to use Go for more
tasks related to learning and debugging, such as explaining what a piece of Go
code does, resolving compiler errors and debugging failures in their Go code.
This suggests that AI assistants are currently providing the greatest utility to
those who are less familiar with Go. We don&rsquo;t know how AI assistants affect
learning or getting started on a new Go project, something we want to
investigate in the future. However, all experience levels had similar rates of
satisfaction with their AI assistants, around 73%, so new Go developers are not
more satisfied with AI assistants, despite using them more often.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks_exp.svg" alt= "Most common tasks used
with AI assistance by experience with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<p>To respondents who reported using AI assistance for at least one task related to
writing Go code, we asked some follow up questions to learn more about their AI
assistant usage. The most commonly used AI assistants were ChatGPT (68%) and
GitHub Copilot (50%). When asked which AI assistant they used <em>most</em> in the last
month, ChatGPT and Copilot were about even at 36% each, so although more
respondents used ChatGPT, it wasn’t necessarily their primary assistant.
Participants were similarly satisfied with both tools (73% satisfied with
ChatGPT, vs. 78% with GitHub CoPilot). The highest satisfaction rate for any AI
assistant was Anthropic Claude, at 87%.</p>

assistants used" class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/ai_primary.svg" alt=
"Most common primary AI assistants used" class="chart" /></p>
<h3 id="team-challenges">Challenges for teams using Go</h3>
<p>In this section of the survey, we wanted to understand which best practices or
tools should be better integrated into developer workflows. Our approach was to
identify common problems for teams using Go. We then asked respondents which
challenges would bring them the most benefit if they were “magically” solved for
them. (This was so that respondents would not focus on particular solutions.)
Common problems that would provide the most benefit if they were solved would be
considered candidates for improvement.</p>
<p>The most commonly reported challenges for teams were maintaining consistent coding
standards across our Go codebase (58%), identifying performance issues in a
running Go program (58%) and identifying resource usage inefficiencies in a
running Go program (57%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_challenges.svg" alt= "Most common challenges for
teams" class="chart" /></p>
<p>21% of respondents said their team would benefit most from maintaining
consistent coding standards across their Go codebase. This was the most common
response, making it a good candidate to address. In a follow-up question, we got
more details as to why specifically this was so challenging.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_challenges_most_benefit.svg" alt= "Most benefit to
solve" class="chart" /></p>
<p>According to the write-in responses, many teams face challenges maintaining
consistent coding standards because their members have varying levels of
experience with Go and come from different programming backgrounds. This led to
inconsistencies in coding style and the adoption of non-idiomatic patterns.</p>
<p><em>“There&rsquo;s lots of polyglot engineers where I work. So the Go written is not
consistent. I do consider myself a Gopher and spend time trying to convince my
teammates what is idiomatic in Go”—Go developer with 2–4 years of experience.</em></p>
<p><em>“Most of the team members are learning Go from scratch. Coming from the
dynamically typed languages, it takes them a while to get used to the new
language. They seem to struggle maintaining the code consistency following the
Go guidelines.”—Go developer with 2–4 years of experience.</em></p>
<p>This echoes some feedback we’ve heard before about teammates who write &ldquo;Gava&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Guby&rdquo; due to their previous language experiences. Although static analysis was
a class of tool we had in mind to address this issue when we came up with this
question, we are currently exploring different ways we might address this.</p>
<h3 id="simd">Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)</h3>
<p>SIMD, or Single Instruction, Multiple Data, is a type of parallel processing
that allows a single CPU instruction to operate on multiple data points
simultaneously. This facilitates tasks involving large datasets and repetitive
operations, and is often used to optimize performance in fields like game
development, data processing, and scientific computing. In this section of the
survey we wanted to assess respondents&rsquo; needs for native SIMD support in Go.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (89%) say that work on projects where performance
optimizations are crucial at least some of the time. 40% said they work on such
projects at least half the time. This held true across different organization
sizes and experience levels, suggesting that performance is an important issue
for most developers.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/perf_freq.svg" alt= "How often respondents work on
performance critical software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>About half of respondents (54%), said they are at least a little familiar with
the concept of SIMD. Working with SIMD often requires a deeper understanding of
computer architecture and low-level programming concepts, so unsurprisingly we
find that less experienced developers were less likely to be familiar with SIMD.
Respondents with more experience and who worked on performance-crucial
applications at least half the time were the most likely to be familiar with
SIMD.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/simd_fam.svg" alt= "Familiarity with SIMD" class="chart"
/></p>
<p>For those who were at least slightly familiar with SIMD, we asked some follow
-up questions to understand how respondents were affected by the absence of
native SIMD support in Go. Over a third, about 37%, said they had been impacted.
17% of respondents said they had been limited in the performance they could
achieve in their projects, 15% said they had to use another language instead of
Go to achieve their goals, and 13% said they had to use non-Go libraries when
they would have preferred to use Go libraries. Interestingly, respondents who
were negatively impacted by the absence of native SIMD support were a little
more likely to use Go for data processing and AI/ML. This suggests that adding
SIMD support could make Go a better option for these domains.</p>

for SIMD" class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/what_simd_impact.svg" alt=
"What impacted respondents build with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<h3 id="demographics">Demographics</h3>
<p>We ask similar demographic questions during each cycle of this survey so we can
understand how comparable the year-over-year results may be. For example, if we
saw changes in who responded to the survey in terms of Go experience, it’d be
very likely that other differences in results from prior cycles were due to this
demographic shift. We also use these questions to provide comparisons between
groups, such as satisfaction according to how long respondents have been using
Go.</p>
<p>We didn’t see any significant changes in levels of experience among respondents
during this cycle.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/go_exp.svg" alt= "Experience levels of respondents"
class="chart" /></p>
<p>There are differences in the demographics of respondents according to whether
they came from The Go Blog, the VS Code extension, or GoLand. The population
who responded to survey notifications in VS Code skews toward less experience
with Go; we suspect this a reflection of VS Code’s popularity with new Go
developers, who may not be ready to invest in an IDE license while they’re still
learning. With respect to years of Go experience, the respondents randomly
selected from GoLand are more similar to our self-selected population who found
the survey through the Go Blog. Seeing consistencies between samples allows us
to more confidently generalize findings to the rest of the community.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/go_exp_src.svg" alt= "Experience with Go by survey
source" class="chart" /></p>
<p>In addition to years of experience with Go, we also measured years of
professional coding experience. Our audience tends to be a pretty experienced
bunch, with 26% of respondents having 16 or more years of professional coding
experience.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_exp.svg" alt= "Overall levels of professional
developer experience" class="chart" /></p>
<p>The self-selected group was even more experienced than the randomly selected
groups, with 29% having 16 or more years of professional experience. This
suggests that our self-selected group is generally more experienced than our
randomly selected groups and can help explain some of the differences we see in
this group.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_exp_src.svg" alt= "Levels of professional developer
experience by survey source" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We found that 81% of respondents were fully employed. When we look at our
individual samples, we see a small but significant difference within our
respondents from VS Code, who are slightly more likely to be students. This
makes sense given that VS Code is free.</p>
<img src="survey2024h2/employment.svg" alt= "Employment status" class="chart" />
<img src="survey2024h2/employment_src.svg" alt= "Employment status by survey
source" class="chart" />
<p>Similar to previous years, the most common use cases for Go were API/RPC
services (75%) and command line tools (62%). More experienced Go developers
reported building a wider variety of applications in Go. This trend was
consistent across every category of app or service. We did not find any notable
differences in what respondents are building based on their organization size.
Respondents from the random VS Code and GoLand samples did not display
significant differences either.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/what.svg" alt= "What respondents build with Go"
class="chart" /></p>
<h3 id="firmographics">Firmographics</h3>
<p>We heard from respondents at a variety of different organizations. About 29%
worked at large organizations with 1,001 or more employees, 25% were from
midsize organizations of 101–1,000 employees, and 43% worked at smaller
organizations with fewer than 100 employees. As in previous years, the most
common industry people work in was technology (43%) while the second most common
was financial services (13%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/org_size.svg" alt= "Organization sizes where respondents
work" class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/industry.svg" alt= "Industries
respondents work in" class="chart" /></p>
<p>As in previous surveys, the most common location for survey respondents was the
United States (19%). This year we saw a significant shift in the proportion of
respondents coming from Ukraine, from 1% to 6%, making it the third most common
location for survey respondents. Because we only saw this difference among our
self-selected respondents, and not in the randomly sampled groups, this suggests
that something affected who discovered the survey, rather than a widespread
increase in Go adoption across all developers in Ukraine. Perhaps there was
increased visibility or awareness of the survey or the Go Blog among developers
in Ukraine.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/location.svg" alt= "Where respondents are located"
class="chart" /></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>We announce the survey primarily through the Go Blog, where it is often picked
up on various social channels like Reddit, or Hacker News. We also recruit
respondents by using the VS Code Go plugin to randomly select users to whom we show
a prompt asking if they’d like to participate in the survey. With some help from
our friends at JetBrains, we also have an additional random sample from
prompting a random subset of GoLand users to take the survey. This gave us two
sources we used to compare the self-selected respondents from our traditional
channels and help identify potential effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">self-selection
bias</a>.</p>
<p>57% of survey respondents “self-selected” to take the survey, meaning they found
it on the Go blog or other social Go channels. People who don’t follow these
channels are less likely to learn about the survey from them, and in some cases,
they respond differently than people who do closely follow them. For example,
they might be new to the Go community and not yet aware of the Go blog. About
43% of respondents were randomly sampled, meaning they responded to the survey
after seeing a prompt in VS Code (25%) or GoLand (11%). Over the period of
September 9–23, 2024, there was roughly a 10% chance users of the VS Code plugin
would have seen this prompt. The prompt in GoLand was similarly active between
September 9–20. By examining how the randomly sampled groups differ from the
self-selected responses, as well as from each other, we’re able to more
confidently generalize findings to the larger community of Go developers.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/source.svg" alt="Chart of different sources of survey
respondents" class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="how-to-read-these-results">How to read these results</h4>
<p>Throughout this report we use charts of survey responses to provide supporting
evidence for our findings. All of these charts use a similar format. The title
is the exact question that survey respondents saw. Unless otherwise noted,
questions were multiple choice and participants could only select a single
response choice; each chart’s subtitle will tell the reader if the question
allowed multiple response choices or was an open-ended text box instead of a
multiple choice question. For charts of open-ended text responses, a Go team
member read and manually categorized all of the responses. Many open-ended
questions elicited a wide variety of responses; to keep the chart sizes
reasonable, we condensed them to a maximum of the top 10-12 themes, with
additional themes all grouped under “Other”. The percentage labels shown in
charts are rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 1.4% and 0.8% will both be
displayed as 1%), but the length of each bar and row ordering are based on the
unrounded values.</p>
<p>To help readers understand the weight of evidence underlying each finding, we
included error bars showing the 95% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">confidence
interval</a> for responses;
narrower bars indicate increased confidence. Sometimes two or more responses
have overlapping error bars, which means the relative order of those responses
is not statistically meaningful (i.e., the responses are effectively tied). The
lower right of each chart shows the number of people whose responses are
included in the chart, in the form “n = [number of respondents]”. In cases where
we found interesting differences in responses between groups, (e.g., years of
experience, organization size, or sample source) we showed a color-coded
breakdown of the differences.</p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p>Thanks for reviewing our semi-annual Go Developer Survey! And many thanks to
everyone who shared their thoughts on Go and everyone who contributed to making
this survey happen. It means the world to us and truly helps us improve Go.</p>

A Maintainer's Odyssey: Time, Technology, and Transformation - Sayan Chowdhury, Flatcar

This talk takes you through the journey of Flatcar Container Linux from the eyes of a maintainer. What began as a "friendly fork" of CoreOS Container Linux has grown into a robust, independent, container-optimized Linux OS. The journey kicked off with a red CI dashboard daunting to many, almost-zero platform support, an unstructured release pipeline, a mammoth list of outdated packages, missing support for ARM architecture and more -- hardly a foundation for future initiatives atop. Over the years, countless human hours have been dedicated to transforming Flatcar, and I plan to discuss the initiatives we have undertaken, the war stories along the way, and the lessons we have learned as a team. The talk will also cover how we embrace new innovations and challenges while contributing back to the community. Attendees will gain insight into the challenges and rewards of maintaining a fast-moving Linux distribution and discover avenues to contribute to the Flatcar ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Day in the Life of Kubernetes Release with Tools, Challenges, and Operations - Subhasmita Swain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIEaoz9wcRE</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:13:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

A Day in the Life of Kubernetes Release with Tools, Challenges, and Operations - Subhasmita Swain, SIG Release

Anyone working with Kubernetes knows how hard it is to put out a Kubernetes release. But actually, how are releases cut? This talk is for cloud-native practitioners who care about the environmental impact of their work. Focusing on insight into daily life, the tools, and the methodologies, the release engineers have a strong identity of the ecological consideration at every step.

We'll explore key aspects such as the automation tools that streamline the release process, the challenges of ensuring efficient resource usage, and the design principles that promote sustainability. Through practical demonstrations, we'll showcase best practices like optimizing CI/CD pipelines and leveraging containerization for minimal resource consumption. Participants will be equipped with actionable knowledge to enhance the sustainability of their Kubernetes releases. The key takeaway would be how the existing tools could be adapted and shared by more of the project, like image promoters.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>containerd Packaging: Who Should Ship and How? - Akhil Mohan, containerd</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrEFji9AkiQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:13:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

containerd Packaging: Who Should Ship and How? - Akhil Mohan, containerd

When it comes to packaging and distributing containerd, there’s always a confusion that arises from time to time: should we ship it ourselves or rely on vendors? While vendor distribution can be convenient, there can be surprising issues too. Another question arises: should we package other dependencies together with official release to ensure consistency? These considerations bring up a bigger discussion about best practices for distribution and packaging. We will be discussing perks and pitfalls of the different approaches to distributing core components in cloud native ecosystem like containerd and runc. Insights into how other projects handle their distribution could provide a valuable direction forward for the wider community. We also take a peek into the testing infrastructure that containerd uses to guarantee what we distribute is rock solid.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hands-On Chaos Engineering Workshop with LitmusChaos and the Road to CNCF Graduation - Panel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCUnSpTvCt0</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 18:13:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

The Hitchhiker's Guide to Testing Kubernetes - Sreeram Venkitesh, SIG Testing

A vital part of contributing to Kubernetes is testing. Reading existing tests lets you understand how a particular component works. You're also expected to write tests when making changes to the code base. The K8s codebase has different kinds of tests like unit, end to end and conformance tests. Given the scale of K8s, all of these are important to make sure that a feature works as intended and no edge cases come up when all the components are deployed in a production environment.

If you're getting started with contributing to K8s, learning the entire testing infrastructure can be overwhelming. This talk aims to give an introduction of the different types of tests in K8s and how you can setup your dev environment to run them locally. Along with unit tests, the talk also aims to give a demo of setting up tools like kubetest2 and hydrophone to run e2e and conformance tests with a kind cluster. After the talk you'll be ready to write your own tests for K8s and improve the test coverage.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside a Syrian Prison: A Producer’s Unexpected Personal Discovery | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rzllGp5Sn8</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:00:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bashar al-Assad’s downfall in Syria has given families of Syrian detainees hope that they escaped the regime’s prisons.

While CPUs continue to accelerate, I/O operations remain bottlenecked by system call overhead, memory copy inefficiencies, and latency introduced by traditional synchronous models. For high-performance computing workloads, storage systems, and networking, this gap directly impacts scalability.</p><p>io_uring, introduced in Linux Kernel 5.1 by Jens Axboe, modernizes asynchronous I/O by eliminating unnecessary context switches, batching system calls, and enabling zero-copy operations between kernel and user space. Unlike its predecessors (epoll, linux-aio), io_uring achieves true zero-copy I/O between kernel and user space. This design is highly scalable, capable of handling millions of I/O operations per second while keeping CPU overhead minimal.</p><p>This article provides an exploration of io_uring, covering its architecture, core principles and practical usage.</p><h3>Who Should Use io_uring?</h3><p>io_uring is ideal for developers and engineers building applications requiring high-throughput, low-latency I/O. Its key beneficiaries include:</p><ul><li><strong>High-performance storage systems</strong>: Databases, filesystems, and analytics engines processing massive I/O workloads.</li><li><strong>Networking applications</strong>: Systems requiring low-latency and high-throughput socket I/O.</li><li><strong>High-performance computing (HPC)</strong>: Compute-intensive tasks requiring data pipelines optimized for minimal I/O stalls.</li><li><strong>Event-driven architectures</strong>: Software looking to unify I/O without thread pools or polling bottlenecks.</li></ul><p>In essence, any application where system call overhead, memory inefficiency, or scalability issues limit performance can benefit from io_uring.</p><h3>Context: Limitations of Existing I/O Models</h3><p>The foundational Linux I/O system calls — read, write, and their variants—are synchronous. They block execution until data is transferred, introducing latency and hindering concurrency in high-throughput applications. To achieve concurrency, applications often rely on thread pools or user-space scheduling, both of which come with their own complexities and inefficiencies.</p><p>Interfaces like select, poll, and epoll monitor file descriptors for readiness, allowing non-blocking operation on sockets. However, these interfaces do not work efficiently for file-based I/O and require additional system calls for data transfer.</p><p>Linux AIO (linux-aio) offered an asynchronous interface but suffered from several limitations:</p><ul><li>It supported only unbuffered (O_DIRECT) files, making it unsuitable for general-purpose applications.</li><li>Submissions could still block when accessing file metadata.</li><li>It lacked extensibility and struggled to integrate modern requirements like low-latency networking.</li></ul><h4>BSD and macOS I/O Models</h4><p>FreeBSD, by contrast, has <strong>kqueue</strong>, which provides an event notification mechanism for both sockets and files. macOS uses a similar interface since kqueue originated in BSD. While powerful, these interfaces still rely on readiness checks and require additional system calls to process I/O.</p><p>While OpenBSD enhances kqueue for predictability and reliability, its limitations persist. In contrast, io_uring reduces system call overhead and improves scalability, making it better suited for high-throughput workloads.</p><h4>Windows’ IOCP and Asynchronous Roots</h4><ul><li><strong>IOCP</strong> (I/O Completion Ports): Windows’ asynchronous I/O mechanism predates Linux solutions by decades. It delivers performance but lacks batching and zero-copy operations.</li><li><strong>I/O Rings</strong>: Recent Windows kernels now introduce IORING for improved capabilities, though they remain in early stages relative to io_uring.</li></ul><p>Unix systems historically avoided asynchronous I/O due to perceived complexity. Systems like VMS implemented efficient I/O decades earlier, influencing Windows NT’s IOCP. Legal concerns between Microsoft and DEC further stalled Unix advancements.</p><h3>Design: Ring Buffers and System Calls</h3><p>At its core, io_uring uses <strong>two shared-memory ring buffers</strong> to eliminate repeated syscalls:</p><ol><li><strong>Submission Queue (SQ)</strong>: User-space enqueues I/O requests.</li><li><strong>Completion Queue (CQ)</strong>: Kernel posts I/O completion results.</li></ol><p>Unlike epoll, where event readiness still requires polling, io_uring enables direct notification and retrieval through memory-mapped rings.</p><h4>Submission Queue (SQ)</h4><p>The SQ contains indices referencing <strong>Submission Queue Entries (SQEs)</strong>, which describe the I/O requests. Each SQE specifies the operation type, file descriptor, buffer, and other parameters. After filling in an SQE, the application pushes its index to the SQ ring, notifying the kernel to process it.</p><h4>Completion Queue (CQ)</h4><p>Once the kernel completes an I/O operation, it places the result in the CQ. The application consumes the results by reading from the CQ ring without making an additional system call.</p><p>By decoupling submission and completion, io_uring achieves asynchronous operation without blocking the application thread.</p><p>io_uring relies on a minimal set of system calls:</p><ul><li><strong>io_uring_setup</strong>: Initializes the io_uring instance.</li><li><strong>io_uring_enter</strong>: Submits SQEs to the kernel and optionally waits for completions.</li><li><strong>io_uring_register</strong>: Registers buffers, file descriptors, and other resources for efficient reuse.</li></ul><h3>Practical Usage of io_uring</h3><p>For higher-level languages like <strong>Go</strong>, accessing io_uring typically involves libraries or bindings that wrap the underlying C interface.</p><h4>Steps to Use io_uring</h4><ol><li><strong>Initialization</strong>: The application sets up the io_uring instance, mapping the SQ, CQ, and SQE array into user-space memory.</li><li><strong>Batch Submission</strong>: I/O requests are added to the SQE array and indexed in the SQ ring.</li><li><strong>Kernel Notification</strong>: A call to io_uring_enter submits the queued requests.</li><li><strong>Completion Handling</strong>: The application polls the CQ ring for results and processes completed operations.</li></ol><p>Using io_uring removes the need for thread pools, readiness checks, and blocking system calls, making it a natural fit for event-loop architectures. Advanced io_uring features further enhance performance and flexibility:</p><ul><li><strong>Fixed Buffers and Files</strong>: Pre-register buffers to reduce mapping overhead.</li><li><strong>Linked Operations</strong>: Chain SQEs with IOSQE_IO_LINK for atomic, dependent tasks.</li><li><strong>Timeout Support</strong>: Manage operation expirations via IORING_OP_TIMEOUT.</li></ul><h3>io_uring and High-Performance Computing (HPC)</h3><p>In HPC environments, where <a href="https://medium.com/@kyodo-tech/6ec8340c38e9"><strong>I/O performance directly affects overall throughput</strong></a> , io_uring offers several critical benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduced Data Motion</strong>: Zero-copy operations minimize CPU involvement in memory transfers, improving energy efficiency and bandwidth utilization.</li><li><strong>Batch Submission</strong>: I/O requests are submitted in batches, reducing kernel-user transitions.</li><li><strong>Polling for Ultra-Low Latency</strong>: Kernel-side polling (SQPOLL) eliminates interrupt delays for storage and networking devices.</li><li><strong>Low-Latency File and Socket I/O</strong>: For HPC tasks involving storage access (e.g., checkpointing, data persistence) or real-time networking, io_uring’s batched submission and completion handling reduce syscall-induced latency.</li><li><strong>High IOPS Scalability</strong>: io_uring efficiently handles millions of I/O operations per second, scaling well on multi-core processors.</li></ul><p>These features allow HPC systems to bridge the gap between CPU performance and I/O bandwidth.</p><h3>Performance Considerations</h3><p>Benchmarking io_uring reveals measurable improvements over existing I/O models. For storage workloads using Direct I/O, it achieves nearly <strong>twice the throughput</strong> of synchronous reads and POSIX AIO while reducing context switch overhead.</p><p>For buffered I/O workloads (e.g., accessing the page cache), io_uring matches the performance of synchronous reads without blocking or requiring thread pools.</p><h4>io_uring in Containerized Environments</h4><p>In containerized environments, such as Kubernetes, io_uring requires additional consideration of the deployment architecture. Containerization introduces abstraction layers—such as overlay filesystems and distributed storage—that can hinder the direct performance benefits.</p><p>Kubernetes distributions should be paired with direct storage mechanisms such as hostPath volumes or raw block device mounts to preserve performance advantages. Running containers in privileged mode or with elevated capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can be beneficial, as io_uring relies on advanced kernel features that may be restricted in default Kubernetes environments. Privileged mode ensures the container can access necessary low-level system functions, bypass namespace isolation overhead, and directly interact with host storage devices, enabling io_uring to deliver its intended performance benefits. This makes io_uring viable even within orchestrated workloads, particularly for high-throughput and latency-sensitive applications.</p><h3>Comparative Landscape</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IYmTME7XFZoyfWfVE5IEnQ.png" /></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Compared to alternatives like kqueue on BSD systems, io_uring delivers superior scalability and flexibility. As tooling and libraries continue to evolve, io_uring will become the de-facto standard for performance-critical I/O on Linux.</p><p>Developers seeking to maximize modern hardware performance will find io_uring a clean, efficient, and scalable solution to today’s I/O bottlenecks.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=047d5b1a9944" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Vulkan Graphics API with Tom Olson and Ralph Potter</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/12/19/the-vulkan-graphics-api-with-tom-olson-and-ralph-potter/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-vulkan-graphics-api-with-tom-olson-and-ralph-potter</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>ncus and Docker both use Linux kernel features to containerize your applications. Incus is best suited when you need system-level containers that act like traditional VMs and provide a persistent developer experience. On the other hand, Docker containers are ephemeral, i.e., temporary in nature. All files created inside Docker containers are lost when your Docker container is stopped or removed unless you stored them using volumes in different directories outside Docker. Docker is created as a disposable app deployment system. Incus containers are not typically created as disposables, and data is kept inside when they are stopped. Because of the Linux kernel support nesting feature, you can run Docker inside Incus. This page explains how to run Docker inside Incus containers.</p>

<p>Volume group snapshots were <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/08/kubernetes-1-27-volume-group-snapshot-alpha/">introduced</a>
as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release.
The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to <strong>beta</strong>.
The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of
<a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/group-snapshot-restore-feature.html#volume-group-snapshot-apis">extension APIs for group snapshots</a>.
These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes.
Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims
for snapshotting.
A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and
recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.</p>
<p>This new feature is only supported for <a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/">CSI</a> volume drivers.</p>
<h2 id="an-overview-of-volume-group-snapshots">An overview of volume group snapshots</h2>
<p>Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents <em>copies</em> made from multiple volumes, that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>
<h2 id="why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that
automates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block
and file storage.</p>
<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:
Kubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and
underlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the
cluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>
<p>There was already a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/">VolumeSnapshot</a> API
that provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against
data loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities
not covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>
<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be
taken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.
This can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,
an application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.
If snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,
the application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored
from those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from
each volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the
application after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get
application consistent snapshots.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently,
or it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all.
For example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce
and nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which
provides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-apis-for-volume-group-snapshots">Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots</h2>
<p>Kubernetes' support for <em>volume group snapshots</em> relies on three API kinds that
are used
for managing snapshots:</p>
<dl>
<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshot</dt>
<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request
creation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.
It contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the
timestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.
The creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a
cluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>
<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</dt>
<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.
It contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group
snapshot ID.
This object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).
The VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it
was created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>
<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</dt>
<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be
created, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These three API kinds are defined as
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">CustomResourceDefinitions</a>
(CRDs).
These CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support
volume group snapshots.</p>
<h2 id="what-components-are-needed-to-support-volume-group-snapshots">What components are needed to support volume group snapshots</h2>
<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter">external-snapshotter</a> repository.
Implementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>
<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>
<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per
cluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors
bundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part
of their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new-in-beta">What's new in Beta?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.11.0">v1.11.0 release</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed.
Most of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs.
Minimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules.
One thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating
multiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes
for the same CSI driver.
With the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically
provisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot
classes or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>enable-volumegroup-snapshot</code> flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter
sidecar has been replaced by a feature gate.
Since VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is
disabled by default.
To use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag <code>--feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true</code>
when starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual
VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common
snapshot-controller.
New RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from
the CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots">How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots</h2>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>
<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to
snapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot
object.</p>
<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot
should be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent
should be used.</p>
<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator.
It contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which
is available for use by cluster users.</p>
<p>One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>selector</code> - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped
together for snapshotting. This selector will be used to match the label
added to a PVC.</li>
<li><code>volumeGroupSnapshotContentName</code> - specifies the name of a pre-existing
VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object representing an existing volume group snapshot.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dynamically-provision-a-group-snapshot">Dynamically provision a group snapshot</h4>

<p>To implement the volume group snapshot feature, a CSI driver <strong>must</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a new group controller service.</li>
<li>Implement group controller RPCs: <code>CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>, <code>DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>, and <code>GetVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>.</li>
<li>Add group controller capability <code>CREATE_DELETE_GET_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOT</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md">CSI spec</a>
and the <a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/">Kubernetes-CSI Driver Developer Guide</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it is strongly recommended that Kubernetes distributors
bundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part
of their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>
<p>As part of this recommended deployment process, the Kubernetes team provides a number of
sidecar (helper) containers, including the
<a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/external-snapshotter.html">external-snapshotter sidecar container</a>
which has been updated to support volume group snapshot.</p>
<p>The external-snapshotter watches the Kubernetes API server for
VolumeGroupSnapshotContent objects, and triggers <code>CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot</code> and
<code>DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot</code> operations against a CSI endpoint.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-limitations">What are the limitations?</h2>
<p>The beta implementation of volume group snapshots for Kubernetes has the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not support reverting an existing PVC to an earlier state represented by
a snapshot (only supports provisioning a new volume from a snapshot).</li>
<li>No application consistency guarantees beyond any guarantees provided by the storage system
(e.g. crash consistency). See this <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/30d06f49fba22273f31b3c616b74cf8745c19b3d/wg-data-protection/data-protection-workflows-white-paper.md#quiesce-and-unquiesce-hooks">doc</a>
for more discussions on application consistency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes project plans to push the volume
group snapshot implementation to general availability (GA) in a future release.</p>

Domino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua "Alex" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.

// Abstract
Given the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.

// Bio
Guanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training. He holds a CS PhD from UC Berkeley advised by Prof Ion Stoica.

Domino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua "Alex" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.

// Abstract
Given the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.

However, the network’s performance advantages demand substantial hardware and networking resources, creating significant <strong>decentralization barriers</strong>. In the following, we try to understand key bottlenecks and reviewing solutions explored by projects like <a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/"><strong>Firedancer</strong></a> (C++), <a href="https://overclock.one/rnd/unveiling-mithril"><strong>Mithril</strong></a> (Go), <a href="https://blog.syndica.io/introducing-sig-by-syndica-an-rps-focused-solana-validator-client-written-in-zig/"><strong>Sig</strong></a> (Zig) for simplifying Solana’s core protocol.</p><h3>Barriers to Solana Node Accessibility</h3><p>As of November 2024, Solana validator nodes require high-end infrastructure to manage the network’s demanding workloads. These requirements include:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: Multi-core processors like AMD EPYC with ideally 24 cores and AVX512 support. These CPUs handle Turbine packet routing, Proof of History (PoH) computation, and the execution of transactions in real time which are compute bound.</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: At least 512 GB of RAM is essential to manage the growing AccountsDB, which holds all account states and balances. The memory also supports maintaining multiple forks during optimistic execution.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: Dual enterprise-grade NVMe drives (2 x 1.92 TB or more) provide the speed and capacity needed for ledger growth and the high disk IO required by validator operations.</li><li><strong>Networking</strong>: A robust connection with a minimum upload speed of 1 Gbps and traffic capacity exceeding 100 TB per month to handle Turbine traffic, gossip communication, and repair requests.</li></ul><p>These stringent requirements, while ensuring high performance, concentrate validator operations within professional data centers. This reliance reduces the diversity of node operators, potentially impacting network decentralization and resilience.</p><h4>Operational Complexity</h4><p>The validator’s role extends beyond simple data propagation, encompassing several computationally intensive tasks:</p><ul><li><strong>Transaction Ingress and Filtering</strong>: Validators receive transactions over the QUIC protocol, verify ED25519 cryptographic signatures, and pack transactions into <strong>shreds</strong> (small, fixed-size data packets used for efficient network dissemination).</li><li><strong>Real-Time Execution</strong>: Validators optimistically execute unconfirmed blocks in parallel while maintaining multiple forks in memory. This enables low-latency transaction processing but demands substantial computational resources.</li><li><strong>Consensus Participation</strong>: Validators implement the TowerBFT protocol to finalize the canonical chain by pruning unneeded forks and aligning with the majority stake.</li></ul><p>This complexity requires specialized knowledge and resources, which limit participation to organizations with significant technical and financial capabilities.</p><h3>Refining Execution Models for Efficiency</h3><p>Solana’s optimistic execution model emphasizes speed but comes with high resource demands. Rethinking execution priorities can reduce these demands while preserving network functionality:</p><h4>Focusing on Confirmed Blocks</h4><p>Nodes focused on verification can prioritize blocks that have achieved a supermajority consensus of 67% validator stake. Ignoring unconfirmed forks reduces memory usage and CPU overhead while maintaining alignment with the canonical chain. This approach aligns with blockchain fundamentals, focusing on deterministic state rather than speculative execution.</p><h4>Batch-Based Execution</h4><p>Batch processing transactions reduces the computational burden of handling each transaction individually. Larger batch windows amortize costs over more transactions, enabling lagging nodes to catch up more efficiently. Techniques like staged synchronization, as implemented in Ethereum’s Erigon client, offer valuable insights for optimizing this process. By aggregating multiple blocks or transactions into larger processing units, nodes can reduce their dependency on high-speed, low-latency operations.</p><h4>Streamlining Bank Management</h4><p>The <strong>Solana bank</strong> is a system that tracks account states and balances across multiple forks. It is integral to the ledger’s functionality, maintaining a live view of the network’s economic state. Pruning redundant forks and offloading older data to disk minimizes memory usage. Efficient selective retrieval ensures that only the necessary data is kept active, reducing the operational footprint. Introducing hierarchical caching mechanisms further enhances this optimization by reducing IO latency for frequently accessed data.</p><h3>Optimizing Networking and Block Propagation</h3><h4>Snapshot-Based Initialization</h4><p>To bootstrap quickly, nodes can download a verified snapshot of the blockchain state, which is a compressed representation of all account balances and programs at a specific point in time. This eliminates the need to process the entire blockchain history during initialization, significantly reducing bandwidth and time requirements. Snapshots also reduce trust assumptions since they can be cryptographically verified against multiple sources, ensuring data integrity.</p><h4>Efficient Turbine Handling</h4><p>Turbine, Solana’s protocol for disseminating shreds, ensures rapid propagation but is bandwidth-intensive. Verification-focused nodes can bypass Turbine by fetching complete blocks directly from trusted peers or <strong>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</strong> services. RPC services are interfaces that allow developers and decentralized applications (dApps) to query blockchain data or submit transactions programmatically. For example, a wallet application might use an RPC endpoint to display user account balances or simulate transaction outcomes. By streamlining RPC interactions and incorporating compression techniques, nodes can minimize data transfer overhead.</p><h4>Repair Requests and Consolidated Bundling</h4><p>Nodes can issue repair requests to fetch missing shreds from the network. Consolidating multiple blocks into single packets during these requests reduces the number of network round trips, optimizing bandwidth usage and synchronization speed. This bundling approach is particularly useful during initial synchronization or periods of high network congestion.</p><h4>Proof of History Optimizations</h4><p><strong>Proof of History (PoH)</strong> is a mechanism that creates a verifiable timeline of events by chaining cryptographic hashes. Each hash depends on the previous one, ensuring that events are ordered and timestamps are reliable. PoH enables fast synchronization and leader scheduling, but its computational demands can be optimized for non-validator nodes:</p><h4>Bypassing PoH Generation</h4><p>Nodes that do not produce blocks can disable the generation of new PoH sequences, which involves grinding SHA-256 hashes continuously. Disabling this frees up CPU cores for other tasks without compromising the node’s ability to validate the chain. By relegating PoH verification to a parallelized task, non-validator nodes can further reduce latency.</p><h4>Leveraging Kernel-Bypass Networking</h4><p>Inspired by Jump Crypto’s Firedancer project, nodes can employ kernel-bypass techniques for networking. By bypassing the operating system’s kernel, network packets are processed directly by the application, reducing latency. Additionally, <strong>Firedancer’s AVX-512-optimized signature verification</strong> accelerates cryptographic operations like ED25519 signature checks. AVX-512 is a vectorized instruction set that processes multiple cryptographic signatures simultaneously, dramatically increasing transaction processing rates and reducing CPU bottlenecks. These enhancements ensure that even resource-constrained nodes can sustain high throughput.</p><h3>Enhancing Ledger and RPC Infrastructure</h3><h4>Ledger Compression Techniques</h4><p>The Solana ledger grows rapidly, necessitating efficient storage solutions. Delta encoding, which records only the changes in account states between blocks, reduces storage requirements significantly. Compaction strategies, such as merging older states, further optimize storage without compromising query performance. These optimizations are critical for maintaining the ledger’s accessibility on consumer-grade hardware.</p><h4>Simplified RPC Design</h4><p>RPC nodes often face high memory demands due to the need for real-time data indexing. Simplifying the RPC infrastructure can alleviate these pressures:</p><ul><li><strong>Basic Query Support</strong>: Implementing efficient account balance and transaction history lookups reduces overhead.</li><li><strong>Optimized Indices</strong>: Using disk-based lookup tables instead of memory-intensive indices balances performance and resource usage.</li><li><strong>Transaction Submission</strong>: Lightweight mechanisms for forwarding transactions ensure scalability without redundancy.</li></ul><h4>Remote Verification Tools</h4><p>Lightweight clients enable users to verify blockchain data securely without running full nodes. Incorporating trust-minimized mechanisms, such as fraud-proof or zero-knowledge systems, ensures that users can validate data independently with minimal resource requirements. These light clients build upon foundational ideas from Bitcoin’s Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, which utilized bloom filters for efficient transaction monitoring. Although Solana’s model diverges in implementation, the underlying goal of reducing resource needs for trustless verification remains consistent.</p><h3>Reducing Bandwidth Costs for Decentralization</h3><h4>Alternative Block Fetching Methods</h4><p>Gossip-based block propagation is bandwidth-intensive. Nodes can reduce costs by fetching blocks directly from RPC endpoints or trusted sources, avoiding redundant transmissions. Optional compression or erasure coding for data packets further optimizes block transfers. Adopting batch-based repair systems enhances the efficiency of large-scale synchronization efforts.</p><h4>Insights from Firedancer</h4><p>Jump Crypto’s Firedancer initiative demonstrates the potential of optimizing Solana’s software stack to push hardware to its limits. Key advancements include:</p><ul><li><strong>Kernel-Bypass Networking</strong>: Firedancer’s implementation of high-performance QUIC and Turbine networking eliminates bottlenecks caused by traditional OS-level networking.</li><li><strong>Optimized Block Packing</strong>: Efficient logic for shred assembly reduces processing latency, ensuring faster transaction finalization.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Diversifying the validator codebase with an independent implementation minimizes systemic risks and improves the network’s robustness.</li></ul><p>Firedancer’s modular approach, exemplified by its Frankendancer deployment, offers a roadmap for incrementally integrating high-performance components into the Solana ecosystem.</p><h3>Towards Broader Participation</h3><p>Solana’s architectural evolution must focus on reducing operational barriers for all participants. By optimizing execution models, networking protocols, and storage systems, the network can achieve broader decentralization without compromising its high-performance standards. Innovations like Firedancer and targeted efficiency improvements provide a clear path to a more accessible and resilient Solana network.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=36f1df3e7efb" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MLOps at JFrog with Bill Manning</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/12/17/mlops-at-jfrog-with-bill-manning/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=mlops-at-jfrog-with-bill-manning</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing.
A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by <strong>list</strong> requests.</p>
<p>In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes <strong>list</strong> requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client.
But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple <strong>list</strong> requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage.
While <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API Priority and Fairness</a> has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection.
This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded.
This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let's consider the below graph.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/17/kube-apiserver-api-streaming/kube-apiserver-memory_usage.png"
alt="Monitoring graph showing kube-apiserver memory usage"/>
</figure>
<p>The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test.
(see the <a href="#the-synthetic-test">synthetic test</a> section for more details).
The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server's memory consumption.
Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-kube-apiserver-allocate-so-much-memory-for-list-requests">Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests?</h2>
<p>Our investigation revealed that this substantial memory allocation occurs because the server before sending the first byte to the client must:</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch data from the database,</li>
<li>deserialize the data from its stored format,</li>
<li>and finally construct the final response by converting and serializing the data into a client requested format</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence results in significant temporary memory consumption.
The actual usage depends on many factors like the page size, applied filters (e.g. label selectors), query parameters, and sizes of individual objects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API Priority and Fairness</a> nor Golang's garbage collection or Golang memory limits can prevent the system from exhausting memory under these conditions.
The memory is allocated suddenly and rapidly, and just a few requests can quickly deplete the available memory, leading to resource exhaustion.</p>
<p>Depending on how the API server is run on the node, it might either be killed through OOM by the kernel when exceeding the configured memory limits during these uncontrolled spikes, or if limits are not configured it might have even worse impact on the control plane node.
And worst, after the first API server failure, the same requests will likely hit another control plane node in an HA setup with probably the same impact.
Potentially a situation that is hard to diagnose and hard to recover from.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-list-requests">Streaming list requests</h2>
<p>Today, we're excited to announce a major improvement.
With the graduation of the <em>watch list</em> feature to beta in Kubernetes 1.32, client-go users can opt-in (after explicitly enabling <code>WatchListClient</code> feature gate)
to streaming lists by switching from <strong>list</strong> to (a special kind of) <strong>watch</strong> requests.</p>
<p><strong>Watch</strong> requests are served from the <em>watch cache</em>, an in-memory cache designed to improve scalability of read operations.
By streaming each item individually instead of returning the entire collection, the new method maintains constant memory overhead.
The API server is bound by the maximum allowed size of an object in etcd plus a few additional allocations.
This approach drastically reduces the temporary memory usage compared to traditional <strong>list</strong> requests, ensuring a more efficient and stable system,
especially in clusters with a large number of objects of a given type or large average object sizes where despite paging memory consumption used to be high.</p>
<p>Building on the insight gained from the synthetic test (see the <a href="#the-synthetic-test">synthetic test</a>, we developed an automated performance test to systematically evaluate the impact of the <em>watch list</em> feature.
This test replicates the same scenario, generating a large number of Secrets with a large payload, and scaling the number of informers to simulate heavy <strong>list</strong> request patterns.
The automated test is executed periodically to monitor memory usage of the server with the feature enabled and disabled.</p>
<p>The results showed significant improvements with the <em>watch list</em> feature enabled.
With the feature turned on, the kube-apiserver’s memory consumption stabilized at approximately <strong>2 GB</strong>.
By contrast, with the feature disabled, memory usage increased to approximately <strong>20GB</strong>, a <strong>10x</strong> increase!
These results confirm the effectiveness of the new streaming API, which reduces the temporary memory footprint.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-api-streaming-for-your-component">Enabling API Streaming for your component</h2>
<p>Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.32. Make sure your cluster uses etcd in version 3.4.31+ or 3.5.13+.
Change your client software to use watch lists. If your client code is written in Golang, you'll want to enable <code>WatchListClient</code> for client-go.
For details on enabling that feature, read <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/12/feature-gates-in-client-go">Introducing Feature Gates to Client-Go: Enhancing Flexibility and Control</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>In Kubernetes 1.32, the feature is enabled in kube-controller-manager by default despite its beta state.
This will eventually be expanded to other core components like kube-scheduler or kubelet; once the feature becomes generally available, if not earlier.
Other 3rd-party components are encouraged to opt-in to the feature during the beta phase, especially when they are at risk of accessing a large number of resources or kinds with potentially large object sizes.</p>
<p>For the time being, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API Priority and Fairness</a> assigns a reasonable small cost to <strong>list</strong> requests.
This is necessary to allow enough parallelism for the average case where <strong>list</strong> requests are cheap enough.
But it does not match the spiky exceptional situation of many and large objects.
Once the majority of the Kubernetes ecosystem has switched to <em>watch list</em>, the <strong>list</strong> cost estimation can be changed to larger values without risking degraded performance in the average case,
and with that increasing the protection against this kind of requests that can still hit the API server in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-synthetic-test">The synthetic test</h2>
<p>In order to reproduce the issue, we conducted a manual test to understand the impact of <strong>list</strong> requests on kube-apiserver memory usage.
In the test, we created 400 Secrets, each containing 1 MB of data, and used informers to retrieve all Secrets.</p>
<p>The results were alarming, only 16 informers were needed to cause the test server to run out of memory and crash, demonstrating how quickly memory consumption can grow under such conditions.</p>

<p>In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a
<code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> option for the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/#static-policy-options">CPU Manager static policy</a>.
This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the
policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-feature">Understanding the feature</h2>
<p>The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#explicitly-reserved-cpu-list">Explicitly Reserved CPU List</a> page.</p>
<p>If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> option.</p>
<p>However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed
pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only
compares the CPU <em>requests</em> against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than
the requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up
the capacity of <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code>, which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we
know that people saw this in real life deployments.
The existing behavior also made benchmarking (for both infrastructure and workloads) results inaccurate.</p>
<p>When this new <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option is enabled, the CPU Manager static policy will not allow any workload to use the reserved system CPU cores.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-the-feature">Enabling the feature</h2>
<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on both the <code>CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions</code> feature gate and the <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option. And you need to remove the <code>/var/lib/kubelet/cpu_manager_state</code> file if it exists and restart kubelet.</p>
<p>With the following kubelet configuration:</p>

<p>You can monitor the feature impact by checking the following CPU Manager counters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cpu_manager_shared_pool_size_millicores</code>: report shared pool size, in millicores (e.g. 13500m)</li>
<li><code>cpu_manager_exclusive_cpu_allocation_count</code>: report exclusively allocated cores, counting full cores (e.g. 16)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your best-effort workloads may starve if the <code>cpu_manager_shared_pool_size_millicores</code> count is zero for prolonged time.</p>
<p>We believe any pod that is required for operational purpose like a log forwarder should not run as best-effort, but you can review and adjust the amount of CPU cores reserved as needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Strict CPU reservation is critical for Telco/NFV use cases. It is also a prerequisite for enabling the all-in-one type of deployments where workloads are placed on nodes serving combined control+worker+storage roles.</p>
<p>We want you to start using the feature and looking forward to your feedback.</p>

    <h1>Go Protobuf: The new Opaque API</h1>
      
      <p class="author">
      Michael Stapelberg<br>
      16 December 2024
      </p>
      
      <p>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)</a>
is Google&rsquo;s language-neutral data interchange format. See
<a href="https://protobuf.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">protobuf.dev</a>.]</p>
<p>Back in March 2020, we released the <code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> module, <a href="/blog/protobuf-apiv2">a
major overhaul of the Go Protobuf API</a>. This
package introduced first-class <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">support for
reflection</a>,
a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/dynamicpb" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>dynamicpb</code></a>
implementation and the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>protocmp</code></a>
package for easier testing.</p>
<p>That release introduced a new protobuf module with a new API. Today, we are
releasing an additional API for generated code, meaning the Go code in the
<code>.pb.go</code> files created by the protocol compiler (<code>protoc</code>). This blog post
explains our motivation for creating a new API and shows you how to use it in
your projects.</p>
<p>To be clear: We are not removing anything. We will continue to support the
existing API for generated code, just like we still support the older protobuf
module (by wrapping the <code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> implementation). Go is
<a href="/blog/compat">committed to backwards compatibility</a> and this
applies to Go Protobuf, too!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background: the (existing) Open Struct API</h2>
<p>We now call the existing API the Open Struct API, because generated struct types
are open to direct access. In the next section, we will see how it differs from
the new Opaque API.</p>
<p>To work with protocol buffers, you first create a <code>.proto</code> definition file like
this one:</p>
<pre><code>edition = &quot;2023&quot;;  // successor to proto2 and proto3

package log;

message LogEntry {
  string backend_server = 1;
  uint32 request_size = 2;
  string ip_address = 3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you <a href="https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/gotutorial/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">run the protocol compiler
(<code>protoc</code>)</a> to generate code
like the following (in a <code>.pb.go</code> file):</p>
<pre><code>package logpb

type LogEntry struct {
  BackendServer *string
  RequestSize   *uint32
  IPAddress     *string
  // …internal fields elided…
}

func (l *LogEntry) GetBackendServer() string { … }
func (l *LogEntry) GetRequestSize() uint32   { … }
func (l *LogEntry) GetIPAddress() string     { … }
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can import the generated <code>logpb</code> package from your Go code and call
functions like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Marshal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.Marshal</code></a>
to encode <code>logpb.LogEntry</code> messages into protobuf wire format.</p>
<p>You can find more details in the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/go-generated/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Generated Code API
documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="presence">(Existing) Open Struct API: Field Presence</h3>
<p>An important aspect of this generated code is how <em>field presence</em> (whether a
field is set or not) is modeled. For instance, the above example models presence
using pointers, so you could set the <code>BackendServer</code> field to:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>proto.String(&quot;zrh01.prod&quot;)</code>: the field is set and contains &ldquo;zrh01.prod&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>proto.String(&quot;&quot;)</code>: the field is set (non-<code>nil</code> pointer) but contains an
empty value</li>
<li><code>nil</code> pointer: the field is not set</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are used to generated code not having pointers, you are probably using
<code>.proto</code> files that start with <code>syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;</code>. The field presence behavior
changed over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>syntax = &quot;proto2&quot;</code> uses <em>explicit presence</em> by default</li>
<li><code>syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;</code> used <em>implicit presence</em> by default (where cases 2 and 3
cannot be distinguished and are both represented by an empty string), but was
later extended to allow <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#field-labels" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">opting into explicit presence with the <code>optional</code>
keyword</a></li>
<li><code>edition = &quot;2023&quot;</code>, the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/editions/overview/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">successor to both proto2 and
proto3</a>, uses <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/field_presence/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>explicit
presence</em></a> by default</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="opaqueapi">The new Opaque API</h2>
<p>We created the new <em>Opaque API</em> to uncouple the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/go-generated/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Generated Code
API</a> from the underlying
in-memory representation. The (existing) Open Struct API has no such separation:
it allows programs direct access to the protobuf message memory. For example,
one could use the <code>flag</code> package to parse command-line flag values into protobuf
message fields:</p>
<pre><code>var req logpb.LogEntry
flag.StringVar(&amp;req.BackendServer, &quot;backend&quot;, os.Getenv(&quot;HOST&quot;), &quot;…&quot;)
flag.Parse() // fills the BackendServer field from -backend flag
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with such a tight coupling is that we can never change how we lay
out protobuf messages in memory. Lifting this restriction enables many
implementation improvements, which we&rsquo;ll see below.</p>
<p>What changes with the new Opaque API? Here is how the generated code from the
above example would change:</p>
<pre><code>package logpb

type LogEntry struct {
  xxx_hidden_BackendServer *string // no longer exported
  xxx_hidden_RequestSize   uint32  // no longer exported
  xxx_hidden_IPAddress     *string // no longer exported
  // …internal fields elided…
}

func (l *LogEntry) GetBackendServer() string { … }
func (l *LogEntry) HasBackendServer() bool   { … }
func (l *LogEntry) SetBackendServer(string)  { … }
func (l *LogEntry) ClearBackendServer()      { … }
// …
</code></pre>
<p>With the Opaque API, the struct fields are hidden and can no longer be
directly accessed. Instead, the new accessor methods allow for getting, setting,
or clearing a field.</p>
<h3 id="lessmemory">Opaque structs use less memory</h3>
<p>One change we made to the memory layout is to model field presence for
elementary fields more efficiently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The (existing) Open Struct API uses pointers, which adds a 64-bit word to the
space cost of the field.</li>
<li>The Opaque API uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">bit
fields</a>, which require one bit per
field (ignoring padding overhead).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using fewer variables and pointers also lowers load on the allocator and on the
garbage collector.</p>
<p>The performance improvement depends heavily on the shapes of your protocol
messages: The change only affects elementary fields like integers, bools, enums,
and floats, but not strings, repeated fields, or submessages (because it is
<a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/opaque-faq/#memorylayout" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">less
profitable</a>
for those types).</p>
<p>Our benchmark results show that messages with few elementary fields exhibit
performance that is as good as before, whereas messages with more elementary
fields are decoded with significantly fewer allocations:</p>
<pre><code>             │ Open Struct API │             Opaque API             │
             │    allocs/op    │  allocs/op   vs base               │
Prod#1          360.3k ± 0%       360.3k ± 0%  +0.00% (p=0.002 n=6)
Search#1       1413.7k ± 0%       762.3k ± 0%  -46.08% (p=0.002 n=6)
Search#2        314.8k ± 0%       132.4k ± 0%  -57.95% (p=0.002 n=6)
</code></pre>
<p>Reducing allocations also makes decoding protobuf messages more efficient:</p>
<pre><code>             │ Open Struct API │             Opaque API            │
             │   user-sec/op   │ user-sec/op  vs base              │
Prod#1         55.55m ± 6%        55.28m ± 4%  ~ (p=0.180 n=6)
Search#1       324.3m ± 22%       292.0m ± 6%  -9.97% (p=0.015 n=6)
Search#2       67.53m ± 10%       45.04m ± 8%  -33.29% (p=0.002 n=6)
</code></pre>
<p>(All measurements done on an AMD Castle Peak Zen 2. Results on ARM and Intel
CPUs are similar.)</p>
<p>Note: proto3 with implicit presence similarly does not use pointers, so you will
not see a performance improvement if you are coming from proto3. If you were
using implicit presence for performance reasons, forgoing the convenience of
being able to distinguish empty fields from unset ones, then the Opaque API now
makes it possible to use explicit presence without a performance penalty.</p>
<h3 id="lazydecoding">Motivation: Lazy Decoding</h3>
<p>Lazy decoding is a performance optimization where the contents of a submessage
are decoded when first accessed instead of during
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Unmarshal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.Unmarshal</code></a>. Lazy
decoding can improve performance by avoiding unnecessarily decoding fields which
are never accessed.</p>
<p>Lazy decoding can&rsquo;t be supported safely by the (existing) Open Struct API. While
the Open Struct API provides getters, leaving the (un-decoded) struct fields
exposed would be extremely error-prone. To ensure that the decoding logic runs
immediately before the field is first accessed, we must make the field private
and mediate all accesses to it through getter and setter functions.</p>
<p>This approach made it possible to implement lazy decoding with the Opaque
API. Of course, not every workload will benefit from this optimization, but for
those that do benefit, the results can be spectacular: We have seen logs
analysis pipelines that discard messages based on a top-level message condition
(e.g. whether <code>backend_server</code> is one of the machines running a new Linux kernel
version) and can skip decoding deeply nested subtrees of messages.</p>
<p>As an example, here are the results of the micro-benchmark we included,
demonstrating how lazy decoding saves over 50% of the work and over 87% of
allocations!</p>
<pre><code>                  │   nolazy    │                lazy                │
                  │   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base               │
Unmarshal/lazy-24   6.742µ ± 0%   2.816µ ± 0%  -58.23% (p=0.002 n=6)

                  │    nolazy    │                lazy                 │
                  │     B/op     │     B/op      vs base               │
Unmarshal/lazy-24   3.666Ki ± 0%   1.814Ki ± 0%  -50.51% (p=0.002 n=6)

                  │   nolazy    │               lazy                │
                  │  allocs/op  │ allocs/op   vs base               │
Unmarshal/lazy-24   64.000 ± 0%   8.000 ± 0%  -87.50% (p=0.002 n=6)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="pointercomparison">Motivation: reduce pointer comparison mistakes</h3>
<p>Modeling field presence with pointers invites pointer-related bugs.</p>
<p>Consider an enum, declared within the <code>LogEntry</code> message:</p>
<pre><code>message LogEntry {
  enum DeviceType {
    DESKTOP = 0;
    MOBILE = 1;
    VR = 2;
  };
  DeviceType device_type = 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A simple mistake is to compare the <code>device_type</code> enum field like so:</p>
<pre><code>if cv.DeviceType == logpb.LogEntry_DESKTOP.Enum() { // incorrect!
</code></pre>
<p>Did you spot the bug? The condition compares the memory address instead of the
value. Because the <code>Enum()</code> accessor allocates a new variable on each call, the
condition can never be true. The check should have read:</p>
<pre><code>if cv.GetDeviceType() == logpb.LogEntry_DESKTOP {
</code></pre>
<p>The new Opaque API prevents this mistake: Because fields are hidden, all access
must go through the getter.</p>
<h3 id="accidentalsharing">Motivation: reduce accidental sharing mistakes</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a slightly more involved pointer-related bug. Assume you are
trying to stabilize an RPC service that fails under high load. The following
part of the request middleware looks correct, but still the entire service goes
down whenever just one customer sends a high volume of requests:</p>
<pre><code>logEntry.IPAddress = req.IPAddress
logEntry.BackendServer = proto.String(hostname)
// The redactIP() function redacts IPAddress to 127.0.0.1,
// unexpectedly not just in logEntry *but also* in req!
go auditlog(redactIP(logEntry))
if quotaExceeded(req) {
    // BUG: All requests end up here, regardless of their source.
    return fmt.Errorf(&quot;server overloaded&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Did you spot the bug? The first line accidentally copied the pointer (thereby
sharing the pointed-to variable between the <code>logEntry</code> and <code>req</code> messages)
instead of its value. It should have read:</p>
<pre><code>logEntry.IPAddress = proto.String(req.GetIPAddress())
</code></pre>
<p>The new Opaque API prevents this problem as the setter takes a value
(<code>string</code>) instead of a pointer:</p>
<pre><code>logEntry.SetIPAddress(req.GetIPAddress())
</code></pre>
<h3 id="reflection">Motivation: Fix Sharp Edges: reflection</h3>
<p>To write code that works not only with a specific message type
(e.g. <code>logpb.LogEntry</code>), but with any message type, one needs some kind of
reflection. The previous example used a function to redact IP addresses. To work
with any type of message, it could have been defined as <code>func redactIP(proto.Message) proto.Message { … }</code>.</p>
<p>Many years ago, your only option to implement a function like <code>redactIP</code> was to
reach for <a href="/blog/laws-of-reflection">Go&rsquo;s <code>reflect</code> package</a>,
which resulted in very tight coupling: you had only the generator output and had
to reverse-engineer what the input protobuf message definition might have looked
like. The <a href="/blog/protobuf-apiv2"><code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> module
release</a> (from March 2020) introduced
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Protobuf
reflection</a>,
which should always be preferred: Go&rsquo;s <code>reflect</code> package traverses the data
structure&rsquo;s representation, which should be an implementation detail. Protobuf
reflection traverses the logical tree of protocol messages without regard to its
representation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, merely <em>providing</em> protobuf reflection is not sufficient and
still leaves some sharp edges exposed: In some cases, users might accidentally
use Go reflection instead of protobuf reflection.</p>
<p>For example, encoding a protobuf message with the <code>encoding/json</code> package (which
uses Go reflection) was technically possible, but the result is not <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">canonical
Protobuf JSON
encoding</a>. Use the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>protojson</code></a>
package instead.</p>
<p>The new Opaque API prevents this problem because the message struct fields are
hidden: accidental usage of Go reflection will see an empty message. This is
clear enough to steer developers towards protobuf reflection.</p>
<h3 id="idealmemory">Motivation: Making the ideal memory layout possible</h3>
<p>The benchmark results from the <a href="#lessmemory">More Efficient Memory
Representation</a> section have already shown that protobuf
performance heavily depends on the specific usage: How are the messages defined?
Which fields are set?</p>
<p>To keep Go Protobuf as fast as possible for <em>everyone</em>, we cannot implement
optimizations that help only one program, but hurt the performance of other
programs.</p>
<p>The Go compiler used to be in a similar situation, up until <a href="/blog/go1.20">Go 1.20 introduced
Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)</a>. By recording the
production behavior (through <a href="/blog/pprof">profiling</a>) and feeding
that profile back to the compiler, we allow the compiler to make better
trade-offs <em>for a specific program or workload</em>.</p>
<p>We think using profiles to optimize for specific workloads is a promising
approach for further Go Protobuf optimizations. The Opaque API makes those
possible: Program code uses accessors and does not need to be updated when the
memory representation changes, so we could, for example, move rarely set fields
into an overflow struct.</p>
<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>
<p>You can migrate on your own schedule, or even not at all—the (existing) Open
Struct API will not be removed. But, if you’re not on the new Opaque API, you
won’t benefit from its improved performance, or future optimizations that target
it.</p>
<p>We recommend you select the Opaque API for new development. Protobuf Edition
2024 (see <a href="https://protobuf.dev/editions/overview/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Protobuf Editions Overview</a>
if you are not yet familiar) will make the Opaque API the default.</p>
<h3 id="hybridapi">The Hybrid API</h3>
<p>Aside from the Open Struct API and Opaque API, there is also the Hybrid API,
which keeps existing code working by keeping struct fields exported, but also
enabling migration to the Opaque API by adding the new accessor methods.</p>
<p>With the Hybrid API, the protobuf compiler will generate code on two API levels:
the <code>.pb.go</code> is on the Hybrid API, whereas the <code>_protoopaque.pb.go</code> version is
on the Opaque API and can be selected by building with the <code>protoopaque</code> build
tag.</p>
<h3 id="rewriting">Rewriting Code to the Opaque API</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/opaque-migration/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">migration
guide</a>
for detailed instructions. The high-level steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the Hybrid API.</li>
<li>Update existing code using the <code>open2opaque</code> migration tool.</li>
<li>Switch to the Opaque API.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="publishing">Advice for published generated code: Use Hybrid API</h3>
<p>Small usages of protobuf can live entirely within the same repository, but
usually, <code>.proto</code> files are shared between different projects that are owned by
different teams. An obvious example is when different companies are involved: To
call Google APIs (with protobuf), use the <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Cloud Client Libraries for
Go</a> from your project. Switching
the Cloud Client Libraries to the Opaque API is not an option, as that would be
a breaking API change, but switching to the Hybrid API is safe.</p>
<p>Our advice for such packages that publish generated code (<code>.pb.go</code> files) is to
switch to the Hybrid API please! Publish both the <code>.pb.go</code> and the
<code>_protoopaque.pb.go</code> files, please. The <code>protoopaque</code> version allows your
consumers to migrate on their own schedule.</p>
<h3 id="enablelazy">Enabling Lazy Decoding</h3>
<p>Lazy decoding is available (but not enabled) once you migrate to the Opaque API!
🎉</p>
<p>To enable: in your <code>.proto</code> file, annotate your message-typed fields with the
<code>[lazy = true]</code> annotation.</p>
<p>To opt out of lazy decoding (despite <code>.proto</code> annotations), the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protolazy" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>protolazy</code>
package
documentation</a>
describes the available opt-outs, which affect either an individual Unmarshal
operation or the entire program.</p>
<h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>By using the open2opaque tool in an automated fashion over the last few years,
we have converted the vast majority of Google’s <code>.proto</code> files and Go code to
the Opaque API. We continuously improved the Opaque API implementation as we
moved more and more production workloads to it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we expect you should not encounter problems when trying the Opaque
API. In case you do encounter any issues after all, please <a href="https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">let us know on the
Go Protobuf issue tracker</a>.</p>

Completing these tasks gives you an instant dopamine hit &#8212; a little celebration in your brain.</p><p>If you&#8217;re on LeetCode, start with easy problems. Every solved problem is like a small win that releases dopamine and keeps you coming back.</p><p>This positive feedback loop helps you form a habit of coding everyday.</p><p>As you get comfortable with the easy stuff, start leveling up.</p><p>Just like in a game, you&#8217;re now ready for the next challenge.</p><p>This way, you&#8217;re challenging yourself just enough to improve without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>It tricks your brain into thinking coding isn&#8217;t so hard and it&#8217;s something you want to keep doing.</p><h1><strong>3. Make it Fun</strong></h1><p>Next, <strong>make coding fun</strong>.</p><p>Most of us start learning to code to land that dream job or ace an interview.</p><p>But what if, just for a moment, you coded without worrying about the end result?</p><p>Think about when you play video games &#8212; you play because it&#8217;s fun, challenging, and maybe a bit competitive.</p><p>Coding can be the same way.</p><p>In the beginning, <strong>code without any pressure or expectation.</strong></p><p>When I first started learning to code, it was with C language, and honestly, I found it dull and boring.</p><p>It felt like something I had to learn to get a good grade, not something I was excited to dive into.</p><p>But things changed when I picked up Python during my summer break. For the first time, I felt like I could actually <em>create</em> something.</p><p>After learning the basics, I started building little things &#8212; first a simple calculator app, then games like Pong and Tetris, and then full-stack applications.</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t thinking about grades, interviews, or jobs &#8212; just the excitement of creating something from scratch.</p><p>Over time, I realized that when I genuinely enjoyed what I was creating, I&#8217;d lose track of time and that&#8217;s when coding started to become more than just a skill. It became a passion.</p><p>So, how can you make coding enjoyable for yourself?</p><p><strong>Start by picking projects that genuinely excite you.</strong></p><p>These projects are easy enough to finish in a short time but engaging enough to keep you interested.</p><p>They&#8217;re just for fun, a chance to experiment and make mistakes without pressure.</p><blockquote><p><em>When coding becomes fun, it shifts from something you have to do to something you want to do.</em></p></blockquote><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe to receive new articles every week.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><h1><strong>4. Checklist</strong></h1><p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about how you can gamify coding to reward yourself everyday.</p><p>The answer is to have a <strong>checklist of tasks</strong> and tick them off as you complete them.</p><p>In video games: each mission or level you complete gives you points, new abilities, or just the thrill of winning.</p><p>This reward triggers a dopamine release that keeps you playing.</p><p>Similarly, think of a checklist as a series of <strong>mini-missions</strong>.</p><p>Every time you cross an item off a checklist, it gives you a dopamine hit that helps you stay motivated motivated and keeps you coming back for more.</p><p><em>Now, creating a checklist for coding isn&#8217;t just about listing random tasks.</em></p><p>It&#8217;s about breaking down your big goals into byte sized tasks.</p><p><strong>Decide what tasks are crucial</strong> to get started and prioritize them.</p><p>Identify <strong>1&#8211;3 tasks</strong> to accomplish each day.</p><p>When learning something new, create a checklist of topics to cover. Go as granular as possible and add sub-topics as part of your checklist.</p><p>Lets say your big goal is to &#8216;Become a full-stack developer.&#8217;</p><p>That&#8217;s exciting, but it&#8217;s also overwhelming.</p><p>Instead, break it down into smaller steps like:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

tools like ChatGPT to generate these checklists with any level of granularity you need.</strong></p><p>When you have a checklist in place, every day feels like a small victory.</p><p>Even if you don&#8217;t finish everything, you have a clear view of your achievements and what&#8217;s left.</p><p>Coding becomes something you want to come back to, just to see that checklist getting

Novelty</strong></h1><p>Alright, let&#8217;s talk about one of the most powerful, yet underrated, aspects of learning: <strong>novelty</strong>.</p><p>Our brains are wired to seek out new experiences.</p><p>Without variety, coding can start to feel repetitive, even boring.</p><p>I remember the first time I switched from Python to learning Java &#8212; it was like learning to ride a bike all over again.</p><p>Everything felt different, from the syntax to the approach to solving problems.</p><p>But that challenge was also what made it exciting.</p><p>One way to keep things interesting is by exploring different types of projects and technologies.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve been working on web development for a while, try something different &#8212;

CPUs execute billions of instructions per second, yet moving data — whether between memory levels or across subsystems — remains orders of magnitude slower. This discrepancy is rooted in physical constraints, such as the speed of light and the time required for electrons to traverse memory buses. Memory bandwidth, latency, and caching hierarchy (L1, L2, L3 caches) are foundational in determining system performance. Understanding and optimizing these factors is central to streamlining data flow and minimizing data motion. The challenge becomes even more significant when working in managed languages like Go, where garbage collection and memory abstraction add further complexity.</p><h3>The Cost of Data Motion vs. Compute</h3><p>The principle that “compute is cheaper than data motion” arises because modern processors are highly optimized for localized operations on data already present in caches. Moving data between caches, main memory, or across interconnects introduces latency that dwarfs computation times. For example, accessing L1 cache can take as little as 1–3 CPU cycles, while accessing main memory may take 100+ cycles. These latencies magnify when data transfers traverse NUMA nodes or I/O subsystems.</p><h4>Memory Bandwidth and Caching</h4><p>Memory bandwidth refers to the rate at which data can be read from or written to memory. It becomes a bottleneck when a program’s working set exceeds the capacity of higher-level caches. Memory-aware optimizations aim to bridge this gap by focusing on how data is accessed and structured.</p><ul><li><strong>Exploiting Cache Hierarchies:</strong> Structure data to maximize temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to reusing the same data frequently, while spatial locality involves accessing contiguous memory regions. For instance, iterating over a matrix row-wise rather than column-wise takes advantage of how modern CPUs prefetch adjacent memory blocks, drastically reducing cache misses.</li><li><strong>Avoiding Cache Pollution:</strong> Access only the data required for computation, reducing unnecessary evictions of useful cache lines. Polluting the cache with extraneous data results in thrashing, where useful data is repeatedly evicted and reloaded. In Go, this might involve careful iteration patterns for slices and maps to ensure efficient cache usage.</li><li><strong>Leverage Blocking Techniques:</strong> Divide computations into chunks that fit within the L1 or L2 cache size, minimizing the need for repeated memory accesses. For example, matrix multiplication algorithms can be restructured to process submatrices that fit entirely into cache.</li><li><strong>Profile and Optimize Memory Behavior:</strong> Tools such as perf, pprof, and cache simulators can identify bandwidth bottlenecks and optimize data placement. Profiling also reveals whether TLB misses—caused by frequent page table lookups—are affecting performance. This insight is vital when processing large datasets in Go, where heap allocations may exacerbate memory fragmentation.</li></ul><h4>Speed-of-Light Constraints</h4><p>Data motion is constrained by physical distances within the hardware. For example, even within a single CPU, moving data between registers, caches, and RAM involves electrical signal propagation limited by the speed of light. At large scales, such as distributed systems or memory-bound HPC tasks, these propagation delays dominate execution times. Optimizing local data usage minimizes these delays and improves system efficiency.</p><h3>Streamlining Data Flow</h3><p>Streamlining data flow requires designing systems to process data efficiently within the constraints of hardware and software. In Go, the choice of data structures, serialization formats, and concurrency primitives directly impacts data flow and execution efficiency.</p><h4>Serialization: JSON vs. Protobuf vs. FlatBuffers</h4><p>Serialization formats are a key consideration in data-intensive applications. JSON is widely used but inefficient due to its verbose structure and reliance on runtime parsing. Protobuf, in contrast, is compact and well-suited for binary serialization but involves additional memory copies during encoding and decoding. FlatBuffers take this further by enabling zero-copy deserialization, which avoids unnecessary data duplication entirely.</p><ul><li><strong>JSON:</strong> Best for human-readable data exchange but expensive in terms of data motion and parsing. Large JSON payloads frequently trigger multiple allocations during deserialization in Go.</li><li><strong>Protobuf:</strong> Compact and fast, with schema enforcement. However, Protobuf involves intermediate memory allocations due to the need for temporary message structures during decoding.</li><li><strong>FlatBuffers:</strong> Ideal for HPC workloads where zero-copy deserialization reduces data motion and garbage collection pressure. FlatBuffers store serialized data in a manner that allows direct access without parsing.</li></ul><p>For systems requiring high throughput, FlatBuffers often outperform Protobuf by avoiding redundant memory copies, especially for large datasets. However, JSON remains useful for debugging and configuration due to its human-readable format.</p><p>Another <strong>pattern to Avoid</strong> is using JSON for serialization in high-throughput systems.</p><pre>jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(data)<br>json.Unmarshal(jsonData, &amp;parsedData)</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> is using FlatBuffers for zero-copy deserialization.</p><pre>// Serialize using FlatBuffers<br>builder := flatbuffers.NewBuilder(1024)<br>... // FlatBuffers schema-based data setup<br>buf := builder.FinishedBytes()<br><br>// Access serialized data without copying<br>flatData := GetRootAsFlatData(buf, 0)<br>value := flatData.SomeField()</pre><p>This eliminates the overhead of intermediate allocations and redundant parsing.</p><h4>In-Place Data Transformations</h4><p>Modifying data in place rather than creating copies avoids unnecessary memory allocations and reduces data motion. In Go, this practice is particularly important because it minimizes interactions with the garbage collector. For instance:</p><p>A common <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> is duplicating data during transformations.</p><pre>func doubleSlice(data []int) []int {<br>    result := make([]int, len(data))<br>    for i := range data {<br>        result[i] = data[i] * 2<br>    }<br>    return result<br>}</pre><p>The <strong>better alternative</strong> modifies the data in place.</p><pre>func doubleSlice(data []int) {<br>    for i := range data {<br>        data[i] *= 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>This approach eliminates redundant allocations and keeps the data within the cache hierarchy, significantly improving performance in iterative computations. Combining this technique with batched operations ensures that data remains cache-resident during intensive computations.</p><h4>Favor Asynchronous Communication</h4><p>Asynchronous communication can eliminate unnecessary blocking and improve throughput in applications where tasks can progress independently. In Go, channels are the primary mechanism for implementing asynchronous workflows. They decouple sender and receiver goroutines, allowing the system to process data in a pipeline or fan-out/fan-in pattern. However, note that managing concurrency well is equally important, poorly implemented, it can amplify contention.</p><p>Note a <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> with channels is coupling goroutines with frequent intercommunication via channels.</p><pre>func worker(input &lt;-chan int, output chan&lt;- int) {<br>    for num := range input {<br>        output &lt;- num * 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>The <strong>better alternative</strong> uses partitioned data processing with independent goroutines.</p><pre>func worker(data []int) {<br>    for i := range data {<br>        data[i] *= 2<br>    }<br>}<br><br>func main() {<br>    data := make([]int, 1000)<br>    chunkSize := 100<br><br>    var wg sync.WaitGroup<br>    for i := 0; i &lt; len(data); i += chunkSize {<br>        wg.Add(1)<br>        go func(slice []int) {<br>            defer wg.Done()<br>            worker(slice)<br>        }(data[i:min(i+chunkSize, len(data))])<br>    }<br>    wg.Wait()<br>}</pre><p>This minimizes synchronization overhead while maintaining concurrency. Asynchronous patterns like this reduce contention and improve scalability by allowing different stages of computation to progress concurrently.</p><h4>Minimize Inter-Goroutine Communication</h4><p>While Go’s lightweight goroutines make concurrency easy, excessive communication between goroutines can lead to bottlenecks. Minimize inter-goroutine communication by designing systems where each goroutine operates independently on localized data.</p><h4>Avoid Locks and Mutexes</h4><p>Locks and mutexes serialize access to shared resources, removing concurrency benefits and increasing contention. Instead, use channels for synchronization or atomic operations for simple counters. When data sharing is unavoidable, minimize critical sections to reduce contention.</p><h3>Scalability as an Architecture Choice</h3><p>Designing for scalability begins at the architectural level. For single-application designs, consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Stateless Services:</strong> Avoid coupling application state to individual processes. Use external stores for state management, enabling horizontal scaling.</li><li><strong>Partitioning Workloads:</strong> Divide tasks into smaller, independent units that can be distributed across multiple worker processes or threads.</li><li><strong>Backpressure Management:</strong> Use bounded channels or rate-limiting techniques to ensure that the system can handle varying workloads without becoming overwhelmed.</li></ul><h3>Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection in Go</h3><p>Go’s garbage collector (GC) is optimized for low-latency applications, but HPC workloads often require precise control over memory to minimize GC interruptions.</p><h4>Escape Analysis</h4><p>Escape analysis determines whether a variable can be allocated on the stack instead of the heap. Stack allocations are much cheaper as they avoid GC involvement. Writing functions that limit pointer escapes helps reduce GC overhead:</p><pre>func createBuffer(size int) []byte {<br>    buf := make([]byte, size)<br>    return buf // Avoid returning a pointer to escape heap allocation<br>}</pre><p>Profiling escape analysis in Go with go build -gcflags=&quot;-m&quot; identifies opportunities for stack allocation. Avoiding heap allocations in performance-critical code paths ensures consistent, low-latency execution.</p><h4>Object Pooling</h4><p>Using sync.Pool for object pooling reduces heap allocations by recycling objects. This approach is particularly effective for short-lived objects like buffers or temporary data structures.</p><p>The <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> is frequent heap allocations leading to GC overhead.</p><pre>func createBuffers(count int, size int) [][]byte {<br>    buffers := make([][]byte, count)<br>    for i := range buffers {<br>        buffers[i] = make([]byte, size)<br>    }<br>    return buffers<br>}</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> preallocates memory and recycle buffers using sync.Pool.</p><pre>var bufferPool = sync.Pool{<br>    New: func() interface{} {<br>        return make([]byte, 1024)<br>    },<br>}<br><br>func process() {<br>    buf := bufferPool.Get().([]byte)<br>    defer bufferPool.Put(buf)<br>    // Process data with buf<br>}</pre><p>Pooling reduces heap pressure and improves memory reuse, i.e. reduces memory fragmentation and ensures that buffers are allocated contiguously, maximizing cache performance. Over-pooling, however, may retain unused objects, inflating memory usage and requiring careful monitoring.</p><h4>Managing Allocation Patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Batch Allocation:</strong> Allocate slices and objects in large batches to amortize allocation overhead. Batch allocation improves cache performance by reducing scattered allocations.</li><li><strong>Avoid Fragmentation:</strong> Use contiguous slices rather than fragmented structures to maintain cache-friendly layouts. Fragmentation leads to increased TLB misses and degraded memory access times.</li><li><strong>Minimize Pointer Chaining:</strong> Excessive pointers degrade cache performance due to scattered memory accesses. Flattening data structures minimizes this overhead.</li></ul><p>An exmaple <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> that is not immediately obvious: Iterating over a 2D slice inefficiently by accessing columns (which leads to non-contiguous memory access).</p><pre>for j := 0; j &lt; len(matrix[0]); j++ {<br>    for i := 0; i &lt; len(matrix); i++ {<br>        matrix[i][j] *= 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> iterates row-by-row to leverage spatial locality.</p><pre>for i := 0; i &lt; len(matrix); i++ {<br>    for j := 0; j &lt; len(matrix[0]); j++ {<br>        matrix[i][j] *= 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>Adjacent elements in memory are accessed sequentially, reducing cache misses.</p><h4>Memory Alignment</h4><p>Memory alignment ensures that data structures are positioned at memory addresses that are multiples of their size. Misaligned data can lead to performance penalties on some architectures. Go’s memory allocator aligns objects to their size by default, but manual alignment may be necessary for specific use cases, such as SIMD operations.</p><p>To aid memory alignment, <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> is using pointer-heavy or fragmented data structures, leading to scattered memory access.</p><pre>type Node struct {<br>    Value int<br>    Next  *Node<br>}</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> is to use contiguous slices for data storage where possible.</p><pre>type Node struct {<br>    Values []int<br>}</pre><p>Flattening structures improves cache performance and minimizes pointer dereferencing.</p><h4>GC Tuning in HPC</h4><p>Garbage collection in Go introduces predictable but non-negligible latency. Tuning GC behavior for HPC workloads involves:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce Allocation Frequency:</strong> Preallocate memory and reuse objects to reduce pressure on the GC.</li><li><strong>Profile GC Activity:</strong> Use pprof to identify regions with high allocation rates and optimize them to minimize GC overhead.</li><li><strong>Adjust GOGC:</strong> The GOGC environment variable controls GC aggressiveness. Lowering it reduces memory usage but increases GC frequency.</li></ul><h3>Managing Performance Counters and Logging</h3><p>Performance counters and logging are essential for understanding application behavior. However, excessive instrumentation can degrade performance, especially in HPC environments.</p><h4>Lock-Free Metrics Collection</h4><p>Using atomic operations for counters ensures thread-safe, low-latency updates without locks:</p><pre>var requestCount uint64<br><br>func incrementRequestCount() {<br>    atomic.AddUint64(&amp;requestCount, 1)<br>}</pre><p>Atomic Compare-and-Swap (CAS) operations can also be used for complex metrics updates, maintaining high performance even under heavy contention.</p><h4>Efficient Logging</h4><p>Logging should balance granularity and overhead. Techniques include:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured Logging:</strong> Use lightweight formats like JSON for logs, ensuring they can be parsed efficiently.</li><li><strong>Batch Logging:</strong> Aggregate log entries in memory and write them in batches to reduce I/O overhead.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Logging:</strong> Offload log writing to separate goroutines to minimize impact on application performance.</li></ul><h4>Push-Based Metrics Collection</h4><p>Aggregating and occasionally pushing metrics balances real-time monitoring with low overhead. For example:</p><pre>func reportMetrics() {<br>    total := atomic.LoadUint64(&amp;requestCount)<br>    fmt.Printf(&quot;Total Requests: %d\n&quot;, total)<br>}</pre><p>Batching metrics ensures that reporting does not interfere with computation, aligning with lock-free principles for minimal contention.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Optimizing data flow and minimizing data motion requires understanding hardware limitations, such as memory bandwidth and cache hierarchies. Go, while a garbage-collected language, is well-suited for HPC when its memory management features are leveraged effectively. Techniques like serialization optimization, object pooling, in-place transformations, asynchronous communication, and lock-free metrics collection help Go applications achieve high throughput and low latency. When paired with careful profiling and tuning, these strategies elevate Go as a practical choice for HPC, balancing developer productivity with computational efficiency.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6ec8340c38e9" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Conquering Configuration Constraints: Real-World Patterns for Distributing Data...

<p>With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA),
marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications.
Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/">CPU Manager</a>.</p>
<p>As part of kubelet's workload admission process,
the memory manager provides topology hints
to optimize memory allocation and alignment.
This enables users to allocate exclusive
memory for Pods in the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#guaranteed">Guaranteed</a> QoS class.
More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/11/kubernetes-1-22-feature-memory-manager-moves-to-beta/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and
observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging.</p>
<h2 id="observability-improvements">Observability improvements</h2>
<p>As part of the effort
to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added
to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>memory_manager_pinning_requests_total</strong> -
tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>memory_manager_pinning_errors_total</strong> -
tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager
to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improving-memory-manager-reliability-and-consistency">Improving memory manager reliability and consistency</h2>
<p>The kubelet does not guarantee pod ordering
when admitting pods after a restart or reboot.</p>
<p>In certain edge cases, this behavior could cause
the memory manager to reject some pods,
and in more extreme cases, it may cause kubelet to fail upon restart.</p>
<p>Previously, the beta implementation lacked certain checks and logic to prevent
these issues.</p>
<p>To stabilize the memory manager for general availability (GA) readiness,
small but critical refinements have been
made to the algorithm, improving its robustness and handling of edge cases.</p>
<h2 id="future-development">Future development</h2>
<p>There is more to come for the future of Topology Manager in general,
and memory manager in particular.
Notably, ongoing efforts are underway
to extend <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128560">memory manager support to Windows</a>,
enabling CPU and memory affinity on a Windows operating system.</p>
<h2 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h2>
<p>This feature is driven by the <a href="https://github.com/Kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-node/README.md">SIG Node</a> community.
Please join us to connect with the community

With over 10 million social media followers, it ranks as one of the most followed beverage brands worldwide, trailing Red Bull and Monster. Despite its rapid rise, Liquid Death has managed to build its identity without ever mentioning typical water features like electrolytes, source location or pH balance—something that luxury water brands like Evian, Smartwater and Fiji emphasize.

WSJ breaks down how the water company’s success underscores a shift in consumer behavior, where branding and culture often speak louder than product substance.

Chapters:
0:00 Liquid Death’s marketing
0:42 Competing with luxury brands
2:25 Distributions and partnerships
4:09 Additional products and expansion

The Economics Of
How do the world's most successful companies generate revenue? In this explainer series, we'll dive into the surprising stories behind how businesses work--exploring everything from Costco's "treasure-hunt" model to the economics behind Amazon's AWS.

is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (&ldquo;whatever program you happen to be running&rdquo;) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here&rsquo;s a quick table of contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</a></li>
<li><a href="#these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</a></li>
<li><a href="#it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: <code>Ctrl-W</code> should delete the last word</a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</a></li>
<li><a href="#rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</a></li>
<li><a href="#these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave &ndash; the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn&rsquo;t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there&rsquo;s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I&rsquo;m using. Instead of &ldquo;uh, programs could do literally
anything&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just writing down what I&rsquo;ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print &ldquo;regular&rdquo; output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m going to focus on things that it&rsquo;s not 100% obvious are
the program&rsquo;s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a &ldquo;law of nature&rdquo;
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it &ndash; even though <code>cat</code> doesn&rsquo;t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in &ldquo;rule 3&rdquo; below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program&rsquo;s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs&rsquo; implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don&rsquo;t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a &ldquo;you should act like the default&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is
that by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very
recently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash
with some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default
ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme
will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux&rsquo;s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a
program is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage. The only reason I&rsquo;ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/">scheduler</a> is the core
component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes
these new Pods <strong>one by one</strong>. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important
the throughput of the scheduler becomes.</p>
<p>Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput
of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the
scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#extension-points">scheduling context element</a>
named <em>QueueingHint</em>. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how
QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-queue">Scheduling queue</h2>
<p>The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the <em>scheduling queue</em>.</p>
<p>The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ActiveQ</strong>: holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling.</li>
<li><strong>BackoffQ</strong>: holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The
backoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod.</li>
<li><strong>Unschedulable Pod Pool</strong>: holds Pods that the scheduler won't attempt to schedule for one of the
following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster
hasn't changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</li>
<li>The Pods are blocked from entering the scheduling cycles by PreEnqueue Plugins,
for example, they have a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/#configuring-pod-schedulinggates">scheduling gate</a>,
and get blocked by the scheduling gate plugin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scheduling-framework-and-plugins">Scheduling framework and plugins</h2>
<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is implemented following the Kubernetes
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/">scheduling framework</a>.</p>
<p>And, all scheduling features are implemented as plugins
(e.g., <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity">Pod affinity</a>
is implemented in the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin.)</p>
<p>The scheduler processes pending Pods in phases called <em>cycles</em> as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheduling cycle</strong>: the scheduler takes pending Pods from the activeQ component of the scheduling
queue <em>one by one</em>. For each Pod, the scheduler runs the filtering/scoring logic from every scheduling plugin. The
scheduler then decides on the best node for the Pod, or decides that the Pod can't be scheduled at that time.</p>
<p>If the scheduler decides that a Pod can't be scheduled, that Pod enters the Unschedulable Pod Pool
component of the scheduling queue. However, if the scheduler decides to place the Pod on a node,
the Pod goes to the binding cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Binding cycle</strong>: the scheduler communicates the node placement decision to the Kubernetes API
server. This operation bounds the Pod to the selected node.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from some exceptions, most unscheduled Pods enter the unschedulable pod pool after each scheduling
cycle. The Unschedulable Pod Pool component is crucial because of how the scheduling cycle processes Pods one by one. If the scheduler had to constantly retry placing unschedulable Pods, instead of offloading those
Pods to the Unschedulable Pod Pool, multiple scheduling cycles would be wasted on those Pods.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-to-retrying-pod-scheduling-with-queuinghint">Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint</h2>
<p>Unschedulable Pods only move back into the ActiveQ or BackoffQ components of the scheduling
queue if changes in the cluster might allow the scheduler to place those Pods on nodes.</p>
<p>Prior to v1.32, each plugin registered which cluster changes could solve their failures, an object creation, update, or deletion in the cluster (called <em>cluster events</em>),
with <code>EnqueueExtensions</code> (<code>EventsToRegister</code>),
and the scheduling queue retries a pod with an event that is registered by a plugin that rejected the pod in a previous scheduling cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, we had an internal feature called <code>preCheck</code>, which helped further filtering of events for efficiency, based on Kubernetes core scheduling constraints;
For example, <code>preCheck</code> could filter out node-related events when the node status is <code>NotReady</code>.</p>
<p>However, we had two issues for those approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requeueing with events was too broad, could lead to scheduling retries for no reason.
<ul>
<li>A new scheduled Pod <em>might</em> solve the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>'s failure, but not all of them do.
For example, if a new Pod is created, but without a label matching <code>InterPodAffinity</code> of the unschedulable pod, the pod wouldn't be schedulable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>preCheck</code> relied on the logic of in-tree plugins and was not extensible to custom plugins,
like in issue <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175">#110175</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here QueueingHints come into play;
a QueueingHint subscribes to a particular kind of cluster event, and make a decision about whether each incoming event could make the Pod schedulable.</p>
<p>For example, consider a Pod named <code>pod-a</code> that has a required Pod affinity. <code>pod-a</code> was rejected in
the scheduling cycle by the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin because no node had an existing Pod that matched
the Pod affinity specification for <code>pod-a</code>.</p>
<figure>

alt="A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin"/> <figcaption>
<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>pod-a</code> moves into the Unschedulable Pod Pool. The scheduling queue records which plugin caused
the scheduling failure for the Pod. For <code>pod-a</code>, the scheduling queue records that the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>
plugin rejected the Pod.</p>
<p><code>pod-a</code> will never be schedulable until the InterPodAffinity failure is resolved.
There're some scenarios that the failure could be resolved, one example is an existing running pod gets a label update and becomes matching a Pod affinity.
For this scenario, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> callback function checks every Pod label update that occurs in the cluster.
Then, if a Pod gets a label update that matches the Pod affinity requirement of <code>pod-a</code>, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>,
plugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> prompts the scheduling queue to move <code>pod-a</code> back into the ActiveQ or
the BackoffQ component.</p>

<h2 id="queueinghint-s-history-and-what-s-new-in-v1-32">QueueingHint's history and what's new in v1.32</h2>
<p>At SIG Scheduling, we have been working on the development of QueueingHint since
Kubernetes v1.28.</p>
<p>While QueuingHint isn't user-facing, we implemented the <code>SchedulerQueueingHints</code> feature gate as a
safety measure when we originally added this feature. In v1.28, we implemented QueueingHints with a
few in-tree plugins experimentally, and made the feature gate enabled by default.</p>
<p>However, users reported a memory leak, and consequently we disabled the feature gate in a
patch release of v1.28. From v1.28 until v1.31, we kept working on the QueueingHint implementation
within the rest of the in-tree plugins and fixing bugs.</p>
<p>In v1.32, we made this feature enabled by default again. We finished implementing QueueingHints
in all plugins and also identified the cause of the memory leak!</p>
<p>We thank all the contributors who participated in the development of this feature and those who reported and investigated the earlier issues.</p>

From a report: Jules was introduced today alongside Gemini 2.0, and uses the updated Google AI model to create multi-step plans to address issues, modify multiple files, and prepare pull requests for Python and Javascript coding tasks in GitHub workflows. 

Microsoft introduced a similar experience for GitHub Copilot last year that can recognize and explain code, alongside recommending changes and fixing bugs. Jules will compete against Microsoft's offering, and also against tools like Cursor and even Claude and ChatGPT's coding abilities. Google's launch of a coding-focused AI assistant is no surprise -- CEO Sundar Pichai said in October that more than a quarter of all new code at the company is now generated by AI. 

"Jules handles bug fixes and other time-consuming tasks while you focus on what you actually want to build," Google says in its blog post. "This effort is part of our long-term goal of building AI agents that are helpful in all domains, including coding."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>AI's Next Frontier // MLOps Podcast #277 with Aditya Naganath, Principal at Kleiner Perkins.

// Abstract
LLMs have ushered in an unmistakable supercycle in the world of technology. The low-hanging use cases have largely been picked off. The next frontier will be AI coworkers who sit alongside knowledge workers, doing work side by side. At the infrastructure level, one of the most important primitives invented by man - the data center, is being fundamentally rethought in this new wave.

// Bio
Aditya Naganath joined Kleiner Perkins’ investment team in 2022 with a focus on artificial intelligence, enterprise software applications, infrastructure and security. Prior to joining Kleiner Perkins, Aditya was a product manager at Google focusing on growth initiatives for the next billion users team. He previously was a technical lead at Palantir Technologies and formerly held software engineering roles at Twitter and Nextdoor, where he was a Kleiner Perkins fellow. Aditya earned a patent during his time at Twitter for a technical analytics product he co-created.

Originally from Mumbai India, Aditya graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and an MBA from Stanford University. Outside of work, you can find him playing guitar with a hard rock band, competing in chess or on the squash courts, and fostering puppies. He is also an avid poker player.

Now, President Bashar al-Assad has fled to Russia, and the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham are in control of Damascus. Why did Assad have Russian and Iranian support? Who were the rebel forces fighting in Syria to overthrow Assad’s regime? 

WSJ breaks down how it happened – and what might come next with a group the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization now in charge.

Seth Larson, security developer-in-residence at the Python Software Foundation, raised the issue in a blog post last week, urging those reporting bugs not to use AI systems for bug hunting. 

"Recently I've noticed an uptick in extremely low-quality, spammy, and LLM-hallucinated security reports to open source projects," he wrote, pointing to similar findings from the Curl project in January. "These reports appear at first glance to be potentially legitimate and thus require time to refute." Larson argued that low-quality reports should be treated as if they're malicious. 

As if to underscore the persistence of these concerns, a Curl project bug report posted on December 8 shows that nearly a year after maintainer Daniel Stenberg raised the issue, he's still confronted by "AI slop" -- and wasting his time arguing with a bug submitter who may be partially or entirely automated.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>The Kubernetes v1.32 Release Theme is &quot;Penelope&quot;.</p>
<p>If Kubernetes is Ancient Greek for &quot;pilot&quot;, in this release we start from that origin
and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments:
each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;,<br>
weaved for 10 years -- each night removing parts of what she had done during the day --
so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much
clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes.
With v1.32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary,
we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew
that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges:
may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-recent-key-features">Updates to recent key features</h2>
<h3 id="a-note-on-dra-enhancements">A note on DRA enhancements</h3>
<p>In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the
Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system. These enhancements aim
to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such
as GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters.
These features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing
applications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support <a href="#structured-parameter-support">got promoted to beta</a>.</p>
<h3 id="quality-of-life-improvements-on-nodes-and-sidecar-containers-update">Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG Node</a> has the following highlights that go beyond
KEPs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting
the maximum number of restarts within a given time period. This enhances the reliability of the kubelet. For more
details, see pull request <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127566">#127566</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases when an image pull back-off error is encountered, the message displayed in the Pod status has been improved
to be more human-friendly and to indicate details about why the Pod is in this condition.
When an image pull back-off occurs, the error is appended to the <code>status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.message</code>
field in the Pod specification with an <code>ImagePullBackOff</code> value in the <code>reason</code> field. This change provides you with
more context and helps you to identify the root cause of the issue. For more details, see pull request
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127918">#127918</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sidecar containers feature is targeting graduation to Stable in v1.33. To view the remaining work items and
feedback from users, see comments in the issue

Storage</a>.</p>
<h3 id="structured-parameter-support">Structured parameter support</h3>
<p>The core part of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), the structured parameter support, got promoted to beta.
This allows the kube-scheduler and Cluster Autoscaler to simulate claim allocation directly, without needing a
third-party driver.
These components can now predict whether resource requests can be fulfilled based on the cluster's current state without actually
committing to the allocation. By eliminating the need for a third-party driver to validate or test allocations, this
feature improves planning and decision-making for resource distribution, making the scheduling and scaling processes
more efficient.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381">KEP #4381</a>, by WG Device
Management (a cross functional team containing <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG Node</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling">SIG Scheduling</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-autoscaling">SIG
Autoscaling</a>).</p>
<h3 id="label-and-field-selector-authorization">Label and field selector authorization</h3>
<p>Label and field selectors can be used in authorization decisions. The node authorizer
automatically takes advantage of this to limit nodes to list or watch their pods only.
Webhook authorizers can be updated to limit requests based on the label or field selector used.</p>
<p>This work was done as part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4601">KEP #4601</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-auth">SIG Auth</a>.</p>
<h2 id="highlights-of-new-features-in-alpha">Highlights of new features in Alpha</h2>
<p><em>This is a selection of key improvements introduced as alpha features in the v1.32 release.</em></p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>
<p>The Kubernetes scheduler has been enhanced with Asynchronous Preemption, a feature that improves scheduling throughput
by handling preemption operations asynchronously. Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by
evicting lower-priority ones, but this process previously involved heavy operations like API calls to delete pods,
slowing down the scheduler. With this enhancement, such tasks are now processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to
continue scheduling other pods without delays.
This improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a
more efficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of KEP <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4832">#4832</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mutating-admission-policies-using-cel-expressions">Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions</h3>
<p>This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply’s merge
algorithms. It simplifies policy definition, reduces mutation conflicts, and enhances admission control performance
while laying a foundation for more robust, extensible policy frameworks in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes API server now supports Common Expression Language (CEL)-based Mutating Admission Policies, providing a
lightweight, efficient alternative to mutating admission webhooks. With this enhancement, administrators can use CEL to
declare mutations like setting labels, defaulting fields, or injecting sidecars with simple, declarative expressions.
This approach reduces operational complexity, eliminates the need for webhooks, and integrates directly with the
kube-apiserver, offering faster and more reliable in-process mutation handling.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3962">KEP #3962</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery">SIG API
Machinery</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pod-level-resource-specifications">Pod-level resource specifications</h3>
<p>This enhancement simplifies resource management in Kubernetes by introducing the ability to set resource requests and
limits at the Pod level, creating a shared pool that all containers in the Pod can dynamically use. This is particularly
valuable for workloads with containers that have fluctuating or bursty resource needs, as it minimizes over-provisioning
and improves overall resource efficiency.</p>
<p>By leveraging Linux cgroup settings at the Pod level, Kubernetes ensures that these resource limits are enforced while
enabling tightly coupled containers to collaborate more effectively without hitting artificial constraints. Importantly,
this feature maintains backward compatibility with existing container-level resource settings, allowing users to adopt
it incrementally without disrupting current workflows or existing configurations.</p>
<p>This marks a significant improvement for multi-container pods, as it reduces the operational complexity of managing
resource allocations across containers. It also provides a performance boost for tightly integrated applications, such
as sidecar architectures, where containers share workloads or depend on each other’s availability to perform optimally.</p>
<p>This work was done as part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837">KEP #2837</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG
Node</a>.</p>
<h3 id="allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook">Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook</h3>
<p>This enhancement introduces the ability to set a zero-second sleep duration for the PreStop lifecycle hook in
Kubernetes, offering a more flexible and no-op option for resource validation and customization. Previously, attempting
to define a zero value for the sleep action resulted in validation errors, restricting its use. With this update, users
can configure a zero-second duration as a valid sleep setting, enabling immediate execution and termination behaviors
where needed.</p>
<p>The enhancement is backward-compatible, introduced as an opt-in feature controlled by the
<code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate. This change is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring PreStop
hooks for validation or admission webhook processing without requiring an actual sleep duration. By aligning with the
capabilities of the <code>time.After</code> Go function, this update simplifies configuration and expands usability for Kubernetes
workloads.</p>
<p>This work was done as part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4818">KEP #4818</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG
Node</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dra-standardized-network-interface-data-for-resource-claim-status">DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status</h3>
<p>This enhancement adds a new field that allows drivers to report specific device status data for each allocated object
in a ResourceClaim. It also establishes a standardized way to represent networking devices information.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4817">KEP #4817</a>, by
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network">SIG Network</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-statusz-and-flagz-endpoints-for-core-components">New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components</h3>
<p>You can enable two new HTTP endpoints, <code>/statusz</code> and <code>/flagz</code>, for core components.
These enhance cluster debuggability by gaining insight into what versions (e.g. Golang version) that component is
running as, along with details about its uptime, and which command line flags that component was executed with;
making it easier to diagnose both runtime and configuration issues.</p>
<p>This work was done as part of

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation">SIG Instrumentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="windows-strikes-back">Windows strikes back!</h3>
<p>Support for graceful shutdowns of Windows nodes in Kubernetes clusters has been added.
Before this release, Kubernetes provided graceful node shutdown functionality for Linux nodes
but lacked equivalent support for Windows. This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system
shutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated,
allowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability
of clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates.</p>
<p>Moreover CPU and memory affinity support has been added for Windows nodes with nodes, with improvements
to the CPU manager, memory manager and topology manager.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="deprecations-and-removals">Deprecations and removals</h3>
<p>As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project's
overall health.
See the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/">deprecation and removal policy</a> for more details on
this process.</p>
<h4 id="withdrawal-of-the-old-dra-implementation">Withdrawal of the old DRA implementation</h4>
<p>The enhancement <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063">#3063</a> introduced Dynamic Resource Allocation
(DRA) in Kubernetes 1.26.</p>
<p>However, in Kubernetes v1.32, this approach to DRA will be significantly changed. Code related to the original
implementation will be removed, leaving KEP <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381">#4381</a> as the &quot;new&quot;
base functionality.</p>
<p>The decision to change the existing approach originated from its incompatibility with cluster autoscaling as resource
availability was non-transparent, complicating decision-making for both Cluster Autoscaler and controllers.
The newly added Structured Parameter model substitutes the functionality.</p>
<p>This removal will allow Kubernetes to handle new hardware requirements and resource claims more predictably, bypassing
the complexities of back and forth API calls to the kube-apiserver.</p>
<p>See the enhancement issue <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063">#3063</a> to find out more.</p>
<h4 id="api-removals">API removals</h4>
<p>There is one API removal in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32">Kubernetes v1.32</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3</code> API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed.
To prepare for this, you can edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the
<code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API</code> version, available since v1.29.
All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3
include that the PriorityLevelConfiguration <code>spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares</code> field only defaults to 30 when
unspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30.</li>

You can use tools like Flake8, PyLint or Ruff to lint your code. You might use Mypy to verify type checking. There are lots of other tools at your disposal. But it can be hard to remember to do that every time you want to create a pull request (PR) in GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p>That is where continuous integration (CI) tools come in. GitHub has something called GitHub Actions that allow you to run tools or entire workflows on certain types of events.</p>
<p>In this article, you will learn how to create a <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Action</a> that runs Ruff on a PR. You can learn more about Ruff in my <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/06/28/an-intro-to-ruff-an-extremely-fast-python-linter/">introductory article</a>.</p>
<h2>Creating a Workflow</h2>
<p>In the root folder of your code, you will need to create a folder called <strong>.github/workflows</strong>. Note the period at the beginning and the fact that you need a subfolder named <strong>workflows</strong> too. Inside of that, you will create a YAML file.</p>
<p>Since you are going to run Ruff to lint and format your Python files, you can call this YAML file <strong>ruff.yml. </strong>Put the following in your new file:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">name: Ruff
on: [workflow_dispatch, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.13"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install ruff
      # Include `--format=github` to enable automatic inline annotations.
      - name: Run Ruff
        run: ruff check --output-format=github .
        continue-on-error: false
      - name: Run Ruff format
        run: ruff format --check .
        continue-on-error: false</pre>
<p>Note: This example comes from my <a href="https://github.com/driscollis/textual-cogs/blob/main/.github/workflows/ruff.yml">textual-cogs repo</a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what this does. This line is pretty important:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">on: [workflow_dispatch, pull_request]</pre>
<p>It tells GitHub to run this workflow when there&#8217;s a pull request and also with &#8220;workflow_dispatch&#8221;. That second option lets you go to the <strong>Actions</strong> tab in your GitHub repo, select the workflow and run it manually. If you do not include that, you cannot run it manually at all. This is useful for testing purposes, but you can remove it if you do not need it.</p>
<p>The next part tells GitHub to run the build on ubuntu-linux:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest</pre>
<p>If you have a GitHub subscription, you can also get Windows as a runner, which means that you can also run these actions on Windows in addition to Linux.</p>
<p>The steps section is the meat of this particular workflow:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Install Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    with:
      python-version: "3.13"
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install ruff
  # Include `--format=github` to enable automatic inline annotations.
  - name: Run Ruff
    run: ruff check --output-format=github .
    continue-on-error: false
  - name: Run Ruff format
    run: ruff format --check .
    continue-on-error: false</pre>
<p>Here is uses a built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">checkout@v4 workflow</a>, which is something that comes with GitHub. There are many others you can use to enhance your workflows and add new functionality. Next, you get setup with Python 3.13 and then you install your dependencies.</p>
<p>Once your dependencies are installed, you can run your tools. In this case, you are installing and running Ruff. For every PR, you run <code>ruff check --output-format=github .</code>, which will do all sorts of linting on your Python code. If any errors are found, it will add inline comments with the error, which is what that <code>--output-format</code> flag is for.</p>
<p>You also have a separate section to run Ruff format, which will format your code to follow the <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a> formatter (for the most part).</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>You can add lots of other tools to your workflows too. For example, you might add a Mypy workflow, or some test workflows to run on PR or perhaps before merging to your main branch. You might even want to check your <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/09/20/learning-about-code-metrics-in-python-with-radon/">code complexity</a> before allowing a merge too!</p>
<p>With a little work, you will soon be able to use GitHub Actions to keep your code cleaner and make it more uniform too. Adding automated testing is even better! Give it a try and let me know what you think.</p>

Renowned Linux kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced Thursday that the Linux 6.12 kernel series has been officially marked as LTS (Long Term Support) on the kernel.org website with a predicted life expectancy of at least two years. 

Linux kernel 6.12 was released on November 17th, 2024, and introduces new features like real-time "PREEMPT_RT" support, a new scheduler called sched_ext, and DRM panic messages as QR codes, as well as numerous new and updated drivers for better hardware support... 

Linux kernel 6.12 joins the many other long-term support kernel branches, namely Linux 6.6 LTS, Linux 6.1 LTS, Linux 5.15 LTS, Linux 5.10 LTS, and Linux 5.4 LTS. Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.

English</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/08/2154224/thanks-to-ai-the-hottest-new-programming-language-is-english?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Dec 2024 21:57:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Generative AI is transforming software development by enabling natural language prompts to generate code, reducing the need for traditional programming skills," argues Analytics India magazine.


Traditionally, coding was the bastion of the select few who had mastered mighty languages like C++, Python, or Java. The idea of programming seemed exclusively reserved for those fluent in syntax and logic. However, the narrative is now being challenged by natural language coding being implemented in AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla predicted this trend last year.... English is emerging as the universal coding language. 

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes that English is becoming a new programming language thanks to AI advancements. Speaking at the World Government Summit, Huang explained, "It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human"... He calls this a "miracle of AI," emphasising how it closes the technology divide and empowers people from all fields to become effective technologists without traditional coding skills... "In the future, you will tell the computer what you want, and it will do it,"&#226; Huang commented. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and its successors have made this possible... 


Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been equally vocal about the potential of English for coding. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, an AI code assistant, enables developers to describe their needs in natural language and receive functional code in response. Nadella describes this as part of a broader mission to "empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more".... In a discussion earlier last year, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque claimed, "41% of codes on GitHub are AI-generated"... 

In 2024, the ability to program is no longer reserved for a few. It's a skill anyone can wield, thanks to the power of natural language processing and AI
 
"No longer is the power to create software restricted to those who can decipher programming languages," the article concludes. "Anyone with a problem to solve and a clear enough articulation of that problem can now write software." 

Although the article also includes this consoling quote from Nvidia's Huang in March. "There is an artistry to prompt engineering. It's how you fine-tune the instructions to get exactly what you want"<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Instead the geek tradition of programming-language advent calendars "seems to have started way back in 2000," according to one history, "when London-based programmer Mark Fowler launched a calendar highlighting a different Perl module each day." 
So the tradition continues...

Nearly a quarter of a century later, there's still a Perl Advent Calendar, celebrating tips and tricks like "a few special packages waiting under the tree that can give your web applications a little extra pep in their step."
And of course there's a separate advent calendar for Raku programmers.
Since 2009 web performance consultant (and former Yahoo and Facebook engineer) Stoyan Stefanov has been pulling together an annual Web Performance calendar with helpful blog posts. 
There's also a JVM Advent calendar with daily helpful hints for Java programmers.
Another advent calendar promises daily posts about C#.
The HTMHell site &mdash; which bills itself as "a collection of bad practices in HTML, copied from real websites" &mdash; is celebrating the season with the "HTMHell Advent Calendar," promising daily articles on security, accessibility, UX, and performance.
There's even an advent calendar with tips for the reverse-engineering framework Radar.
There's still a lovely web-design themed calendar at Designcember.com.


And meanwhile developers at the Svelte frontend framework are actually promising to release something new each day, "whether it's a new feature in Svelte or SvelteKit or an improvement to the website!" 


But not every tech advent calendar is about programming...

Adafruit's managing director is publishing a Retrocomputing Advent Calendar &mdash; daily looks at the ghosts of computers past.

The Atlantic continues its 17-year tradition of a Space Telescope advent calendar, featuring daily images from both NASA's Hubble telescope and James Webb Space Telescope
The gaming blog Rock Paper Shotgun has been counting down their favorite games of 2024...

The gateway processes these requests, enforces security, and forwards them to the appropriate microservices.</p><p>In this article, we will explore why do we need an API gateway, the key features it provides and how it works step by step.</p><div><hr></div><h2>&#128227; <a href="https://dub.link/algo-dec7">Improve your Product Skills - PostHog Newsletter (Sponsored)</a></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png" width="1456" height="291" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:291,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong><a href="https://dub.link/algo-dec7">Product for Engineers</a></strong> is PostHog&#8217;s newsletter dedicated to helping engineers improve their product skills.

<strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong></h4><p>API Gateway secures the backend systems by ensuring only authorized users and clients can access backend services.</p><p>It handles tasks like:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying the identity of the client using tokens (e.g., OAuth, JWT), API keys, or certificates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization:</strong> Checking the client&#8217;s permissions to access specific services or resources.</p></li></ul><p>By centralizing these tasks, the API gateway eliminates the need for individual services to handle authentication, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistent access control across the system.</p><h4>2. <strong>Rate Limiting</strong></h4><p>To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources, most API Gateways implement <strong>rate limiting</strong>.</p><p>This feature:</p><ul><li><p>Controls the frequency of requests a client can make within a given timeframe.</p></li><li><p>Protects backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic or potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>For example, a public API might allow a maximum of 100 requests per minute per user. If a client exceeds this limit, the API Gateway will block additional requests until the rate resets.</p></blockquote><h4>3. <strong>Load Balancing</strong></h4><p>High-traffic applications rely on <strong>load balancing</strong> to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of a service. </p><p>The API Gateway can:</p><ul><li><p>Redirect requests to healthy service instances while avoiding ones that are down or overloaded.</p></li><li><p>Use algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or weighted distribution to manage traffic intelligently.</p></li></ul><h4>4. <strong>Caching</strong></h4><p>To improve response times and reduce the strain on backend services, most API Gateways provide <strong>caching</strong>. </p><p>They temporarily store frequently requested data, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Responses to commonly accessed endpoints (e.g., product catalogs or weather data).</p></li><li><p>Static resources like images or metadata.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Caching helps in reducing latency and enhancing user experience while lowering the operational cost of backend services.</p></blockquote><h4>5. <strong>Request Transformation</strong></h4><p>In systems with diverse clients and backend services, <strong>request transformation</strong> is essential for compatibility.</p><p>An API Gateway can:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the structure or format of incoming requests to match the backend service requirements.</p></li><li><p>Transform responses before sending them back to the client, ensuring they meet the client&#8217;s expectations.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>For instance, it might convert XML responses from a legacy service into JSON for modern frontend applications.</p></blockquote><h4>6. <strong>Service Discovery</strong></h4><p>Modern systems often involve microservices that scale dynamically. </p><p>The <strong>service discovery</strong> feature of an API Gateway dynamically identifies the appropriate backend service instance to handle each request.</p><p>This ensures seamless request routing even in environments where services frequently scale up or down.</p><h4>7. <strong>Circuit Breaking</strong></h4><p>Circuit breaking is a mechanism that temporarily stops sending requests to a backend service when it detects persistent failures, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Slow responses or timeouts.</p></li><li><p>Server errors (e.g., HTTP 500 status codes).</p></li><li><p>High latency or unavailability of a service.</p></li></ul><p>The API Gateway continuously monitors the health and performance of backend services and uses circuit breaking to block requests to a failing service.</p><h4>8. <strong>Logging and Monitoring </strong></h4><p>API Gateways provide robust <strong>monitoring and logging</strong> capabilities to track and analyze system behavior.</p><p>These capabilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Logging detailed information about each request, such as source, destination, and response time.</p></li><li><p>Collecting metrics like request rates, error rates, and latency.</p></li></ul><p>This data helps system administrators detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the system&#8217;s performance. Many API Gateways also integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch.</p><h2><strong>3. How Does an API Gateway Work?</strong></h2><p>Imagine you're using a food delivery app to order dinner. When you tap "Place Order" your phone makes an API request. But instead of talking directly to various backend services, it communicates with an API Gateway first.</p><h4><strong>Step 1: Request Reception</strong></h4><p>When you tap "Place Order," the app sends a request to the <strong>API Gateway</strong>, asking it to process your order. </p><p>This request includes things like:</p><ul><li><p>Your user ID</p></li><li><p>Selected restaurant and menu items</p></li><li><p>Delivery address</p></li><li><p>Payment method</p></li><li><p>Authentication tokens</p></li></ul><p>The API Gateway receives the request as the single entry point to the backend system.</p><h4><strong>Step 2: Request Validation</strong></h4><p>Before forwarding the request, the API Gateway validates it to ensure:</p><ul><li><p>The required parameters or headers are present.</p></li><li><p>The data is in the correct format (e.g., JSON).</p></li><li><p>The request conforms to the expected structure or schema.</p></li></ul><pre><code>// Example of initial request handling
app.post('/api/v1/orders', async (req, res) =&gt; {
    // Check if request has required headers
    if (!req.headers['content-type'].includes('application/json')) {
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid content type');
    }
    // Continue processing...
});</code></pre><p>If any information is missing or incorrect, the gateway immediately rejects the request and notifies the app  with an appropriate error message.</p><h4><strong>Step 3: Authentication &amp; Authorization</strong></h4><p>The gateway now verifies your identity and permissions to ensures only legitimate users can place orders:</p><ul><li><p>It forwards your authentication token (e.g., OAuth or JWT) to an identity provider to confirm your identity.</p></li><li><p>It checks your permissions to ensure you&#8217;re authorized to use the app for placing an order.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const authenticateRequest = async (req) =&gt; {
    // Extract JWT token from header
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    
    // Verify token and get user details
    const user = await verifyToken(token);
    
    // Check if user has permission to place orders
    return user.permissions.includes('place_orders');
};</code></pre><p>If authentication or authorization fails, the API Gateway sends a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> or <code>403 Forbidden</code> error back to the app.</p><h4><strong>Step 4: Rate Limiting</strong></h4><p>To prevent abuse, the API Gateway checks how many requests you&#8217;ve made recently. For example:</p><ul><li><p>If you&#8217;ve made 10 "Place Order" requests in the last minute (maybe by accident), the gateway might block additional requests temporarily and return <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const checkRateLimit = async (userId) =&gt; {
    const key = `rate_limit:order:${userId}`;
    const current = await redis.incr(key);
    
    // If first request in window, set expiry
    if (current === 1) {
        await redis.expire(key, 60); // 1 minute window
    }
    
    return current &lt;= 10; // Allow 10 order requests per minute
};</code></pre><p>This ensures the system remains stable and fair for all users specially during traffic spikes or malicious attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attempts.</p><h4><strong>Step 5: Request Transformation (if needed)</strong></h4><p>If any of these backend services require specific data formats or additional details, the API Gateway transforms the request. </p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>The app sends the delivery address in plain text, but the Delivery Service expects GPS coordinates. The API Gateway converts the address into coordinates before forwarding the request.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const transformRequest = async (originalRequest) =&gt; {
    const address = originalRequest.deliveryAddress;

    // Convert address to GPS coordinates using a geocoding API
    const coordinates = await getCoordinatesFromAddress(address);

    if (!coordinates) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch GPS coordinates');
    }

    // Transform the request for the Delivery Service
    return {
        orderId: originalRequest.orderId,
        customerName: originalRequest.customerName,
        deliveryLocation: {
            latitude: coordinates.lat,
            longitude: coordinates.lng
        },
        deliveryInstructions: originalRequest.instructions || ""
    };
};</code></pre><h4>Step 6: Request Routing</h4><p>The API Gateway now needs to coordinate several backend services to process your order.</p><p>Using <strong>service discovery</strong>, it identifies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Order Service:</strong> To create a new order record.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inventory Service:</strong> To check if the restaurant has your selected items available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment Service:</strong> To process your payment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delivery Service:</strong> To assign a delivery driver to your order.</p></li></ul><p>The gateway dynamically routes the request to these services using a <strong>load balancing</strong> algorithm, ensuring it connects to available and healthy service instances.</p><pre><code>const routeRequest = async (req, serviceType) =&gt; {
    // Get service registry
    const services = await serviceDiscovery.getServices(serviceType);
    
    // Select instance
    const targetService = selectServiceInstance(services);
    
    // Forward request
    return await axios.post(
        `${targetService.url}/api/orders`,
        req.body,
        { headers: req.headers }
    );
};</code></pre><h4><strong>Step 7: Response Handling</strong></h4><p>Once the API Gateway receives the response(s) from the backend service(s), it performs the following tasks:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transformation:</strong> Adjusts the response format or structure to match the client&#8217;s requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caching (Optional):</strong> Stores the response temporarily for frequently accessed data, reducing future latency.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const handleResponse = async (serviceResponse) =&gt; {
    // Transform response if needed
    const transformedResponse = {
        orderId: serviceResponse.order_reference,
        estimatedDelivery: serviceResponse.eta,
        status: serviceResponse.current_status
    };
    
    // Cache response if applicable
    if (serviceResponse.cacheable) {
        await cacheResponse(
            transformedResponse.orderId, 
            transformedResponse
        );
    }
    
    return transformedResponse;
};</code></pre><p>Finally, the API Gateway sends the processed response back to the client in a format they can easily understand.</p><h4>Step 8: Logging &amp; Monitoring</h4><p>Throughout this process, the gateway records important metrics to track each request:</p><pre><code>const logRequest = async (req, res, timing) =&gt; {
    await logger.log({
        timestamp: new Date(),
        path: req.path,
        method: req.method,
        responseTime: timing,
        statusCode: res.statusCode,
        userId: req.user?.id
    });
};</code></pre><div><hr></div><p>Hope you enjoyed reading this article.</p><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like &#10084;&#65039; and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/how-i-mastered-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQ1NjU1MjUyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjE1MjE3MzEsImV4cCI6MTcyNDExMzczMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.2cNY811YEugd5iH9XJQhakBzyahGqF7PcATBlFj5J2w&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/what-is-an-api-gateway?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://blog.algomaster.io/p/what-is-an-api-gateway?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe for free to receive new articles every week.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Checkout my <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ashishps_1/videos">Youtube channel</a></strong> for more in-depth content.</p><p>Follow me on <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishps1/">LinkedIn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ashishps_1">X</a></strong> to stay updated.</p><p>Checkout my <strong><a href="https://github.com/ashishps1">GitHub repositories</a></strong> for free interview preparation resources.</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p><p>See you soon,</p><p>Ashish</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 4.19, the Last Supported Kernel of the Linux 4.x Series, Finally Reaches EOL</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/2047211/linux-419-the-last-supported-kernel-of-the-linux-4x-series-finally-reaches-eol?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sat, 7 Dec 2024 20:50:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Slashdot reader prisoninmate shared this report from 9to5Linux:
Linux kernel 4.19, the last of the Linux 4.x kernel series, has now reached the end of its supported life as announced earlier on the Linux kernel mailing list by kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman. The Linux 4.19 kernel branch was released more than six years ago, on October 22nd, 2018, and it received no less than 325 maintenance updates, the last one being Linux 4.19.325. The biggest highlights of Linux kernel 4.19 were initial Wi-Fi 6 support, the EROFS file system, and a union mount filesystem implementation. Kroah-Hartman said on the mailing list. "This one is finished, it is end-of-life as of right now... It had a good life..."


As a "fun" proof that this one is finished (and that any company saying they care about it really should have their statements validated with facts), I looked at the "unfixed" CVEs from this kernel release. Currently it is a list 983 CVEs long, too long to list here.... Note, this does NOT count the hardware CVEs which kernel.org does not track, and many are sill unfixed in this kernel branch. 

Yes, CVE counts don't mean much these days, but hey, it's a signal of something, right? I take it to mean that no one is caring enough to backport the needed fixes to this branch, which means that you shouldn't be using it anymore. 

Anyway, please move off to a more modern kernel if you were using this one for some reason. Like 6.12.y, the next LTS kernel we will be supporting for multiple years.

 AI assistants coding curriculums
- connectivity tools student learning platforms mobile apps chatbots

One example shared by Amazon: The nonprofit Code.org will use AWS's cloud credits to scale their AI teaching assistant that "has already helped teachers reduce the time they spend assessing students' coding projects by up to 50%." (Amazon's blog post notes that "Improved efficiency means teachers have more time to work on personalized lesson plans and coach students" &mdash; and that Code.org's assistant uses an AWS service for building AI tools...) 

$100 million sounds pretty generous. But long-time Slashdot reader theodp notes the application for the cloud credits limits education organization to $100,000 in credits (though "your organization may be able to apply for a credits expansion" if needed). Do these figures suggest Amazon expects less than 1,000 organizations to apply for free cloud-computing over the next five years? ($100,000,000/$100,000 = 1,000) 

theodp also spotted a GitHub comment from a Code.org software engineer comparing accuracy for its teaching assistant after a switch from GPT-4 Turbo to Claude. Both before and after the switch, the teaching assistant averaged an accuracy rate of 77%, the comment notes. 

I guess that 77% accuracy rate is what Amazon is calling "improved efficiency" that "means teachers have more time to work on personalized lesson plans and coach students." (Maybe you're never to young to learn that AI makes mistakes?)<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Or at least, that seems to be a general sentiment. In this livestream we will explore when and if it can make sense to add Rust to a toolchain. In particular we will explore speedups that might make sense for custom scikit-learn utilities.

New Linux patches from Huawei engineers are preparing new driver support for controlling High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with the ARM-based Kunpeng high performance SoC... 

[I]t would appear there is a new Kunpeng SoC coming that will feature integrated High Bandwidth Memory (HBM).Unless I missed something, this Kunpeng SoC with HBM memory hasn't been formally announced yet and I haven't been able to find any other references short of pointing to prior kernel patches working on this HBM integration... It will be interesting to see what comes of Huawei Kunpeng SoCs with HBM memory and ultimately how well they perform against other AArch64 server processors as well as the Intel Xeon and AMD EPYC competition.

 [F]rom December 1st to December 24th, we will release a fun, daily coding challenge for you to solve on [code-learning platform] Scrimba. Each challenge comes with an introductory screencast called "scrim", some starter code, and then it's your turn to fill in the gaps. 

JavaScriptmas is about coding, learning, and the chance to win exciting prizes. Two lucky coders will be chosen as winners at the end of JavaScriptmas, and each will win a MacBook Air M3, swag from MDN and Scrimba, and a lifetime Scrimba Pro membership (worth ~$200 per year). The Scrimba membership will give you access to all courses, including the Frontend Developer Career Path based on the MDN curriculum. 
Most of the challenges will evolve around JavaScript algorithms. You will also practice subjects like DOM manipulation, UI design, CSS, accessibility, and even a bit of cyber security. The challenges are a collaborative effort from Scrimba teachers, mentors, and MDN content writers, all with the goal of turning you into a more well-rounded web developer. 
Winners will be chosen randomly from everyone who submits correct solutions. We want JavaScriptmas to be accessible for both beginners and experienced developers alike. That said, the more challenges you solve, the better your chances of winning! To maximize your chances, try to solve all 24 challenges and submit them as both regular entries and social entries. You don't have to submit your solutions on the same day they're published &mdash; the deadline for any submission is midnight UTC on Christmas Eve.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The latest SlashData Developer Nation survey found Rust to be the fastest-growing programming language, doubling its users over the past two years. As Rust's adoption continues to accelerate, the demand for a multifaceted ecosystem of quality training will too.
 

Their blog post highlights three examples of the Rust community "creating new pathways for learning Rust" and "addressing the critical need for Rust training in academic settings..."


Rust-Edu operates as a non-profit through Portland State University, with funding from Futurewei. Their mission is to "spread Rust use and development through academic curricula and communities throughout the world, making Rust the language of choice for 'systems programming' in its broadest sense through shared efforts of faculty, students and the Rust community." They focus on three main areas: curriculum development, educational tools, and language improvements... 


teach-rs, pronounced "teachers," is a modular and reusable university course designed for in-person teaching in Rust. Its mission is to introduce Rust in higher education and ensure that more students enter the job market with considerable Rust experience. The teach-rs project provides ready-to-use Rust teaching materials, including slide decks and exercises that can be adapted to various teaching contexts... As an open source permissively licensed project, teach-rs enables educators to share and improve resources, making introducing Rust instruction into their programs more accessible. Many institutions now use teach-rs in their courses, including the Slovak University of Technology, RustIEC (a collaboration between Vrije Universiteit Brussel and KU Leuven), and the University Politehnica of Bucharest. At the time of this writing, teach-rs has nearly 3000 stars on GitHub... 

Under the guidance of The Rust Foundation's Global Rust Coordinator and Rust Nation UK's organizer Ernest Kissiedu, Mordecai Etukudo (Mart) has developed a guide to help educational institutions adopt Rust in their systems. This resource walks organizations through the entire implementation process, from initial assessment to community engagement.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

typically stores:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Basic Details:</strong> Service name, IP, port, and status.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metadata:</strong> Version, environment, region, tags, etc.</p></li><li><p><strong>Health Information:</strong> Health status, last health check.</p></li><li><p><strong>Load Balancing Info:</strong> Weights, priorities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Protocols, certificates.</p></li></ul><p>This abstraction is important in environments where services are constantly being added, removed, or scaled.</p><h2><strong>2. Why is Service Discovery Important?</strong></h2><p>Think about a massive system like <strong>Netflix</strong>, with hundreds of microservices working together. Hardcoding the locations of these services isn&#8217;t scalable. If a service moves to a new server or scales dynamically, it could break the entire system.</p><p><strong>Service discovery</strong> solves this by dynamically and reliably enabling services to locate and communicate with one another.</p><p>Here are its key benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Reduced Manual Configuration:</strong> Services can automatically discover and connect to each other, eliminating the need for manual configuration and hardcoding of network locations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> As new service instances are added or removed, service discovery ensures that other services can seamlessly adapt to the changing environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Service discovery often include health checks, enabling systems to automatically reroute traffic away from failing service instances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplified Management:</strong> Having a central registry of services makes it easier to monitor, manage, and troubleshoot the entire system.</p></li></ul><h2>3. Service Registration Options</h2><p>Service registration is the process where a service announces its availability to a <strong>service registry</strong>, making it discoverable by other services.</p><p>The method of registration can vary depending on the architecture, tools, and deployment environment.</p><p>Here are the most common <strong>service registration options</strong>:</p><h4>3.1. <strong>Manual Registration</strong></h4><p>In manual registration, service details are added to the registry manually by a developer or operator. This approach is simple but not suitable for dynamic systems where services scale or move frequently.</p><h4>3.2. <strong>Self-Registration</strong></h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png" width="565" height="278" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:278,&quot;width&quot;:565,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:22928,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F011bde92-c1ea-4b72-a7fa-6c54e59ef723_565x278.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke-width="1.8" stroke="#000" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M21 3V8M21 8H16M21 8L18 5.29962C16.7056 4.14183 15.1038 3.38328 13.3879 3.11547C11.6719 2.84766 9.9152 3.08203 8.32951 3.79031C6.74382 4.49858 5.39691 5.65051 4.45125 7.10715C3.5056 8.5638 3.00158 10.2629 3 11.9996M3 21V16M3 16H8M3 16L6 18.7C7.29445 19.8578 8.89623 20.6163 10.6121 20.8841C12.3281 21.152 14.0848 20.9176 15.6705 20.2093C17.2562 19.501 18.6031 18.3491 19.5487 16.8925C20.4944 15.4358 20.9984 13.7367 21 12" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></g></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Visualized using <a href="https://dub.sh/IN9jYSm">Multiplayer</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>In self-registration, the service is responsible for registering itself with the service registry when it starts.

Deploy multiple instances of the service registry to avoid single points of failure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automate Registration: </strong>Use self-registration, sidecars, or orchestration tools for dynamic environments.

It has support for resampling techniques which historically have always been used for imbalanced classification use-cases. However, now that we are a few years down the line, it may be time to start rethinking the library. As it turns out, other techniques may be preferable. We talk to the maintainer, Guillaume Lemaitre, to discuss the lessons that have been learned over the last decade.

The imbalanced learn docs can be found here:

Scikit-learn has a great guide on calibrating a classifier, which can be found here:

The dual-model approach has been in place since early 2024, despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's public promotion of Llama as a leading AI model. 

Metamate, previously known as Code Compose, serves Meta's developers and employees with coding support. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, is separately developing an educational AI tool using OpenAI's technology, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joining CZI's AI advisory board.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

But its not the only site offering Christmas-themed programming puzzles:


Hundreds of SQL lovers are trying the daily challenges from the "Advent of SQL" site.

You can sign up for daily emails with webdev challenges from the Advent of JavaScript and Advent of CSS sites. 
The "Advent of No-Code" site challenges you to build something new every day using no-code tools like AI-powered dev environments or the social coding site Val Town.
 TryHackMe.com is publishing "beginner-friendly, daily gamified cyber security challenges" in an event they're calling the "Advent of Cyber."

And Norway's biggest chess club (founded by world champion Magnus Carlsen) has even launched a site with daily chess puzzles called &mdash; what else? &mdash; Advent of Chess. (It promises at the end of the event someone will win a chessboard signed by Magnus Carlsen).

PyTorch for Control Systems and Decision Making // MLOps Podcast #276 with Vincent Moens, Research Engineer at Meta.

// Abstract
PyTorch is widely adopted across the machine learning community for its flexibility and ease of use in applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, supporting reinforcement learning, decision-making, and control communities is equally crucial, as these fields drive innovation in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and game-playing. This podcast explores the intersection of PyTorch and these fields, covering practical tips and tricks for working with PyTorch, an in-depth look at TorchRL, and discussions on debugging techniques, optimization strategies, and testing frameworks. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how to effectively use PyTorch for control systems and decision-making applications.

In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, nor any signs of alien intelligence anywhere in the observable universe, leading him to ask, &#x201C;Where is everybody?&#x201D;</blockquote><p>To me, this is a compelling argument, in the same way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel?ref=blog.codinghorror.com#Absence_of_time_travelers_from_the_future" rel="noreferrer">the lack of evidence of any time travellers</a> is:</p><blockquote>Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.</blockquote><p>It seems, to me at least, clear evidence that time travel is not possible, given the enormous amount of time behind us.

And <em>faster</em>. And so does intelligent life. </p><blockquote>Why build planet-size anything when the real action is in the small things? Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster. Personally, I have a feeling really advanced life eventually does away with all physical stuff that slows you down as soon as they can, and enters <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-infinite-space-between-words/" rel="noreferrer">the infinite spaces between</a>:</p><blockquote>This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don&#x2019;t see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we&#x2019;re alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence.&#xA0;<strong>It could be that it&#x2019;s the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable.</strong>&#xA0;This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be &#x2013; and this is, of course, speculation &#x2013; that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance.

"The veteran kernel developer believes we're at a tipping point of seeing more upstream Rust drivers ahead," reports Phoronix:

These Rust char/misc changes are on top of the main Rust pull for Linux 6.13 that brought 3k lines of code for providing more Rust infrastructure. Linux 6.13 separately is also bringing Rust file abstractions.
 

"Sorry for doing this at the end of the merge window," Greg Kroah-Hartman wrote in the pull request, explaining that "conference and holiday travel got in the way on my side (hence the 5am pull request emails...)"

Loads of things in here... 
 &mdash; Rust misc driver bindings and other rust changes to make misc drivers actually possible. I think this is the tipping point, expect to see way more rust drivers going forward now that these bindings are present. 
Next merge window hopefully we will have pci and platform drivers working, which will fully enable almost all driver subsystems to start accepting (or at least getting) rust drivers. This is the end result of a lot of work from a lot of people, congrats to all of them for getting this far, you've proved many of us wrong in the best way possible, working code :)

As one of the admins of <a href="https://woof.group">woof.group</a>, I wrote about some of the <a href="https://blog.woof.group/announcements/considering-large-instance-federation">potential risks and rewards</a> of federating with Threads. We decided to <a href="https://blog.woof.group/announcements/deferring-threads-federation">wait and see</a>.</p>
<p>In my queer and leather circles, Facebook and Instagram have been generally understood as hostile environments for over a decade. In 2014, their <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community">“Real Name” policy</a> made life particularly difficult for trans people, drag queens, sex workers, and people who, for various reasons, needed to keep their real name disconnected from their queer life. My friends have been repeatedly suspended from both platforms for showing too much skin, or using the peach emoji. Meta’s moderation has been aggressive, opaque, and wildly inconsistent: sometimes full nudity is fine; other times a kiss or swimsuit is beyond the line. In some circles, maintaining a series of backup accounts in advance of one’s ban became de rigueur.</p>
<p>I’d hoped that federation between Threads and the broader Fediverse might allow a <a href="https://blog.woof.group/mods/the-shape-of-social-space">more nuanced spectrum</a> of moderation norms. Threads might opt for a more conservative environment locally, but through federation, allow their users to interact with friends on instances with more liberal norms. Conversely, most of my real-life friends are still on Meta services—I’d love to see their posts and chat with them again. Threads could communicate with Gay Fedi (using the term in the broadest sense), and de-rank or hide content they don’t like on a per-post or per-account basis.</p>
<p>This world seems technically feasible. Meta reports <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/threads-now-has-275m-monthly-active-users/">275 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs)</a>, and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1092227/facebook-product-dau/">three billion</a> accross other Meta services. Fediverse has something like <a href="https://fedidb.org/">one million MAUs across various instances</a>. This is not a large jump in processing or storage; nor would it seem to require a large increase in moderation staff. Threads has already committed to doing the requisite engineering, user experience, and legal work to allow federation across a broad range of instances. Meta is swimming in cash.</p>
<p>All this seems a moot point. A year and a half later, Threads <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24107998/threads-fediverse-mastodon-how-to">is barely half federated</a>. It publishes Threads posts to the world, but only if you dig in to the settings and check the “Fediverse Sharing” box. Threads users can see replies to their posts, but can’t talk back. Threads users can’t mention others, see mentions from other people, or follow anyone outside Threads. This may work for syndication, but is essentially unusable for conversation.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Threads users can’t follow or see mentions from people on other instances, Threads has already <a href="https://www.threads.net/moderated_servers">opted to block</a> a slew of instances where gay &amp; leather people congregate. Threads blocks <a href="https://hypno.social">hypno.social</a>, <a href="rubber.social">rubber.social</a>, <a href="https://4bear.com">4bear.com</a>, <a href="https://nsfw.lgbt">nsfw.lgbt</a>, <a href="https://kinkyelephant.com">kinkyelephant.com</a>, <a href="https://kinktroet.social">kinktroet.social</a>, <a href="https://barkclub.xyz">barkclub.xyz</a>, <a href="https://mastobate.social">mastobate.social</a>, and <a href="https://kinky.business">kinky.business</a>. They also block the (now-defunct) instances <a href="https://bear.community">bear.community</a>, <a href="https://gaybdsm.group">gaybdsm.group</a>, and <a href="https://gearheads.social">gearheads.social</a>. They block more general queer-friendly instances like <a href="https://bark.lgbt">bark.lgbt</a>, <a href="https://super-gay.co">super-gay.co</a>, <a href="https://gay.camera">gay.camera</a>, and <a href="https://gaygeek.social">gaygeek.social</a>. They block sex-positive instances like <a href="https://nsfwphotography.social">nsfwphotography.social</a>, <a href="https://nsfw.social">nsfw.social</a>, and <a href="https://net4sw.com">net4sw.com</a>. All these instances are blocked for having “violated our Community Standards or Terms of Use”. Others like <a href="https://fisting.social">fisting.social</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.hypnoguys.com">mastodon.hypnoguys.com</a>, <a href="https://abdl.link">abdl.link</a>, <a href="https://qaf.men">qaf.men</a>, and <a href="https://social.rubber.family">social.rubber.family</a>, are blocked for having “no publicly accessible feed”. I don’t know what this means: hypnoguys.social, for instance, has the usual Mastodon <a href="https://mastodon.hypnoguys.com/public/local">publically accessible local feed</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like these instances are hotbeds of spam, hate speech, or harassment: woof.group federates heavily with most of the servers I mentioned above, and we rarely have problems with their moderation. Most have reasonable and enforced media policies requiring sensitive-media flags for genitals, heavy play, and so on. Those policies are generally speaking looser than Threads (woof.group, for instance, allows butts!) but there are plenty of accounts and posts on these instances which would be anodyne under Threads’ rules.</p>
<p>I am shocked that woof.group is <em>not</em> on Threads’ blocklist yet. We have similar users who post similar things. Our content policies are broadly similar—several of the instances Threads blocks actually adopted woof.group’s specific policy language. I doubt it’s our size: Threads blocks several instances with less than ten MAUs, and woof.group has over seven hundred.</p>
<p>I’ve been out of the valley for nearly a decade, and I don’t have insight into Meta’s policies or decision-making. I’m sure Threads has their reasons. Whatever they are, Threads, like all of Meta’s services, feels distinctly uncomfortable with sex, and sexual expression is a vibrant aspect of gay culture.</p>
<p>This is part of why I started woof.group: we deserve spaces moderated with our subculture in mind. But I also hoped that by designing a moderation policy which compromised with normative sensibilities, we might retain connections to a broader set of publics. This particular leather bar need not be an invite-only clubhouse; it can be a part of a walkable neighborhood. For nearly five years we’ve kept that balance, retaining open federation with most all the Fediverse. I get the sense that Threads intends to wall its users off from our world altogether—to make “bad gays” invisible.

class="image-caption"><strong>Visualized using <a href="https://dub.sh/HCUjQvL">Multiplayer</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>This seamless switching&#8212;enabled by modern CPU designs&#8212;creates the <strong>illusion of multitasking </strong>and<strong> </strong>gives the appearance of tasks running in parallel.</p><p>However, it&#8217;s important to note <strong>this is not parallel</strong>. <strong>This is concurrent</strong>.</p><p>Concurrency is primarily achieved using <strong>threads</strong>, which are the smallest units of execution within a process. The CPU switches between threads to handle multiple tasks concurrently, ensuring the system remains responsive.</p><p>The primary objective of concurrency is to <strong>maximize CPU utilization</strong> by minimizing idle time.</p><p><strong>For example:</strong></p><ul><li><p>When one thread or process is waiting for I/O operations, database transactions, or external program launches, the CPU can allocate resources to another thread.</p></li></ul><p>This ensures the CPU remains productive, even when individual tasks are stalled.</p><h3><strong>How Does Concurrency Works?</strong></h3><p>Concurrency in a CPU is achieved through <strong>context switching</strong>. </p><p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Context Saving</strong>: When the CPU switches from one task to another, it saves the current task's state (e.g., program counter, registers) in memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Context Loading</strong>: The CPU then loads the context of the next task and continues executing it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rapid Switching</strong>: The CPU repeats this process, switching between tasks so quickly that it seems like they are running simultaneously.</p></li></ol><h4>The Cost of Context Switching</h4><p>While context switching enables concurrency, it also introduces <strong>overhead</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Every switch requires saving and restoring task states, which consumes both time and resources.</p></li><li><p>Excessive context switching can degrade performance by increasing CPU overhead.</p></li></ul><h3>Real-World Examples of Concurrency</h3><h4>1. <strong>Web Browsers</strong></h4><p>Modern web browsers perform multiple tasks concurrently:</p><ul><li><p>Rendering web pages (HTML/CSS).</p></li><li><p>Fetching external resources like images and scripts.</p></li><li><p>Responding to user actions such as clicks and scrolling.</p></li></ul><p>Each of these tasks is managed by separate threads, ensuring the browser remains responsive while loading and displaying content.</p><h4><strong>2. Web Servers</strong></h4><p>Web servers like Apache or Nginx handle multiple client requests concurrently:</p><ul><li><p>Each request is processed independently using threads or asynchronous I/O.</p></li><li><p>For example, a server can handle multiple users loading different pages simultaneously without blocking.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>3. Chat Applications</strong></h4><p>Chat applications perform several operations concurrently:</p><ul><li><p>Processing incoming messages.</p></li><li><p>Updating the user interface with new messages.</p></li><li><p>Sending outgoing messages.</p></li></ul><p>This ensures smooth real-time communication without delays or freezes.</p><h4><strong>4. Video Games</strong></h4><p>Video games rely heavily on concurrency to deliver an immersive experience:</p><ul><li><p>Rendering graphics.</p></li><li><p>Processing user input (e.g., character movement).</p></li><li><p>Simulating physics.</p></li><li><p>Playing background audio.</p></li></ul><p>For example, while a player moves a character, the game simultaneously updates the environment and plays music, ensuring smooth gameplay.</p><h3>Code Example</h3><p>Most popular programming languages come with inbuilt support for creating and managing threads.</p><p>Here's an example of a

Concurrency and Parallelism Combinations</h2><h4><strong>4.1 Concurrent, Not Parallel</strong></h4><p>An application can be concurrent without being parallel. In this case:</p><ul><li><p>The application makes progress on multiple tasks at the same time <strong>seemingly</strong> (concurrently).</p></li><li><p>However, it achieves this by <strong>switching</strong> between tasks rapidly, rather than running them simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Example</strong>: A single-core CPU alternating between tasks, giving the illusion of multitasking.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>4.2 Parallel, Not Concurrent</strong></h4><p>An application can be parallel without being concurrent. Here:</p><ul><li><p>A single task is divided into subtasks, and these subtasks are executed simultaneously on separate cores.</p></li><li><p>There is no overlap between tasks; one task (and its subtasks) completes before the next task starts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Example</strong>: Video rendering, where a single video is divided into frames, and each frame is processed in parallel.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>4.3 Neither Concurrent Nor Parallel</strong></h4><p>Some applications are neither concurrent nor parallel. This means:</p><ul><li><p>Tasks are executed sequentially, one at a time, without any overlap or parallel execution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Example</strong>: A single-core CPU where only one task is processed, and it completes fully before the next task begins.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>4.4 Concurrent and Parallel</strong></h4><p>An application can be both <strong>concurrent and parallel</strong>, combining the strengths of both execution models.</p><p>In this approach:</p><ol><li><p>Multiple tasks make progress at the same time, and each task is also divided into subtasks that are executed in parallel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Example</strong>: A Multi-core CPU where some subtasks run concurrently on the same core, while others run in parallel on separate cores.</p></li></ol><p></p><div

These subtasks are executed by multiple threads.
