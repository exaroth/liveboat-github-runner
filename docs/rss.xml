According to NBC News, "health officials considered the case to be the "country's first severe human H5N1 infection." From the report: The Louisiana Department of Health said the patient had been exposed to a combination of a backyard flock and wild birds. "The Department expresses its deepest condolences to the patient's family and friends as they mourn the loss of their loved one," it said in a statement. "Due to patient confidentiality and respect for the family, this will be the final update about the patient." All but one of the [67] human bird flu infections confirmed so far in the U.S. were diagnosed in the last 10 months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most cases have been relatively mild, with symptoms including pinkeye, coughs or sneezes. The majority of the patients became sick after exposure to infected cattle or poultry. The Louisiana patient was the first case linked to exposure to a backyard flock. [...]
 
The CDC maintains that the immediate risk to public health is low. Public health officials have not found any evidence that the virus has spread person-to-person, which would mark a dire step in bird flu's evolution. "While tragic, a death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death," the agency said in a statement on Monday. "There are no concerning virologic changes actively spreading in wild birds, poultry, or cows that would raise the risk to human health," the statement added. However, samples of the virus collected from the Louisiana patient showed signs of mutations that could make it more transmissible to humans, according to the agency.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

It's being led by former OpenAI Sora co-lead Tim Brooks and builds on Google's Gemini, Veo, and Genie projects. "DeepMind has ambitious plans to make massive generative models that simulate the world," Brooks wrote on X. "I'm hiring for a new team with this mission." TechCrunch reports: According to job listings Brooks linked to in his post, the new modeling team will collaborate with and build on work from Google's Gemini, Veo, and Genie teams to tackle "critical new problems" and scale models "to the highest levels of compute." Gemini is Google's flagship series of AI models for tasks like analyzing images and generating text, while Veo is Google's own video generation model. As for Genie, it's Google's take on a world model -- AI that can simulate games and 3D environments in real time. Google's latest Genie model, previewed in December, can generate a massive variety of playable 3D worlds.
 
"We believe scaling [AI training] on video and multimodal data is on the critical path to artificial general intelligence," reads one of the job descriptions. Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, generally refers to AI that can accomplish any task a human can. "World models will power numerous domains, such as visual reasoning and simulation, planning for embodied agents, and real-time interactive entertainment." Per the description, Brooks' new team will look to develop "real-time interactive generation" tools on top of the models they build, and study how to integrate their models with existing multimodal models such as Gemini.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

IGN reports: The AMD Zen 2 Extreme, along with lower-specced cousins the Z2 and Z2 Go, are powered by Zen 5 CPU cores. While the Zen 2 Extreme is using a RDNA 3.5-based GPU, the Z2 and Z2 Go are still using RDNA 3 and RDNA 2, respectively. This creates an entire family of APUs (Advanced Processing Units) for handheld gaming PCs that should hopefully cause the price of handhelds to go down a bit.
 
With the Z2 Extreme, AMD is hoping to dramatically improve battery life, while also delivering console-like gaming performance to devices like the Lenovo Legion Go. By and large, the biggest limiting factor of these handhelds, especially at the high end, is how quickly their batteries drain when playing demanding games away from a wall outlet. The company also introduced the "Fire Range" HX3D processors for gaming laptops, leveraging 3D V-cache technology for enhanced gaming performance and efficiency. "All of these mobile chipsets, from 'Fire Range' HX3D to the AMD Z2 Extreme, will end up in gaming laptops and handhelds over the next few months," adds IGN.
 
AMD published a press release with additional details and specifications.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday. The annually updated list (PDF) of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.
 
U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake." It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business." CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military related activities." A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error."
 
While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies.
Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations, but remain on the updated list. The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co and China Telecommunications Corporation.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Since taking charge of X -- formerly known as Twitter -- Elon Musk has used the social media platform as a platform for his own political views. And, after spending millions of dollars helping to secure Donald Trump’s return to the White House, he's now wading into European politics -- expressing support for far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe, including here in Germany. In December, he tweeted his support for the far-right, Alternative for Germany party -- or AfD. With a general election in February, the AfD is polling second - and parts of the party are being monitored by German domestic security services as "possible threats to democracy". 

He's also attacked Germany's leaders, saying that Chancellor Olaf Scholz, "should resign immediately," and calling him an "incompetent fool". And of German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, he said, "Steinmeier is an anti-democratic tyrant! Shame on him".  Berlin has accused Elon Musk of election interference.

The first residents will be Toyota employees and affiliates, but the city aims to expand to include "external inventors and their families." The Verge reports: Toyota said it completed "phase 1" of the construction, with the official launch planned for 2025. "Woven City is more than just a place to live, work, and play," Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda said during today's press conference at CES. "Woven City is a place where people can invent and develop all kinds of new products and ideas. It's a living laboratory where the residents are willing participants, giving inventors the opportunity to freely test their ideas in a secure, real-life setting." [...] In fall 2025, Toyota said it will welcome the first 100 residents to Woven City, all of whom will be employees of Toyota or its subsidiary, Woven by Toyota. The community will gradually expand to include "external inventors and their families" who will be invited to relocate to the new city. In total, the first phase of the city will eventually house 360 residents, Toyota says.
 
Toyota dubs these first residents "Weavers," adding that they are people who "share a passion for the 'expansion of mobility' and a commitment to building a more flourishing society. Through their participation in co-creation activities, Weavers will contribute to realizing the full potential of Woven City." That said, the first "inventors" confirmed for Woven City are mostly in the food services business, including a vending machine company and a startup that wants to explore "the potential value of coffee through futuristic cafe experiences." Toyoda mentioned several other ideas during his press conference, including high-powered motorized wheelchairs for people with disabilities who want to experience the thrill of racing. He also pitched the idea of a personal drone that follows joggers for added security, and "pet robots" for elderly people.
 
The Woven City site, which is located at the base of Mount Fuji, includes buildings that are designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels. The goal, through phase 2 and subsequent phases, is to build enough housing and facilities for up to 2,000 people to live year-around, with utilities powered by the company's hydrogen fuel cell technology. The site is private for now, though Toyota says it plans on inviting the general public to see it in 2026. The name "Woven City" is a reference to weaving together three different types of streets or pathways, each for a specific type of user. One street would be for faster vehicles only. The second would be a mix of lower-speed personal mobility vehicles, like bikes and scooters, as well as pedestrians. And the third would be a park-like promenade for pedestrians only. Japan first announced the "prototype city of the future" at CES 2020.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

It also found that heavy TikTok usage correlates with more favorable views of China's human rights record. The findings come a Supreme Court hearing later this week on whether the federal government can ban TikTok. Gizmodo reports: The new peer-reviewed paper, which was first reported by The Free Press, begins by examining whether content on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube related to the keywords "Tiananmen," "Tibet," "Uyghur," and "Xinjiang" tends to display pro- or anti-CCP sentiment. The researchers found that TikTok's algorithm didn't necessarily surface more pro-CCP content in response to searches for those terms, but it delivered fewer anti-CCP posts than did Instagram or YouTube and significantly more posts that were irrelevant to the subject.
 
In the second stage of their study, the NCRI team tested whether the lower performance of anti-CCP content was a result of less user engagement (likes and comments) with those posts. They found that TikTok users "liked or commented on anti-CCP content nearly four times as much as they liked or commented on pro-CCP content, yet the search algorithm produced nearly three times as much pro-CCP content" while there was no similar discrepancy on Instagram or YouTube.
 
Finally, the researchers surveyed 1,214 Americans about their social media usage and their views on China's human rights record. The more time users spent on any social media platform, the more likely they were to have favorable views of China's human rights record, the survey showed. Users were particularly more likely to have favorable views if they spent more than three hours a day using TikTok. The researchers wrote that they could not definitively conclude that spending more time on TikTok resulted in more positive views of China, but "taken together, the findings from these three studies raise the distinct possibility that TikTok is a vehicle for CCP propaganda."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

For most, the answer was to buy. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) dominated because it was cheaper, faster, and easier than building proprietary software from scratch. But things have changed now that many tasks within SaaS companies and many features within SaaS products can now be completed by your own AI.  </p>
<p>\
Today, more companies are realizing that building, once seen as prohibitively expensive, is not just viable—it’s becoming the superior option—offering more customization and significantly lower labor costs.</p>
<h3 id="klarnaandibmthecorporateshiftfromlabortoaihasalreadybegun">Klarna and IBM: The Corporate Shift From Labor to AI Has Already Begun</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/TByPx42kOdfCJW2zO2f7i5O6tku2-7x038ed.jpeg" alt="Yahoo Finance & Fox News Coverage of the Klarna and IBM CEOs respectively https://finance.yahoo.com/news/klarna-ceo-says-company-stopped-205638110.html https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/ibm-ceo-warns-ai-could-wipe-out-many-jobs-within-5-years?t " /></p>
<p>\
Look at Klarna. The fintech giant recently replaced significant portions of its workforce with AI-driven automation. IBM did something similar, cutting hiring for roles such as customer support agents, data entry clerks, financial analysts, software testers, and even junior developers, which they knew would soon be automated by AI. But it’s not just these high-profile examples. </p>
<p>\
This shift is happening across industries like finance, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing, driven by the simple fact that AI is reducing the complexity of software development.</p>
<p>\
The key reason SaaS took off was that building software was difficult, requiring large teams of engineers, months (if not years) of development, and significant ongoing maintenance. Now, AI is significantly lowering those barriers, making development more accessible while still requiring ongoing maintenance and updates. Companies no longer need to license software for every function because they can generate their own AI-powered solutions dynamically. </p>
<p>\
For example, AI-driven automation is eating into Salesforce’s subscription market cap as companies build their own custom CRM tools, reducing dependence on third-party SaaS providers. The reliance on third-party software vendors is diminishing, and enterprises that recognize this early are the ones getting ahead.</p>
<h3 id="thenewbuyvsbuilddebate">The New Buy vs. Build Debate</h3>
<p>Buying SaaS used to make sense because it let companies focus on their core business instead of wasting time building and maintaining internal tools. Salesforce, HubSpot, and Workday grew by convincing enterprises that outsourcing software to specialists was the smart move. But AI changes the game. Now, building isn’t just cheaper—it’s better. Here’s why:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Customization:</strong> AI enables businesses to tailor software precisely to their needs rather than force-fitting workflows into rigid SaaS platforms. For instance, companies like Netflix are leveraging AI to create highly customized content recommendation engines rather than relying on off-the-shelf solutions.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Once AI-powered tools are set up, they can operate with minimal human intervention, reducing ongoing licensing and staffing costs. Tesla, for example, has reduced reliance on third-party software vendors by developing AI-driven automation for manufacturing and quality control.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faster Iteration:</strong> Enterprises can update and refine AI-driven tools on demand rather than waiting for vendors to release updates. Amazon continuously refines its AI-driven logistics and warehouse management systems to improve efficiency without waiting for external software updates.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Ownership:</strong> Companies no longer need to send valuable proprietary data to third-party vendors. Apple has emphasized data privacy by developing its own AI models for on-device processing, reducing reliance on external cloud-based AI services.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\
For decades, enterprises made peace with SaaS limitations, but AI reduces the need for those compromises.</p>
<h3 id="theinfrastructureadvantagewhowins">The Infrastructure Advantage: Who Wins?</h3>
<p>So if AI is making custom software development easier and more attractive than SaaS, who benefits the most? The answer lies in infrastructure. In the early days of the cloud, companies realized that managing their own data centers was inefficient. AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure took over, turning infrastructure into a commodity and becoming the backbone of the Internet. Now, a similar battle is playing out in AI.</p>
<p>\
The companies that win will be those that control AI compute infrastructure. OpenAI, Anthropic, and other model providers are competing for dominance, but their fate ultimately depends on access to the real power brokers: those who control chips, energy, and data centers.</p>
<p>\
Nvidia, Intel, and AMD own the GPU market. AWS, Google, and Microsoft control hyperscale cloud computing. Enterprises that recognize this are increasingly bypassing external AI providers and optimizing their own AI stacks. The closer they are to the infrastructure layer, the more leverage they have.</p>
<h3 id="saasvendorsareinawholelottatrouble">SaaS Vendors Are in a Whole Lotta’ Trouble</h3>
<p>SaaS companies should be worried. The economic model that made them dominant—recurring revenue through subscription licensing—relies on the assumption that building software is too costly for most businesses. That assumption is breaking down. Take enterprise automation tools like Zapier or UIPath. Five years ago, companies paid them hefty fees for automation. </p>
<p>\
Today, those same companies can use AI to write scripts that handle automation on demand, tailored to their specific workflows. CRM platforms, ERP systems, and customer service software all face the same challenge: AI enables companies to replace generic, expensive SaaS solutions with custom-built, AI-powered tools that are cheaper and more effective.</p>
<p>\
This isn’t just a small shift. It’s an existential crisis for SaaS vendors who have spent years building walled gardens around their platforms. When enterprises no longer need to play inside those walls, the foundations of the SaaS business model begin to erode.</p>
<h3 id="thenewenterprisesoftwaredevelopmentplaybook">The New Enterprise Software Development Playbook</h3>
<p>Forward-thinking enterprises are already adjusting. They’re reducing reliance on third-party SaaS vendors and investing in AI-powered internal tools. Here’s what the winning strategy looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Control Compute:</strong> Companies are moving from renting AI services to controlling their own compute resources. For example, OpenAI has begun building its own AI supercomputers to reduce reliance on external cloud providers.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AI-Native Development:</strong> Instead of licensing SaaS, enterprises are using AI to generate and maintain their own software dynamically. Shopify, for example, has implemented AI-driven code generation to streamline backend development and reduce dependency on third-party software solutions.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p><strong>API-First Thinking:</strong> Businesses are integrating AI into their core workflows through APIs rather than relying on bloated SaaS interfaces. Stripe has heavily invested in AI-powered financial APIs to enhance fraud detection and transaction efficiency.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security & Compliance:</strong> By keeping AI workloads in-house, enterprises avoid the compliance risks of sending sensitive data to third-party SaaS platforms. JPMorgan Chase has developed proprietary AI-driven financial analytics platforms to maintain data security and regulatory compliance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>\
The smartest companies aren’t just replacing SaaS—they’re designing their entire tech stacks around AI-native architectures. The end goal isn’t just cost-cutting; it’s agility, security, and ownership.</p>
<h3 id="aitoconsumesaasandbeyond">AI to Consume SaaS and Beyond</h3>
<p>SaaS isn’t going to disappear overnight, with the market cap of the global SaaS industry currently exceeding $3 trillion, but its dominance is slipping. AI is changing the economics of software development, making in-house solutions not just viable, but preferable. Companies that recognize this now will gain an edge. But beyond simply taking market share from SaaS, AI is expanding the overall market by creating efficiencies that reduce labor hours and unlock new economic opportunities. </p>
<p>\
Instead of just shifting dollars from software subscriptions to AI-powered internal solutions, businesses are using AI to optimize processes, automate routine tasks, and augment human capabilities. This shift not only lowers operational costs but also increases productivity, allowing companies to scale faster and compete more effectively. </p>
<p>\
Tesla has developed in-house AI-powered automation to streamline manufacturing, JPMorgan Chase has built proprietary AI-driven financial analytics platforms, and Netflix has created its own AI-enhanced content recommendation system—each reducing reliance on third-party SaaS providers. </p>
<p>\
Those who continue relying on SaaS vendors may find themselves constrained by costly and less adaptable solutions. The lesson from past tech revolutions is clear: the real power belongs to those who control the infrastructure. Just as cloud computing reshaped enterprise IT, AI is reshaping enterprise software. The winners won’t be the SaaS providers of yesterday. They’ll be the companies that own their AI stacks, control their compute, and move faster than the competition.</p>
<p>\
If you’re still debating buy vs. build, the answer is already clear: AI makes building the better choice.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Volkswagen&apos;s unique history could cause its downfall | Business Beyond</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpEw0QRilGs</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 22:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest car maker, is in crisis.

Plugin authors can write them in any Wasm-compatible language and you&#39;re off to the races with your choice among various excellent and safe Wasm runtimes for Rust, including ones optimized for embedded environments (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi">wasmi</a>).</p> <h1>Not So Easy</h1> <p>Unfortunately, you&#39;re going to find out (in early 2025) that examples of this often-mentioned use case are hard to come by, and that so much of the documentation is irrelevant, confusing, incomplete, or just out of date, as things have been moving quite quickly in the Wasm world.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve read Surma&#39;s <a href="https://surma.dev/things/rust-to-webassembly/">Rust to WebAssembly the hard way</a> (highly recommended starting point!) then you might feel quite confident in your ability to build <code>.wasm</code> modules, load them into Rust, call functions in them, and expose functions to them. But the hard way becomes a dead end as you realize something quite critical: Wasm only supports the transfer of just primitive numeric types, namely integers and floats (and not even unsigned integers). This is an intentional and understandable design choice to keep Wasm lean and mean and agnostic to any specific implementation.</p> <p>But this means that if you want to transfer something as basic as a string or a vector then you&#39;ll have the delve deep into the the Wasm memory model. People have come up with various solutions for Rust, from piggy-backing on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ffi/struct.CString.html">std::ffi::CString</a> to exposing custom malloc/free functions to the Wasm module. But not only are these solutions painful, they would obviously need to be ported to every language we want to support, each with its own string and array models. There was, and still is, a need for some kind of standard, built on top of Wasm, that would support higher-level constructs in a portable way.</p> <h1>The Temporary Solution</h1> <p>It took some time for the community to rally around one. For a while, a promising proposal was Wasm Interfaces (WAI). This was <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wai">pioneered by Wasmer</a>, where the <a href="https://docs.wasmer.io/wai">documentation</a> still points to it as &quot;the&quot; solution (early 2025). As usual in the Wasm world, even that documentation can only take you so far. None of it actually mentions hosting WAI in Rust! And it only shows importing interfaces, not exporting them, though I have managed to learn how to handle exports by delving into the WAI tooling source code. The idea behind WAI is that you describe your interface in a <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wai/blob/main/WAI.md"><code>.wai</code> file</a> and use tooling (e.g. macros) to generate the boilerplate code for clients and hosts, a lot like how things work with RPC protocols (e.g. protobufs).</p> <p>WAI had not been widely adopted, however it does work and is also quite straightforward. We won&#39;t be using it in this example, but it&#39;s useful to be aware of its existence.</p> <h1>The Promising Solution</h1> <p>But the consensus now seems to be around the <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">Wasm Component Model</a>, which expands on WAI with proper namespacing, resources, and richer custom data types. The Component Model is actually part of WASI, and indeed is being used to provide the WASI extensions. So, what&#39;s <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>? It&#39;s an initiative by the community to deliver a set of common APIs on top of Wasm for accessing streams, like files and stdout/stderr, network sockets, and eventually threads. I say &quot;eventually&quot; because WASI is still very much a work in progress. As of now (early 2025) we just got &quot;preview 2&quot; of it. Luckily, Rust can target &quot;wasip2&quot;, meaning that it can be used to create the latest and greatest Components. Though, note that wasip2 does produce larger minimal <code>.wasm</code> files than WAI due to the inclusion of the machinery for the Component Model.</p> <p>Like WAI, the Component Model relies on an interface definition file, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md"><code>.wit</code></a>. And <a href="https://wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime</a> has the tooling for it! Yay! So, are we finally off to the races with our plugin system?</p> <p>Not so fast. Again, finding examples and straightforward documentation is not easy. Wasmtime is a very comprehensive and performative implementation, but it&#39;s also designed by committee and has a lot of contributors. And due to the fast-moving nature of these things, what you find might not represent what is actually going on or what you should be using.</p> <h1>Finally We Get to the Point</h1> <p>All that to say, that&#39;s why I created this repository. It&#39;s intended to be a minimal and straightforward example of how to build plugins in Rust (as Components) and how to host them in your application using Wasmtime and its WIT tooling. Well, at least for early 2025... As of now it does not demonstrate the more advanced features of WIT, such as custom data types, but I might add those in the future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/emblemparade"> /u/emblemparade </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hvaz5f/rust_wasm_plugins_example/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hvaz5f/rust_wasm_plugins_example/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Toyota’s Woven City is open for business and looking for startups</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/toyotas-woven-city-is-open-for-business-and-looking-for-startups/</link><author>Kirsten Korosec</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 21:47:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toyota Motor Chairman Akio Toyoda revealed Monday at CES 2025 his vision for a living laboratory chock-full of startups and technology.

<p>Last week, I watched Sarah break down in the middle of our mastermind meeting.</p>
<p>\
She runs a thriving design agency, the kind that big tech companies fight to work with.&nbsp;<strong>Revenue is up 200% this year</strong>. Her team has grown from just her to fifteen talented designers. She just landed a dream contract with a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>\
And yet, there she sat, barely holding back tears while scrolling through dozens of Slack messages from a client who had been messaging her throughout the night.</p>
<p>\
<em>"I know I need to set better boundaries,"</em>&nbsp;she whispered, her voice shaking.&nbsp;<em>"But what if they get angry? What if they leave? What if word gets out that I'm 'difficult' to work with?"</em></p>
<p>\
That's when it hit me. Sarah's fear of setting boundaries wasn't just a personal struggle – it was the&nbsp;<strong>exact evidence</strong>&nbsp;she needed them most.</p>
<p>\
Think about that for a moment.</p>
<p>\
The same drive that makes entrepreneurs successful – our desire to help, to deliver value, to exceed expectations – can become the very thing that threatens to break us. It's what I call the&nbsp;<strong>Success Trap</strong>: the better you get at serving others, the worse you become at protecting yourself.</p>
<p>\
Three years ago, Sarah celebrated when clients would text her directly.&nbsp;<em>It meant they trusted her.</em></p>
<p>\
Two years ago, she prided herself on being "always available."&nbsp;<em>It showed her dedication.</em></p>
<p>\
Last year, working weekends was a badge of honor.&nbsp;<em>It proved her commitment.</em></p>
<p>\
But now? Those same behaviors weren't signs of success anymore. They had become what I call&nbsp;<strong>golden handcuffs</strong>&nbsp;– self-imposed constraints masquerading as customer service.</p>
<p>\
Her success hadn't disappeared. Her standards for self-preservation just hadn't kept pace with her growth. And in the gap between where her business had scaled and where her boundaries remained stuck in startup mode, she was quietly drowning.</p>
<p>\
Sarah isn't alone. This pattern shows up in nearly every successful entrepreneur's journey once you start looking for it. And it always starts with the same dangerous belief:&nbsp;<strong>that our availability equals our value</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="theparadoxofentrepreneurialpeoplepleasing">The Paradox of Entrepreneurial People-Pleasing</h2>
<p>Here's what nobody tells you about scaling a business:&nbsp;<strong>success amplifies every boundary weakness</strong>&nbsp;you haven't addressed.</p>
<p>\
Let me show you how deep this goes.</p>
<p>\
Last month (at various events), I spoke with thirty founders who'd crossed the $1M revenue mark. I asked them one simple question:&nbsp;<em>"What's the hardest part of growing?"</em></p>
<p>\
Twenty-six of them said some version of the same thing:&nbsp;<strong>managing increasing demands on their time and energy</strong>.</p>
<p>\
But here's what fascinated me – the founders who struggled most with boundaries weren't the rookies. They were the&nbsp;<strong>high-performing veterans</strong>&nbsp;who'd built their success on being exceptional at serving others.</p>
<p>\
It's what I call the&nbsp;<strong>People-Pleasing Paradox</strong>:&nbsp;<em>The better you get at delighting others, the harder it becomes to disappoint them.</em></p>
<p>\
Think about the logic that traps us:</p>
<p>\
A client texts at midnight. We respond because&nbsp;<em>"that's what great service looks like."</em></p>
<p>\
An investor wants a Saturday meeting. We agree because&nbsp;<em>"that's what committed founders do."</em></p>
<p>\
A team member has a crisis on our day off. We jump in because&nbsp;<em>"that's what good leaders do."</em></p>
<p>\
Each time we override our boundaries, we're not just solving a short-term problem. We're&nbsp;<strong>programming everyone around us</strong>&nbsp;with dangerous expectations.</p>
<p>\
But here's the real kicker – and the part that keeps us stuck.</p>
<p>\
Most entrepreneurs aren't actually afraid of setting boundaries. They're afraid of the&nbsp;<strong>identity shift</strong>&nbsp;that comes with it. Because somewhere along the way, we started believing that our&nbsp;<strong>accessibility</strong>&nbsp;was our competitive advantage.</p>
<p>\
I saw this perfectly illustrated when I asked Sarah why she hadn't set office hours with her clients yet. Her answer floored me:</p>
<p>\
<em>"If I'm not always available… then what actually makes me special?"</em></p>
<p>\
And there it was. The raw truth that keeps so many of us chained to our phones, laptops, and endless meetings. We've confused our&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;with our&nbsp;<strong>availability</strong>.</p>
<p>\
But here's what Sarah couldn't see from inside her always-on prison:&nbsp;<strong>Her fear of setting boundaries was actually because of the pressure that had built up from not having them.</strong></p>
<p>\
It's like a pressure valve in a steam engine. The more pressure that builds, the scarier it feels to release it. But that rising fear isn't a reason to keep the pressure contained – it's the very signal that release is necessary.</p>
<p>\
This brings us to a counter-intuitive truth about entrepreneurial boundaries:&nbsp;<strong>The more successful you become, the more essential your boundaries become – and the more resistance you'll feel to setting them.</strong></p>
<h2 id="thehiddencostsofweakboundaries">The Hidden Costs of Weak Boundaries</h2>
<p>Let me tell you about Mark, another founder in our mastermind group. He did $2.4M in revenue last year, and by traditional metrics, his business was thriving.</p>
<p>\
But when we actually ran the numbers, we discovered something shocking: his&nbsp;<strong>lack of boundaries was costing him nearly $400,000 a year</strong>.</p>
<p>\
Here's how it broke down:</p>
<p>\
<strong>Lost Innovation Time</strong>&nbsp;Every time Mark got interrupted by a non-urgent client message, it took him an average of 23 minutes to get back into deep work mode. With 15 interruptions per day, he was losing&nbsp;<em>4.5 hours of high-value work daily</em>.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Decision Fatigue Tax</strong>&nbsp;Being constantly available meant Mark was making critical business decisions in a state of mental exhaustion. We tracked his conversion rates on sales calls and found a&nbsp;<em>32% drop</em>&nbsp;in close rates for meetings scheduled after 3 PM.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Team Multiplication Effect</strong>&nbsp;His lack of boundaries wasn't just affecting him – it was&nbsp;<strong>creating a culture of chaos</strong>. His team was mimicking his always-on behavior, leading to burnout and a turnover rate triple the industry average.</p>
<p>\
But here's what really got my attention: the&nbsp;<strong>invisible costs</strong>&nbsp;that weren't showing up on any balance sheet.</p>
<p>\
Mark's wife hadn't seen him fully present at dinner in months. His innovative thinking – the same creativity that built his business – had dried up. The joy of entrepreneurship had been replaced by a constant hum of anxiety.</p>
<p>\
He was experiencing what I call&nbsp;<strong>Boundary Debt</strong>&nbsp;– and like financial debt, it compounds over time.</p>
<p>\
Think of boundaries like a cell phone battery. Every time you override a boundary, you're not just using today's energy. You're borrowing from tomorrow's capacity. Do it long enough, and you end up in&nbsp;<em>spiritual bankruptcy</em>.</p>
<p>\
The most dangerous part? Unlike financial debt,&nbsp;<strong>boundary debt sneaks up on you</strong>. It masquerades as dedication. It disguises itself as customer service. It hides behind words like "hustle" and "commitment."</p>
<p>\
But make no mistake – it's stealing something precious from you:</p>
<p>\
Your ability to innovate</p>
<p>\
Your capacity to lead</p>
<p>\
Your space to think strategically</p>
<p>\
Your presence with loved ones</p>
<p>\
Your passion for your work</p>
<p>\
I recently asked a room full of successful founders to calculate their "boundary debt." The exercise was simple: multiply the number of hours they spend overriding their boundaries by their highest value work rate.</p>
<p>\
The numbers were staggering. One founder realized she was "investing" $50,000 worth of her time annually in&nbsp;<strong>maintaining relationships that were actually costing her business money</strong>.</p>
<p>\
But here's the real tragedy: most entrepreneurs don't recognize these costs until they've already paid them. They're too busy responding to midnight emails to notice their creative well running dry. Too caught up in being "always available" to realize they're becoming&nbsp;<em>increasingly ineffective</em>.</p>
<h2 id="whyitsharderforentrepreneurs">Why It's Harder for Entrepreneurs</h2>
<p>Last month at a founder dinner, someone asked an interesting question:&nbsp;<em>"Why do successful entrepreneurs struggle more with boundaries than most professionals?"</em></p>
<p>\
The room went quiet. Then the stories started pouring out.</p>
<p>\
A SaaS founder described turning down a client call during his daughter's recital, only to spend the entire performance wondering if he'd just lost a $50,000 contract.</p>
<p>\
A startup CEO admitted to checking Slack during her father's funeral because an investor might be waiting for her response.</p>
<p>\
A creative agency owner confessed to taking client calls from his hospital bed after surgery because he was afraid of appearing&nbsp;<em>"uncommitted."</em></p>
<p>\
These weren't inexperienced founders. These were&nbsp;<strong>seasoned entrepreneurs running multi-million dollar businesses</strong>. So, what makes it so much harder for us?</p>
<p>\
The answer lies in what I call the&nbsp;<strong>Entrepreneur's Boundary Bind</strong>&nbsp;– a unique set of pressures that make traditional boundary-setting advice feel impossible to follow.</p>
<p>\
<strong>First, there's the Identity Merge.</strong>&nbsp;Most entrepreneurs don't just run their businesses – they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;their businesses. When your name is on the door (literally or figuratively), every boundary can feel like you're choosing between your personal needs and your company's success.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Then comes the Opportunity Fear.</strong>&nbsp;In a world where one connection can change everything, saying "no" feels like gambling with your company's future. Every boundary becomes a calculated risk:&nbsp;<em>Is protecting my Sunday afternoon worth potentially missing the next big break?</em></p>
<p>\
<strong>Add to that the Reality of Responsibility.</strong>&nbsp;When you're responsible for payroll, client deliverables, and investor expectations, traditional boundaries can feel like luxury items. One founder put it perfectly:&nbsp;<em>"It's hard to turn off your phone when other people's mortgages depend on you being available."</em></p>
<p>\
But the most insidious challenge? What I call the&nbsp;<strong>Success Trap 2.0</strong>.</p>
<p>\
Here's how it works: Your lack of boundaries helped you succeed in the early days. You really did need to be available 24/7. You actually did have to respond to every message. Your hustle really was your competitive advantage.</p>
<p>\
But now? You're running a different-sized business with the same size boundaries. It's like trying to run a factory with startup rules – it's not just inefficient, it's unsustainable.</p>
<p>\
I saw this clearly with Elena, a founder who scaled her business from zero to $5M in three years. Her superpower in the early days was her instant responsiveness to customer needs. But at $5M, that same superpower was keeping her business stuck.</p>
<p>\
<em>"I know I need to step back,"</em>&nbsp;she told me,&nbsp;<em>"but every time I try, I remember all the deals I won because I was the one who picked up the phone at 9 PM. What if I miss the next big opportunity?"</em></p>
<p>\
This is where most boundary advice falls short. It doesn't account for the unique psychological weight entrepreneurs carry – the way each boundary decision feels like it could be the one that changes everything.</p>
<p>\
It's not just about managing time or learning to say no. It's about reconciling two competing truths:</p>
<p>\
<strong>Truth 1</strong>: Your accessibility was crucial to your early success.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Truth 2</strong>: Your continued accessibility could prevent your next level of growth.</p>
<p>\
This tension creates what psychologists call an "approach-avoidance conflict" – we know we need better boundaries, but the very things that make us successful as entrepreneurs make us resistant to setting them.</p>
<h2 id="thewarningsignswhenweakboundariesbecomecritical">The Warning Signs: When Weak Boundaries Become Critical</h2>
<p>The most dangerous thing about boundary erosion? It happens so gradually that you rarely see it until you're already in the danger zone.</p>
<p>\
Most entrepreneurs don't realize they have boundary issues until they're already experiencing serious consequences. By then, they'd typically been showing warning signs for months. The key is learning to spot them&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;they become critical.</p>
<p>\
Here are the critical indicators that your boundary issues have moved from challenging to&nbsp;<strong>critically compromised</strong>:</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Physical Signals</strong></p>
<p>\
Your body is often the first to wave the red flag. Watch for:</p>
<ul>
<li>That knot in your stomach when your phone buzzes&nbsp;<em>after hours</em></li>
<li>The subtle dread you feel on Sunday nights</li>
<li>The headaches that come with&nbsp;<strong>constant context-switching</strong></li>
<li>The exhaustion that sleep doesn't seem to fix</li>
<li>Increased anxiety around checking messages</li>
<li>Physical tension when thinking about work commitments</li>
</ul>
<p>\
<strong>The Business Markers</strong></p>
<p>\
Your company will show clear symptoms when boundaries are compromised:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-performing team members start leaving for&nbsp;<em>"better work-life balance"</em></li>
<li>Strategic initiatives consistently get pushed back for&nbsp;<strong>urgent</strong>&nbsp;client needs</li>
<li>Innovation slows because you're too busy reacting to create</li>
<li>Growth plateaus because you've become the&nbsp;<strong>bottleneck</strong></li>
<li>Decision-making quality decreases due to constant interruptions</li>
<li>Your role becomes increasingly reactive rather than&nbsp;<em>strategic</em></li>
</ul>
<p>\
<strong>The Relationship Indicators</strong></p>
<p>\
The deterioration of personal relationships is a&nbsp;<strong>critical warning sign</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversations with loved ones become transaction-like and distracted</li>
<li>Social situations feel like potential interruptions to work</li>
<li>Family members stop sharing important news because&nbsp;<em>"you're always busy"</em></li>
<li>Your team hesitates to bring up problems because&nbsp;<em>"you have too much on your plate"</em></li>
<li>Client expectations keep expanding while your energy keeps shrinking</li>
<li>Personal commitments consistently take a backseat to work demands</li>
</ul>
<p>\
<strong>The Resentment Test</strong></p>
<p>\
The most reliable indicator of boundary issues: When someone makes a reasonable request during reasonable business hours, what's your immediate emotional response? If it's&nbsp;<strong>resentment</strong>&nbsp;rather than neutral consideration, your boundaries aren't just weak – they're&nbsp;<em>critically compromised</em>.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Time-Energy Disconnect</strong></p>
<p>\
A particularly subtle warning sign in high-performers: when your calendar says you have time, but your&nbsp;<strong>energy</strong>&nbsp;says you don't. This gap between theoretical availability and actual capacity is often the first crack in the foundation.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Productivity Paradox</strong></p>
<p>\
When boundary issues become critical, a strange thing happens: you're working&nbsp;<strong>more hours</strong>&nbsp;but accomplishing&nbsp;<em>less</em>. Your calendar is full, but strategic work isn't getting done. You're constantly busy but struggling to point to meaningful progress.</p>
<p>\
These warning signs aren't just indicators – they're&nbsp;<strong>invitations</strong>. Each one is an opportunity to recognize that your current system isn't just&nbsp;<em>unsustainable</em>. It's actively undermining the very success you're working so hard to achieve.</p>
<p>\
The key is to view these signs not as failures, but as&nbsp;<strong>data points</strong>. They're valuable feedback telling you exactly where and how your boundary system needs strengthening.</p>
<h2 id="theboundaryresetframework">The Boundary Reset Framework</h2>
<p>Understanding boundary issues is one thing. Actually fixing them is another. Let's break down a systematic approach to resetting your boundaries – one specifically designed for entrepreneurs who need to shift from&nbsp;<strong>always available</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>strategically accessible</strong>.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Start With Your Non-Negotiables</strong></p>
<p>\
Before setting external boundaries, you need to get crystal clear on your internal ones. Start with these four essential questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What work truly moves your business forward?</li>
<li>When are you at your creative and strategic best?</li>
<li>What relationships matter most outside your business?</li>
<li>What activities restore your energy?</li>
</ul>
<p>\
These aren't just self-care questions – they're&nbsp;<em>business strategy</em>. Your ability to serve others is directly proportional to your ability to protect your energy.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Three-Tier Communication System</strong></p>
<p>\
Create what I call your&nbsp;<strong>Accessibility Architecture</strong>. Instead of being equally available to everyone, establish three distinct tiers:</p>
<p>\
<strong>Tier 1: Direct Access</strong>&nbsp;Reserved for true emergencies and top-priority relationships. These select few get your personal number and can reach you outside business hours – but only for genuine emergencies.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Tier 2: Structured Access</strong>&nbsp;Key team members and important clients get scheduled access through proper channels during business</p>
<p>hours. They can book time with you, but it's organized and predictable.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Tier 3: Managed Access</strong>&nbsp;Everything else goes through systems and team members first. This isn't about being unavailable – it's about being available in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Automation Alliance</strong></p>
<p>\
Strong boundaries need strong systems. Technology becomes your strongest ally in maintaining these boundaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use scheduling software with custom availability for different tiers</li>
<li>Set up email filters and auto-responses that set expectations</li>
<li>Create standard operating procedures for common requests</li>
<li>Implement project management tools that reduce the need for constant communication</li>
</ul>
<p>\
The key is gradual integration. Each system should reinforce your boundaries while making it easier for others to respect them.</p>
<p>\
<strong>The Language of Limits</strong></p>
<p>\
Your boundaries are only as effective as your ability to communicate them. Develop what I call&nbsp;<strong>Boundary Scripts</strong>&nbsp;– pre-crafted responses that maintain relationships while protecting your time:</p>
<p>\
<em>"Thank you for reaching out. To ensure I can give your project the attention it deserves, I've set aside dedicated time for client communications between 10am-4pm, Monday through Thursday. I'll respond thoughtfully to your message during those hours."</em></p>
<p>\
Every effective boundary script should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledge the outreach</li>
<li>Explain the boundary in terms of benefits to others</li>
<li>Set clear expectations</li>
<li>Maintain professionalism</li>
</ul>
<p>\
The goal isn't to build walls – it's to create channels that allow energy to flow sustainably in both directions. Well-structured boundaries don't limit growth; they enable it by protecting the space where your best work happens.</p>
<p>\
Remember: Your most valuable work requires protected time and energy. By being strategically inaccessible to the many, you become incredibly valuable to the few who matter most.</p>
<h2 id="yourpermissionslip">Your Permission Slip</h2>
<p>Let me leave you with a story that changed everything for me.</p>
<p>\
Last year, I sat across from one of the most successful founders I know – someone who'd built and sold multiple companies, each bigger</p>
<p>than the last. I asked her what she wished she'd known earlier in her journey.</p>
<p>\
Her answer surprised me.</p>
<p><em>"I wish I'd known that my fear of setting boundaries was actually the clearest sign I needed them."</em></p>
<p>\
She continued:&nbsp;<em>"Every time I felt afraid to set a limit, it was really my inner wisdom screaming that something was out of alignment. The bigger the fear, the more necessary the boundary."</em></p>
<p>\
That's when it hit me – and what I hope you take away from this entire piece:</p>
<p>\
<strong>Your fear of setting boundaries isn't a warning to stay silent. It's your invitation to make a change.</strong></p>
<p>\
Think about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you're afraid to turn off notifications, that's your creativity begging for space to emerge</li>
<li>When you're scared to say no to a client, that's your expertise asking to be valued properly</li>
<li>When you're worried about not being available, that's your leadership ready to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Here's your permission slip:</p>
<p>You have permission to be unavailable sometimes.</p>
<p>You have permission to protect your energy.</p>
<p>You have permission to disappoint people occasionally.</p>
<p>You have permission to put your highest work first.</p>
<p>\
Because here's the truth about entrepreneurial boundaries: They're not just about saying no to others. They're about saying yes to your most important work.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Your Move</strong></p>
<p>\
Don't let this be just another article you read and forget. Take these three steps right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your calendar</li>
<li>Find two hours this week</li>
<li>Title them: "Strategic Business Planning"</li>
</ol>
<p>\
Those two hours are your first boundary. Your first step toward sustainable success. Your declaration that your energy matters as much as your availability.</p>
<p>\
Remember:</p>
<p>\
Your fear of setting that boundary?</p>
<p>\
That's not a warning sign.</p>
<p>\
That's not a stop sign.</p>
<p>\
<strong>That's your starting line.</strong></p>

This means that there won't be any more Dell XPS clamshell ultralight laptops, 2-in-1 laptops, or desktops. Dell is also killing its Latitude, Inspiron, and Precision branding, it announced today. Moving forward, Dell computers will have either just Dell branding, which Dell's announcement today described as "designed for play, school, and work," Dell Pro branding "for professional-grade productivity," or be Dell Pro Max products, which are "designed for maximum performance." Dell will release Dell and Dell Pro-branded displays, accessories, and "services," it said. The Pro Max line will feature laptops and desktop workstations with professional-grade GPU capabilities as well as a new thermal design.
 
Dell claims its mid-tier Pro line emphasizes durability, "withstanding three times as many hinge cycles, drops, and bumps from regular use as competitor devices." The statement is based on "internal analysis of multiple durability tests performed" on the Dell Pro 14 Plus (released today) and HP EliteBook 640 G11 laptops conducted in November. Also based on internal testing conducted in November, Dell claims its Pro PCs boost "airflow by 20 percent, making these Dell's quietest commercial laptops ever." Within each line are base models, Plus models, and Premium models. In a blog post, Kevin Terwilliger, VP and GM of commercial, consumer, and gaming PCs at Dell, explained that Plus models offer "the most scalable performance" and Premium models offer "the ultimate in mobility and design." By those naming conventions, old-time Dell users could roughly equate XPS laptops with new Dell Premium products. [...] Dell will maintain its Alienware line of gaming PCs and peripherals (Dell acquired Alienware in 2006). The changes were made to create more "unified branding" that will make it "easier and faster to find the right PCs, accessories, and services," said Dell in a press release. It also serves to push the company's "AI PCs" onto consumers.
 
Dell notes that it will maintain its Alienware line of gaming PCs and peripherals "that's been service PC gamers for nearly 30 years."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

<p>:::</p>
<h2 id="tostarttellusalittlebitaboutyourself">To start, tell us a little bit about yourself</h2>
<p><strong>I’ve been a professional technologist for multiple decades, but in recent decades I’ve become more of a recovering technologist. I’ve become more fascinated by systems thinking and the gardening approach to the emergent world over the watchmaking approach of engineering a deterministic world that will never stand. Exploring that convergence between extrinsic systems and intrinsic ideas and actions is my primary focus these days.</strong></p>
<h2 id="describethelifehacksyouuseonaregularbasis">Describe the life hack(s) you use on a regular basis</h2>
<p>The idea of life hacks comes from software. In a software context, a hack may be clever, but it’s often a mere quirk of flawed code or a disposable bandage placed upon on open wound. It is neither deep nor systemic, and it betrays a “script kiddie” sense of amateurishness and superficiality. Hacks presume a simple trick that requires no learning, no wisdom, no inner transformation. Like AI, it is getting a quick answer to a problem without ever being bothered to address a faulty system or developing your own mental prowess to learn, know, and grow as a human. Hacks are mindless.</p>
<p>\
What interests me more are “anti-hacks”. There questions matter more than answers. Living the questions even moreso. Meaning-making emerges from these explorations, leading to insights about the self and our relationship with the world around us, the universe, and what our existence provides as opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="whichpartoflifehasittheyhelpedyouwith">Which part of life has it/they helped you with?</h2>
<p>It’s helped break me out of an endless consumption cycle of more-more-more that drives our ceaseless optimization culture for consumerism. It allows my brain to slow down and absorb and be mindful of what I am doing. What my intentions are. And it breaks me from a sense of urgency that wants me to remove things from my vision or thoughts as something that I am no longer aware of, merely vanishing into the background and enabling me to remain oblivious.</p>
<h2 id="wheredidyoufirsthearaboutitthem">Where did you first hear about it/them?</h2>
<p>There isn’t a single origin event. It began exploring a minor in philosophy as an undergraduate engineering student, evolved into an exploration of metaphysics, and added a more global cultural awareness of historical practices such as meditation and mindfulness. It meant making the time for long walks for introspection and to create fertile ground for generating new ideas. And rather than a singular Big Bang event, it too evolved over a long period of time with regular practice. An anti-hack of hearing, as it were.</p>
<h2 id="isthereatimethatstandsouttoyouwhennothavingthiswouldhavenegativelyaffectedyourlife">Is there a time that stands out to you when not having this would have negatively affected your life?</h2>
<p>Being able to silence all my mobile notifications, to observe all the ways in which modern society tries to frack your attention for profit so you see it coming, allows you to witness the rabbit holes you are about to leap into before it’s too late to get out of them.</p>
<p>\
So for a singular time, I would say once I was leading a project of 160 people with multiple interruptions coming my way. Taking a deep breath, pausing, and actively resisting the temptation to get wrapped up in the reactionary chaos around me saved not only my sanity, but it allowed me to make better decisions with a clearer thought process.</p>
<h2 id="whoareyourfavoritemotivationalspeakersonlinelecturersandortinkerers">Who are your favorite motivational speakers, online lecturers, and/or tinkerers?</h2>
<p>From a systems thinking perspective, I’m a big fan of Nora Bateson, Dave Snowden, L.M. Sacasas, even Otto Scharmer.</p>
<h2 id="whichpodcastsbooksandmoviesdoyoulikeandwhy">Which podcasts, books, and movies do you like and why?</h2>
<p>I hate podcasts. While there’s the warmth of the human voice, I would rather use my idle time walking or driving for thinking. That and listening to podcasts feels to much to me like listening to someone else’s voice mail.</p>
<p>\
Books and movies are ok, but I am probably more engaged with shorter form thought pieces in blogs, substacks, etc. I also appreciate more human gatherings and discussions and debates to make the consumption of content more interactive and less passive.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Disney and Fubo to merge live TV streaming services | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fIjV5Xkum4</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 20:57:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Walt Disney said it will merge its Hulu + Live TV business with smaller rival FuboTV in a deal that also potentially clears the way for the launch of its sports-streaming venture with Fox Corp and Warner Bros Discovery.

These theoretical tools, which instantly provide correct yes-or-no answers to specific questions, help researchers understand relationships between different classes of computational problems. 

Oracles have proved particularly valuable in studying quantum computing, leading to breakthroughs like Peter Shor's 1994 quantum algorithm for factoring large numbers. The technique has also helped researchers rule out certain approaches to solving the longstanding P versus NP problem, a central question in computer science.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Today, I want to discuss another issue I encountered while developing this system - managing concurrency issues.</p>
<p>\
To recap, our project automated the procurement processes of companies in the B2B segment. The system supported multiple types of trading procedures that organizers could conduct online using flexible configurations. Participants submitted their bids and offers, and the organizer analyzed them to choose the best option and sign a contract with the winner. This approach not only simplified the procurement process but also significantly increased its efficiency through automation and heightened competition.</p>
<p>\
The project architecture was organized according to DDD principles and included four layers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Client Code</strong> - framework, external API controllers, views</li>
<li><strong>Application Layer</strong> - internal API for working with the domain, organized based on the Command pattern</li>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> - all business logic of the application, isolated from other layers</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> - supporting code ensuring the functionality of the above layers: persistent data storage, queues, integration events</li>
</ol>
<p>\
The primary entity in the system was the trading procedure - <strong>TradeEntity</strong>. The business required us to address the issue of managing concurrent access. This included preventing simple collisions, such as parallel editing of a procedure by different users from the organizer's side, and handling more complex scenarios.</p>
<p>\
For instance, an organizer might change the key conditions of a procedure while a participant was submitting a bid. As a result, the bid might no longer meet the updated conditions, leading to risks of errors and disputes. Another example was multiple participants submitting bids simultaneously. The first bid might change the state of the procedure by extending it, recalculating rankings, or otherwise affecting the subsequent processing of other bids.</p>
<p>\
After discussing various scenarios with the business, I proposed implementing a unified locking mechanism for the trading procedure. This mechanism ensured control over critical actions by both organizers and participants. Whenever a state change occurred, the system checked and acquired a lock to prevent potential conflicts.</p>
<p>\
The technical aspects of implementing the locking mechanism are not part of the business logic of trading procedures. Thus, the first step was to create a simple interface for working with locks at the domain level:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">interface ILockService
{
    public function getLock(name: string, timeout: int): bool

    public function releaseLock(name: string): bool

    public function isUsedLock(name: string): bool
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
I placed the implementation of this interface at the infrastructure level. In this project, the locking mechanism was based on MySQL, but other tools could be used in different projects.</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">final class LockService implements ILockService
{
    public function __construct(private dbConnection: DbConnection) {}

    public function getLock(name: string, timeout: int): bool
    {
        return (bool) this-&gt;dbConnection
            -&gt;query("SELECT GET_LOCK('" . name . "', " . timeout . ")")
            -&gt;fetchFirstFromFirstRow()
    }

    public function releaseLock(name: string): bool
    {
        return (bool) this-&gt;dbConnection
            -&gt;query("SELECT RELEASE_LOCK('" . name . "')")
            -&gt;fetchFirstFromFirstRow()
    }

    public function isUsedLock(name: string): bool
    {
        return (bool) this-&gt;dbConnection
            -&gt;query("SELECT IS_USED_LOCK('" . name . "')")
            -&gt;fetchFirstFromFirstRow()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
For convenient unit testing, a Null implementation of the service was also created:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">final class NullLockService implements ILockService
{
    public function getLock(name: string, timeout: int): bool
    {
        return true
    }

    public function releaseLock(name: string): bool
    {
        return true
    }

    public function isUsedLock(name: string): bool
    {
        return false
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The <code>ILockService</code> interface provides basic methods for managing locks. Next, it was necessary to determine what exactly should be locked and how. This logic relates to business rules, so I created a separate service at the domain level:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">final class TradeLockService
{
    private const LOCK_TIMEOUT = 5

    public function __construct(
        private lockService: ILockService,
        private tradeRepository: ITradeRepository,
    ) {}

    public function lockTrade(tradeId: TradeId): bool
    {
        lockName = this-&gt;getLockName(tradeId)

        if (null === lockName) {
            return true
        }

        return this-&gt;lockService-&gt;getLock(lockName, self::LOCK_TIMEOUT)
    }

    public function releaseTradeLock(tradeId: TradeId): void
    {
        lockName = this-&gt;getLockName(tradeId)

        if (null === lockName) {
            return
        }

        $this-&gt;lockService-&gt;releaseLock(lockName)
    }

    private function getLockName(tradeId: TradeId): ?string
    {
        if (tradeId-&gt;isNull()) {
            return null
        }

        trade = this-&gt;tradeRepository-&gt;findBySpec(new TradeIdSpec(tradeId))
        if (trade-&gt;isNull()) {
            return null
        }

        lockName = 'trade_lock_';
        if (trade instanceof ITradeLotEntity) {
            return lockName . trade-&gt;getContainerId()
        }

        return lockName . trade-&gt;getId()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The <code>TradeLockService</code> applies locks at the procedure level. If the procedure is a lot, the container it belongs to is locked. The lock timeout is 5 seconds.</p>
<p>\
The next step was to integrate this service into the Application layer commands. To avoid duplicating logic, I created a command decorator responsible for lock management:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">final class TradeConcurrencyCommand extends AbstractCommand
{
    public function __construct(
        private tradeId: TradeIdDTO,
        private command: ICommand,
    ) {}

    public function execute(): mixed
    {
        tradeIdMapper = this-&gt;getDIContainer()-&gt;get(ITradeIdMapper::class)
        tradeId = tradeIdMapper-&gt;mapTradeIdDTO(this-&gt;tradeId)

        tradeLockService = this-&gt;getDIContainer()-&gt;make(TradeLockService::class)
        if (! tradeLockService-&gt;lockTrade(tradeId)) {
            throw new ConcurrencyException()
        }

        try {
            result = this-&gt;command-&gt;execute()
            tradeLockService-&gt;releaseTradeLock(tradeId)
            return result
        }
        catch (AbstractAppException exception) {
            tradeLockService-&gt;releaseTradeLock(tradeId)
            throw exception
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
When incorporating it into another command, a static constructor was added, and the regular constructor was marked private:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">final class PublishTradeCommand extends AbstractCommand
{
    private function __construct(
        private userId: int,
        private tradeId: TradeIdDTO,
    ) { }

    public static function get(
        userId: int,
        tradeId: TradeIdDTO,
    ): TradeConcurrencyCommand
    {
        return new TradeConcurrencyCommand(
            tradeId,
            new self(userId, tradeId),
        );
    }


    public function execute(): void
    {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Thus, the <code>TradeConcurrencyCommand</code> checks the possibility of acquiring a lock with a 5-second timeout for each call. In case of failure, a <code>ConcurrencyException</code> is thrown. If the lock is successfully acquired, the provided command is executed, and then the lock is released. This approach became a crucial part of the project architecture, ensuring data reliability and reducing collision risks.</p>
<p>\
This method provided comprehensive locking for various critical actions involving the procedure entity and other related entities. However, it did not always solve the issue of using outdated data during edits.</p>
<p>\
For example, if two users simultaneously edited a trading procedure (User A and User B), they could both load the initial data, make changes to different fields, and then attempt to save. User A might acquire a lock and save their data, and then User B might also successfully acquire a lock and overwrite some of the changes made by User A.</p>
<p>\
To address this issue, entity versioning can be used. When saving changes, the entity's version is incremented. If the version saved in the database does not match the current entity version, the save attempt should fail.</p>
<p>\
At the domain level, the trading procedure entity can include a version:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">abstract class AbstractTradeEntity extends AbstractEntity implements ITradeEntity
{
    protected version: int
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The version is populated when mapping data from the database model to the entity. Users cannot modify the version at the Application Layer level. During repository save operations, the version's validity is checked:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">final class TradePersistentRepository extends AbstractRepository implements ITradeRepository
{
    public function save(trade: ITradeEntity): void
    {
        DbModel = (new TradeMapper())-&gt;mapTradeToDbModel(trade)
        DbModel-&gt;saveWithVersionCheck()
        ...
    }
}

final class TradeDbModel extends DbModel
{
    public function saveWithVersionCheck(): void
    {
        if (this-&gt;getIsNew()) {
            this-&gt;save()
            return
        }

        transactionId = 'save_trade_with_version_check_' . this-&gt;id
        dbConnection = this-&gt;getDbConnection()
        dbConnection-&gt;startTransaction(transactionId)
        version = this-&gt;rawQuery("
            SELECT
                version
            FROM
                %%TABLE_NAME%%
            WHERE
                id = " . this-&gt;id . "
            FOR UPDATE
        ")
        -&gt;fetchFirstFromFirstRow()

        if ((int) version !== this-&gt;data['version']) {
            dbConnection-&gt;commitTransaction(transactionId)
            throw new VersionException()
        }

        this-&gt;data['version']++
        this-&gt;save()
        dbConnection-&gt;commitTransaction(transactionId)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
In this case, I used a MySQL transaction and a SELECT FOR UPDATE query. Such a query locks the table row, preventing simultaneous data modifications by other queries until the current transaction is completed. If the version from the database does not match the entity version, an exception is thrown. On successful save, the version is incremented.</p>
<p>\
This versioning approach should be implemented for all entities requiring safe concurrent editing.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The mechanisms described above are justified if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is actively used by many users simultaneously.</li>
<li>Conflicts due to concurrent access can lead to critical errors or data loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
However, it is important to consider the complexity of implementing and maintaining such solutions. If the system is not highly loaded or concurrency is unlikely, these changes may be excessive.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Race to Launch Next &apos;Hot&apos; Crypto Fund</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f4XmwtyfQ4</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 20:13:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Purveyors of exchange-traded funds are finding ever more creative — and potentially riskier — ways to lure investors into the crypto craze.

With so many options to choose from, it’s easy to get confused about which device to go with. In this comparison, I’ll be discussing the <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> and the <strong>Onn Google TV 4K Streaming Box</strong>, two of the most popular choices.</p>
<p>\
Both offer 4K streaming, but they come with their own unique features. Let me walk you through my experience with these devices, so you can decide which one might be a better fit for you.</p>
<p>\
Here’s the comparison in table format. I will discuss these points in detail later.</p>
<p>| <strong>Feature</strong> | <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> | <strong>Onn Google TV 4K Streaming Box</strong> |
|----|----|----|
| <strong>Design and Build</strong> | Stick design, compact, HDMI   extension cable included; easy to hide | Box design, sturdier build;   connects via HDMI and USB-C power |
| <strong>Operating System</strong> | Fire OS | Google TV |
| <strong>Processor</strong> | 1.8 GHz quad-core | 4-core Cortex-A55 |
| <strong>RAM</strong> | 2 GB | 3 GB |
| <strong>Internal Storage</strong> | 16 GB | 32 GB |
| <strong>Video Quality</strong> | 4K Ultra HD, supports Dolby   Vision, HDR10+, HLG | 4K Ultra HD, supports Dolby   Vision, HDR10, HDR10+ |
| <strong>Audio Quality</strong> | Dolby Atmos | Dolby Atmos |
| <strong>Virtual Assistant</strong> | Alexa | Google Assistant |
| <strong>Voice Control</strong> | Alexa Voice Remote | Google Assistant remote |
| <strong>Remote Control</strong> | Alexa integration, dedicated app   buttons for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Music | Google Assistant integration,   dedicated app buttons for YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+ |
| <strong>App Compatibility</strong> | Supports major streaming apps   (Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Prime Video) | Supports major streaming apps   (Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, YouTube) |

| <strong>Available Ports</strong> | HDMI, Micro-USB | HDMI, USB-C |
| <strong>Price</strong> | Around $79.99 | Around $32.99 |</p>
<h2 id="1designandbuild">1. Design and Build</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/M5pEHjrJ4aN6a0jzngeRJ9tc5pu2-0z033l6.jpeg" alt="" />Let's start with the design. The <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> is, as expected, a stick. It’s super compact, small enough to plug directly into your TV’s HDMI port. I love how easy it is to <strong>hide behind the TV</strong>, out of sight, yet still get full functionality. Plus, if you need a little extra room, it comes with an extension cable. For me, it’s super convenient, and honestly, you can’t beat its <strong>slim design</strong>.</p>
<p>\
Then there’s the <strong>Onn Google TV 4K Streaming Box</strong>. It’s not a stick; <strong>it’s a box</strong>, so it’s a little bulkier. But don’t let that put you off—it feels sturdy and reliable. You’ll need to plug it into your TV’s HDMI port and connect it to a power source, which comes through a USB-C cable. It’s not as sleek and subtle as the Fire TV Stick, but I actually like the solid build of the Onn box.</p>
<h2 id="2performanceandhardware">2. Performance and Hardware</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/M5pEHjrJ4aN6a0jzngeRJ9tc5pu2-3y133cm.jpeg" alt="" />Performance-wise, both of these devices hold up well, but there are some key differences. The <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> comes with a <strong>1.8 GHz quad-core processor</strong>, <strong>2 GB of RAM</strong>, and <strong>16 GB of storage</strong>. This combination handles streaming 4K content without breaking a sweat. Honestly, I’ve used it for hours on end and haven’t run into any lag or buffering. The 16 GB of storage is decent enough, but you can fill it up if you’re downloading a lot of apps or games.</p>
<p>\
The <strong>Onn Google TV 4K</strong>, on the other hand, has a <strong>4-core Cortex-A55 processor</strong>, <strong>3 GB of RAM</strong>, and a whopping <strong>32 GB of storage</strong>. For multitaskers like me who enjoy switching between apps or even downloading media, this extra RAM and storage really make a difference. Plus, it’s great to know you won’t run out of space any time soon, unlike the Fire TV Stick.</p>
<h2 id="3remotecontrolandadditionalfeatures">3. Remote Control and Additional Features</h2>
<p>\
 <img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/M5pEHjrJ4aN6a0jzngeRJ9tc5pu2-so43307.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>\
\
The <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> comes with the <a href="https://firestickhacks.com/amazon-firestick-remote-control-keys-and-shortcuts/">Alexa Voice Remote</a>, which is great. You can control playback, search for content, and even manage smart home devices—all with your voice. It also has dedicated buttons for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Music, which makes accessing your favorite apps even easier.</p>
<p>\
The <strong>Onn Google TV 4K</strong> remote <strong>features Google Assistant</strong>, volume control, and shortcuts for YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, and Paramount+. There is also an added bonus of a USB-A port on the Onn device which is perfect if you want to connect an external storage device or use an Ethernet connection for faster streaming.</p>
<h2 id="4videoandaudioquality">4. Video and Audio Quality</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/M5pEHjrJ4aN6a0jzngeRJ9tc5pu2-vy233r3.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Both devices shine when it comes to video quality, and you’ll get stunning 4K Ultra HD content from both. The <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> supports <strong>Dolby Vision, HDR10+, and HLG,</strong> which makes a huge difference when watching shows and movies that are meant to pop. The colors are vibrant, the contrast is sharp, and it feels like you’re getting every bit of clarity from your TV.</p>
<p>\
The <strong>Onn Google TV 4K</strong> also supports <strong>Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HDR10+</strong>, so you won’t miss out on any of the eye-popping visuals either. In terms of audio, both devices support Dolby Atmos, which makes for an immersive sound experience if you have a surround sound system or compatible speakers. Watching movies or playing games feels more real and cinematic with that extra depth.</p>
<h2 id="5appcompatibilityandstreamingservices">5. App Compatibility and Streaming Services</h2>
<p>When it comes to app compatibility, both devices are solid. The <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> gives you <strong>access to pretty much every major streaming service</strong>, including Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video. What I like about it is how well it <strong>integrates with the Amazon ecosystem</strong>, so if you’re into Alexa or already have other Amazon devices, it’s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>\
The <strong>Onn Google TV 4K</strong> also supports Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and YouTube, so you’ll have all your streaming bases covered. One thing I really like about the Google TV interface is how it brings together everything I watch and <strong>offers <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/tailor-your-recommendations/">tailored recommendations</a></strong>, regardless of the service. I feel like it’s much easier to discover new content, thanks to Google’s search capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="6softwareanduserinterface">6. Software and User Interface</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/M5pEHjrJ4aN6a0jzngeRJ9tc5pu2-yp333pe.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you’re already a fan of Amazon, the <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> runs on <strong>Fire OS</strong>, and it’s built around Amazon’s ecosystem. Personally, I find the interface easy to navigate, and since I use Prime Video regularly, it’s nice that it gets front-and-center attention. However, the downside is that the <strong>recommendations are Amazon-centric</strong>. But if you’re already plugged into Amazon’s world, you’ll find it familiar and easy to use.</p>
<p>\
On the other hand, the <strong>Onn Google TV 4K</strong> runs on Google TV, which I find to be one of the most polished and user-friendly interfaces out there. It <strong>pulls in recommendations from all your services</strong>, which I appreciate. It doesn’t matter if I’ve been watching Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube—Google TV gives me recommendations based on what I’ve been watching across all platforms, which makes it super convenient.</p>
<h2 id="7pricingandvalue">7. Pricing and Value</h2>
<p>Price-wise, the <strong>Fire TV Stick 4K Max</strong> can be a little high at an average price of <strong>$79.99</strong>. Still, for what you get, seamless integration with Amazon services, solid performance, and Alexa voice control is worth the extra money, at least for anyone already using Amazon services.</p>
<p>\
The <strong>Onn Google TV 4K</strong> is cheaper, a little bit, at <strong>$32.99</strong>. For the additional storage alone, not to mention the upgraded RAM and features courtesy of Google Assistant, this is a great value for someone looking for a great 4K streaming device on a budget.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which one is the better option for you? If you’re already immersed in the Amazon ecosystem and value Alexa control, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a solid choice. However, if you’re looking for a more affordable, Google-centric device with better multitasking features, more storage, and a sleek interface, then the Onn Google TV 4K is hard to beat.</p>
<p>\
For me, both devices deliver excellent streaming experiences, so it really depends on what ecosystem you’re more invested in and what features matter most to you. Either way, you’ll be streaming your favorite shows in 4K in no time!</p>

From a report: New computers based on the latest version of its Core Ultra processors will go on sale starting this month, the company said Monday at CES, an annual consumer electronics show. 

Intel was for decades the world's largest chipmaker thanks to its dominance of the computer processor market. Production technology stumbles and slow product introductions have opened the door to both long-time rivals and firms just entering the space. The company's board last month ousted its chief executive officer, citing the need to improve its offerings. 

The new chips, intended for corporate PCs and high-end consumer devices, are aimed at boosting performance in two areas the company considers key selling points: battery life and the ability to run artificial intelligence functions. According to Intel, an HP laptop that uses one of the new processors can run Microsoft's Teams software for as long as 10.5 hours on a single charge. It can go 20.3 hours between charges when the user is running Microsoft's cloud-based 365 suite, Intel added. By comparison, Intel says a Dell device using a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor can last as long as 9.2 hours and 18.5 hours, respectively, under those conditions.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Generative AI is upending traditional UX and all kinds of new and exciting design patterns are emerging. The proliferation of LLMs has transformed the once-annoying <a href="https://hackernoon.com/openais-whisper-paving-the-way-for-the-voice-interface-revolution">voice-based interface</a> into something that’s truly engaging and a bar-raiser for user connection to your app. <a href="https://sophiabits.com/blog/do-you-need-an-llm-for-that">You don’t need an LLM for </a><em><a href="https://sophiabits.com/blog/do-you-need-an-llm-for-that">everything</a></em>, but I <em>do</em> highly recommend them for voice assistants.</p>
<p>\
But even with great AI, audio is still hard. When building audio recording functionality on the frontend, you’ll quickly run into a few common challenges: capturing audio from the user, processing it for server-side use, and integrating that with a backend like GraphQL. In this post I’ll walk you through a simple approach to recording and sending audio for transcription using a combination of JavaScript's&nbsp;<code>MediaRecorder</code>&nbsp;API and OpenAI's Whisper model.</p>
<p>\
The method I’m showing here is not ideal for production-scale applications, but it <em>is</em> the quickest and most effective way to prototype audio features for your next MVP.</p>
<h1 id="somedefinitions">Some definitions</h1>
<p>There are two key objects to understand when recording audio from a browser:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A <strong>MediaStream</strong> represents a stream of media content coming from a device like a microphone, webcam, or remote content coming in over a network cable. It supports all kinds of media content in addition to plain audio, and is used to get real-time access to the underlying media.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>MediaRecorder</strong> is responsible for actually capturing data from a <code>MediaStream</code>. A <code>MediaStream</code> on its own is good enough if all you need to do is transmit or display the media as it arrives, but in order to record media for later use--like sending it off to Whisper--you need to buffer the stream and save it to a file, which is what <code>MediaRecorder</code> does.</p>
<p>\</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding these two objects and how they relate to each other is half the battle.</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="settingupafrontendforaudiorecording">Setting up a frontend for audio recording</h1>
<p>With our knowledge of the browser media APIs, we’re now ready to start writing some code. The first step is to get hold of a <code>MediaStream</code> that’s connected to a device that can record audio:</p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">// Obtain a reference ot a `MediaStream` which supports
// audio capture. Calling this method will cause the
// browser to ask for the user's consent for your app
// to record audio.

let mediaStream: MediaStream;
try {
  // Calling this method will cause the browser to ask for the user's consent to let your app record audio!
  mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: true,
  });
} catch (error) {
  // If the user declines to give consent, an exception is thrown.
  alert('Cannot record without permission!');
  return;
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
With a <code>MediaStream</code> in hand, it’s now possible to construct a <code>MediaRecorder</code> that will buffer the incoming audio content. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-codec">Audio codecs are a bit tricky</a> here as OpenAI are picky about the formats their API will accept. The <code>MediaRecorder</code> class has a static method called <code>isTypeSupported</code> which tells me whether a given MIME type is supported by my user’s browser. Modern browsers should all support WebM which is a pretty good format, but it’s possible to check a few different MIME types and settle on the first one that’s supported by the user’s browser:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">// Find a MIME type supported by the user's browser
const mimeType = ['audio/webm', 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/wav'].find((it) =&gt; MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported(it));
if (!mimeType) {
  alert('Your browser does not support a suitable recording format.');
  return;
}

// Create a `MediaRecorder` that's attached to the `MediaStream` we just obtained.
// Record in the codec we just found.
const recorder = new MediaRecorder(mediaStream, {
  mimeType,
});
</code></pre>
<p>\
The <code>MediaRecorder</code> won’t do anything until it’s told to start recording, and even when it <em>is</em> told to start recording we won’t be able to get anything out of it. Like many other browser APIs, <code>MediaRecorder</code> is event-based. Specifically, it will emit an event called <code>dataavailable</code> whenever it finishes recording a chunk of audio.</p>
<p>\
The audio chunk is sent to the event handler as a <code>Blob</code> instance--a bunch of arbitrary binary data--which cannot be natively sent to a GraphQL backend. Fortunately, it’s possible to convert this data into a more usable format like a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs">data URL</a>.</p>
<p>\
Data URLs are just strings, which means they can <em>easily</em> be sent to a GraphQL backend as an input argument. This is great for prototyping, but bear in mind they’re not the most appropriate solution for a production use case. Converting the binary blob into a data URL expands its size by about 33% which increases the amount of data transferred quite significantly.</p>
<p>\
The general format of a data URL looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>data:[&lt;mediatype&gt;][;base64],&lt;data&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
And here is an excerpt of a webm audio clip I recorded while writing this post:</p>
<pre><code>data:audio/webm;codecs=opus;base64,GkXfo59Ch...
</code></pre>
<p>\
It’s important to note that <strong>data URLs cannot be directly passed to OpenAI for transcription</strong>. After the server receives the data URL, it’s necessary to parse it <em>back</em> to a binary format that OpenAI’s API <em>does</em> recognize. More on that later.</p>
<p>\
Here’s the last bit of frontend code needed:</p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">// This function takes a blob of audio data and turns it to a data URL
function dataUrlFromBlob(
  blob: Blob,
): Promise&lt;string&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onabort = reject;
    reader.onerror = reject;
    reader.onload = () =&gt;
      resolve(reader.result as string);

    reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
  });
}

// Add an event handler to process audio chunks as they come in
recorder.ondataavailable = async (event) =&gt; {
  // We can't send raw binary to our GraphQL server,
  // so we encode the audio as a data URL.
  const dataUrl = await dataUrlFromBlob(event.data);
  await sendAudioToGraphQL({
    input: { dataUrl },
  });
};

// Start recording!
recorder.start();
</code></pre>
<p>\
The <code>MediaRecorder</code>’s <code>start</code> method also takes an optional <code>timeslice</code> parameter. If you don’t provide it--like me--then the <code>MediaRecorder</code> will keep buffering audio until its <code>stop</code> method is called, and then the event handler will receive the <em>entire</em> batch of audio in one go. This isn’t always desirable, so <code>timeslice</code> can be used to tell the <code>MediaRecorder</code> to record in smaller chunks and send them to the <code>dataavailable</code> handler as they come in. A <code>timeslice</code> of <code>2000</code> means the event handler will receive an audio chunk for every 2 seconds of recording--great for if you want to show the user a transcript of what they’re saying in real-time!</p>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="parsingdataurlsonthebackend">Parsing data URLs on the backend</h1>
<p>Of course, the most robust solution to parsing data URLs is to pull in an off-the-shelf library such as <code>data-urls</code>. This isn’t as fun or efficient as rolling your own, however, so we’re going to write our own. Data URLs in general can come in a variety of different formats, but for our purposes they only come in one simple format that’s easy enough to handle.</p>
<p>\
Rolling our own saves a lot of code from the final application. The <code>data-urls</code> library is <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/package/data-urls@5.0.0">~260.1 kB after minification</a>, which is a decent amount of additional heft in a serverless context. Bundle size matters a lot for <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-your-lambda-functions-run-faster-and-cheaper-gp2034jl">cold start time</a>.</p>
<p>\
In fact if your use case is <em>purely</em> to do transcription of the audio and you don’t care about retaining the data for future use, all you <em>really</em> need is the stuff after the <code>base64,</code> separator. OpenAI’s audio APIs are smart enough to automatically infer the content type of any audio data you send—so it’s <em>theoretically</em> possible to completely ignore the media type portion of the data URL.</p>
<p>\
In practice you generally <em>do</em> want to store a copy of the raw data somewhere, which requires knowledge of the content type. Unlike OpenAI, object stores like S3 are generally <em>not</em> intelligent enough to infer the MIME type of your uploaded objects.</p>
<p>\
The code for parsing data URLs looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">import { toFile } from 'openai';
import type { FileLike } from 'openai/uploads';

async function parseAudioDataUrl(
  dataUrl: string,
): Promise&lt;FileLike&gt; {
  const [header, base64String] = dataUrl.split('base64,');

  const mimeType = header.split(':')[1].split(',')[0];
  const buffer = Buffer.from(base64String, 'base64');
  const file = await toFile(buffer, 'audio.webm', {
    type: mimeType,
  });

  return file;
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Note that I’ve passed a hardcoded <code>audio.webm</code> value as the name of my file. Mapping the <code>mimeType</code> to the correct file extension, but it’s unnecessary because OpenAI will infer the type of the file anyway. It’s even possible to skip passing the <code>type</code> option—I’m just doing it so that later on I can access <code>file.type</code> when uploading the audio to S3. The only requirement here is that you parse out the base64 string correctly and load it into a <code>Buffer</code>, and that the name you pass to <code>toFile</code> ends with an extension that the OpenAI client is amenable to.</p>
<p>\
Calling <code>toFile</code> with a file name that’s missing an extension, or has an extension the client doesn’t like will yield the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Invalid file format. Supported formats: ['flac', 'm4a', 'mp3', 'mp4', 'mpeg', 'mpga', 'oga', 'ogg', 'wav', 'webm']
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<h1 id="puttingitalltogether">Putting it all together</h1>
<p>With this helper function in hand, it’s now possible to parse the incoming data URL and transcribe it. Here’s an example <a href="https://pothos-graphql.dev/">Pothos</a> resolver which does exactly that:</p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">builder.mutationField('audioFragmentSubmit', (t) =&gt;
  t.field({
    type: AudioFragment,
    nullable: false,
    args: {
      input: t.arg({
        type: AudioFragmentSubmitInput,
        required: true,
      }),
    },
    resolve: async (_, args, ctx) =&gt; {
      const file = await parseAudioDataUrl(args.input.dataUrl);
      const t = await ctx.openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
        file,
        language: 'en',
        model: 'whisper-1',
      });

      return {
          // ...
          transcript: t.text,
        };
    },
  }),
);
</code></pre>
<p>\
This solution is not appropriate for production environments, but it’ll get you off the ground without needing to spin up any additional infrastructure or dealing with any external resources. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-fast-and-easy-example-showing-how-to-use-aws-nodejs-sdk-v3-for-signed-urls">Uploading audio straight to object storage</a> from the frontend is a much more scalable solution once you’ve shipped and won some customers.</p>

But for simple MVPs—it doesn’t get much easier than this.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DisplayPort 2.1b Arriving This Spring With DP80LL Cables</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/DisplayPort-2.1b-Coming</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 19:12:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In addition to the HDMI Forum announcing the HDMI 2.2 specification for release in the first half of this year, VESA also took to CES 2025 to announce their forthcoming DisplayPort 2.1b standard...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump responds to Trudeau resignation by suggesting Canada merge with U.S.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hv6yji/trump_responds_to_trudeau_resignation_by/</link><author>/u/AlwaysBlaze_</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 19:09:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hv6yji/trump_responds_to_trudeau_resignation_by/"> <img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/_Y4tQUSSMOAJbuF2fdAr3rWMjQY4ho2TPKaOrf6au2c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ba9af04d69d9808b7b23202d78ca3a6a6dd73b6" alt="Trump responds to Trudeau resignation by suggesting Canada merge with U.S. " title="Trump responds to Trudeau resignation by suggesting Canada merge with U.S. " /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlwaysBlaze_"> /u/AlwaysBlaze_ </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-resigns-us-donald-trump-tariffs-1.7423756">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hv6yji/trump_responds_to_trudeau_resignation_by/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>35 Product Management Books You’ll Actually Learn From</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/35-product-management-books-youll-actually-learn-from?source=rss</link><author>James Effarah</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not just about products; you’ll find yourself thinking about <em>how cities are really just beehives for humans.</em></li>
<li>Systems thinking is foundational for tackling big-picture PM challenges.</li>

<p>\
Not a traditional PM book, but this autobiography is basically a masterclass in MVPs, customer obsession, and scalability.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Walmart’s early strategy was <em>“stack it high, sell it cheap”</em>—the MVP before MVPs were cool.</li>
<li>It’s a roadmap for PMs looking to balance scrappiness with vision.</li>

This is your guide to getting products out of the hands of early adopters and into the mainstream.</p>

<h2 id="bottomline">Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Product management isn’t about memorizing frameworks, reading self-congratulatory blogs, or pretending you’ve got it all figured out.</p>
<p>\
It’s about rolling up your sleeves, embracing the chaos, and maybe crying a little into your morning coffee before you get to work (We’ve all been there).</p>
<p>\
This list?</p>
<p>\
It’s not some SEO-fueled nonsense.</p>
<p>\
These books are here to actually help you—whether you’re trying to stop micromanaging your team into oblivion (<em>Multipliers</em>), escape the dreaded “build trap” (plot twist: <em>Radical Product Thinking has a lot to say about escaping “build traps” too</em>), or just figure out why Karen from design still hates your guts (<em>The Culture Code</em>).</p>
<p>\
Here’s the kicker: no book is going to magically make you a great product manager.</p>
<p>\
But these will give you tools—real, practical ones—to cut through the BS, solve actual problems, and maybe even lead your team without looking like a total amateur.</p>
<p>\
So pick a book, get reading, and start building something that doesn’t suck.</p>
<p>\
And if it still sucks, congrats—you’re officially a product manager now.</p>
<p>\
K bye.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Kamala Harris to preside over 2024 election certification, four years after Capitol riot</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zqH_E0YbLM</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 18:53:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris says she will certify the 2024 election as the Electoral College vote count is underway at a joint session of Congress. This comes four years after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to overturn his 2020 loss. She will announce the results and declare Donald Trump as the winner of the presidential election — a formality Trump asked his then-Vice President Mike Pence not to do four years ago.

Beyond structured data, Nithin has mastered SQL Server’s capabilities for handling JSON, XML, and spatial data. From streamlining API integrations with JSON to ensuring efficient querying and indexing of XML and optimizing spatial data with advanced geospatial functions, his technical finesse is both broad and deep. Coupled with his proficiency in Azure services like Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Lake Store, Nithin brings a modern, scalable approach to database management.</p>
<h3 id="tacklingjsonxmlandspatialdata"><strong>Tackling JSON, XML, and Spatial Data</strong></h3>
<p>Working with JSON, XML, and spatial data in SQL Server presents unique challenges, requiring targeted strategies to handle their complexities. JSON, with its flexible but schema-less nature, demands careful handling. Nithin explains, “Extracting and querying nested elements requires specific tools and methods.” To address this, he stores JSON data in NVARCHAR columns and uses functions like JSON<em>VALUE for scalar values, JSON</em>QUERY for nested data, and OPENJSON to convert arrays into relational tables. He also emphasizes validation with ISJSON and non-destructive updates using JSON_MODIFY, ensuring data integrity while improving performance with indexed computed columns.</p>
<p>\
For XML, Nithin leverages its hierarchical nature by using the XML data type for efficient storage and direct manipulation. To extract data, he employs methods such as .value() for scalar values, .query() for fragments, and .nodes() to break down XML into tabular form. He highlights the importance of primary and secondary XML indexes to optimize queries and schema validation through XML Schema Collections to enforce structural integrity. Similarly, spatial data requires specialized approaches, particularly for non-tabular types like GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY. Nithin notes, “Create spatial indexes to enhance the performance of spatial queries,” and uses functions like .STDistance(), .STIntersects(), and .STContains() for tasks involving distance measurements, overlaps, and containment. By integrating spatial data with GIS tools, he ensures precise mapping and visualization, enabling effective analysis for complex geospatial operations.</p>
<h3 id="sqlserversevolutionformoderndata"><strong>SQL server’s Evolution for Modern Data</strong></h3>
<p>SQL Server has evolved significantly to support semi-structured data formats like JSON and XML, offering robust tools that balance flexibility and performance. Nithin highlights the introduction of JSON support in SQL Server 2016 as a major advancement, explaining how functions like JSON<em>VALUE and JSON</em>QUERY simplify data extraction, while OPENJSON converts JSON arrays into relational tables for easier analysis. He adds, “ISJSON validates the structure of JSON data, ensuring its integrity, and JSON_MODIFY allows updates without overwriting the entire object,” making these features invaluable for real-time applications and API integrations.</p>
<p>\
For XML, which has been supported since SQL Server 2005, Nithin leverages its powerful tools for hierarchical data management. The XML data type enables efficient storage and manipulation, while methods such as .value(), .query(), and .nodes() provide granular control over data extraction and transformation. He also emphasizes the importance of schema validation through XML Schema Collections and the use of XML indexes to optimize performance for complex queries on large datasets.

To accelerate queries for vehicle path analysis and toll zone identification, he implemented spatial indexing, ensuring the system could efficiently handle large volumes of real-time vehicle data. Nithin explains how SQL Server’s spatial functions played a critical role: “.STIntersects() and .STDistance() were employed to detect vehicles entering or exiting toll zones,” enabling the system to dynamically monitor vehicle movement.</p>
<p>\
Beyond analysis, Nithin leveraged buffer zones created with the .STBuffer() function to adjust toll areas dynamically based on traffic congestion and peak hours. This level of adaptability ensured precise toll calculations. He shares, “A combination of spatial data and transactional data enabled real-time toll computation based on distance traveled within specified zones,” with GPS feeds providing accurate tracking of vehicle movements. By integrating the system with GIS tools, stakeholders gained valuable visual insights into traffic density and tolling performance, empowering them to make informed decisions about traffic management and pricing adjustments.</p>
<p>\
To further optimize the performance of spatial queries, Nithin relied on best practices, including monitoring index fragmentation and query execution plans. By utilizing GEOMETRY and GEOGRAPHY data types and enhancing efficiency with spatial indexes, he ensured the system maintained high performance even with complex data loads. His innovative approach combined precision and scalability, demonstrating how spatial data can deliver impactful, real-world solutions for industries requiring accurate geospatial analysis and optimization.</p>
<h3 id="breakingbarriersindataintegration"><strong>Breaking Barriers in Data Integration</strong></h3>
<p>Integrating JSON and XML data into systems often brings challenges such as schema mismatches, performance bottlenecks, and compatibility issues. Nithin has successfully tackled these hurdles using a combination of tools and optimization strategies. He highlights the importance of SQL Server’s OPENJSON for transforming JSON data into relational tables and leveraging XML schema validation to enforce structure and ensure data integrity. By optimizing indexes and standardizing data formats, Nithin enabled seamless interoperability and efficient querying across diverse systems. These methods streamlined data exchange processes and resolved the common obstacles that arise when working with semi-structured data formats.</p>
<p>\
In one notable project, Nithin applied OPENJSON to automate the parsing and transformation of large API response datasets into relational tables. This approach replaced manual data mapping, which had been both time-consuming and error-prone. “This automation reduced processing time by 70%, ensuring real-time updates and enhancing system scalability to handle growing data volumes without performance degradation,” he explains. By addressing these challenges head-on, Nithin not only improved system efficiency but also ensured that the solution could scale effortlessly as data demands increased. His work demonstrates how thoughtful integration and optimization of JSON and XML can have a transformative impact on performance and maintainability.</p>

<h3 id="1buildrelationshipsbeforeyouneedthem">1. Build Relationships Before You Need Them</h3>
<p>It’s no good asking for handouts before a relationship has been established. To anticipate your startup’s needs, it is important to nurture early relationships. Make a showing wherever you can, be it at networking events, conferences, or even incidental meetings at a coffee shop.</p>
<h3 id="2researchlikeajournalist">2. Research Like a Journalist</h3>
<p>Before a startup can thrive, the founder will need to know the nature of the market it’s entering. To gain a thorough understanding of potential competitors and the audience for your business, founders should adopt an effective research strategy.</p>
<p>\
Like a journalist, you can accumulate research through multiple sources, including financial websites, analysis tools, and word of mouth.</p>
<h3 id="3wordofmouthisthebestbaselinestrategy">3. Word of Mouth is the Best Baseline Strategy</h3>
<p>Founders shouldn’t underestimate the power of word-of-mouth networking; it’s the strongest go-to-market strategy because it builds trust and credibility through personal recommendations, which people value more than traditional marketing. It’s also cost-effective and scalable, allowing startups to grow their customer base organically while garnering loyalty and social proof.</p>
<p>\
<strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2014/07/17/why-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-the-most-important-social-media/">Forbes</a></strong> has listed historically successful word-of-mouth strategies, highlighting the Kimberly-Clark campaign run by Marina Maher Communications, which earned the business the WOMMY in the influencer category.</p>
<h3 id="4podcastsarethenewbusinessdevelopmentmedium">4. Podcasts Are the New Business Development Medium</h3>
<p>Podcasts are emerging as a scalable method for founders to build relationships. They offer a platform for sharing expertise, engaging with audiences, and connecting with influential guests. A successful podcast opens up opportunities for networking and trust-building. This generates leads through authentic conversations and content that resonates with listeners.</p>
<h3 id="5newsletterscanbeusedforbusinessdevelopment">5. Newsletters Can be Used for Business Development</h3>
<p>Newsletters are a long-standing tool for businesses for a good reason. A newsletter creates value by building long-term relationships and business development. Good newsletters strengthen the relationship between the business and clients by keeping them informed of its goals and growth measures.</p>
<h3 id="6everyonelovesanaudience">6. Everyone Loves an Audience</h3>
<p>When a startup enters the market, it is entering a public stage. Every move it makes has the potential to draw attention from clients and investors. Cultivating an audience does more than just set you apart from the crowd; it can help to establish credibility and trust. Communication strategies should go beyond spreading awareness of your brand.</p>
<p>\
By showing the world who you are and what you believe in as a startup, you can grow an audience of fans and believers.</p>
<h3 id="7positioningyourselfmatters">7. Positioning Yourself Matters</h3>
<p>When entering a market, it is crucial to carve out your own space. A founder should define and communicate a unique value proposition that they bring to the table. Consider what niche you fill in the market, how you intend to fill it, and why you are the optimal choice for this strategy.</p>
<h3 id="8designyourcategory">8. Design Your Category</h3>
<p>When performing preliminary market research, it is easy to find existing categories to emulate. However, instead of trying to compete in existing categories, founders should design and create a novel category they can inhabit.</p>
<p>\
One example of a company breaking out by designing a new category is Salesforce differentiating itself from Siebel in 1999. As detailed in this article by <strong><a href="https://medium.com/craft-ventures/the-one-who-defines-the-category-wins-the-category-245fee85bfbb">Medium</a></strong>, Siebel was a leader in CRM (Customer Relationship Management).</p>
<p>\
By introducing the concept of “Cloud CRM,” Salesforce defined a category it could use to enter the market and stand apart from competitors.</p>
<h3 id="9practicecoldoutreachreligiously">9. Practice Cold Outreach Religiously</h3>
<p>Cold outreach is a core skill for every founder. Sometimes, the strongest and most valuable relationships are formed from the ground level. You never know who might be your next biggest network opportunity, so cold outreach should be performed constantly and consistently.</p>
<p>\
“Practice cold outreach like going to church on Sundays,” Suffiyan Malik asserts. He recommends sending at least twenty emails to the highest-value potential advisors, investors, hires, and customers on a weekly basis.</p>
<h2 id="afoundationforstartupgrowth">A Foundation for Startup Growth</h2>
<p>With these nine lessons from Suffiyan Malik, founders now hold the keys to growing a startup that will hold its own against the competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>\
By building early relationships, performing thorough market research, communicating through word of mouth, podcasts, and newsletters, growing an audience, positioning yourself in the market, defining your own category, and practicing consistent cold outreach, you can develop a robust network that will help carry your business to success.</p>
<p>\
As a guru of communication strategies, Suffiyan Malik has helped thousands of founders build their business dreams. For aspiring entrepreneurs, he has another word of advice: “Technical ability is key, storytelling ability is consequential. Making comms your superpower is the most fundamental muscle you have to build as an entrepreneur.”</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WLTech’s AI Agent Scores Big in $1 Million Challenge</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/wltechs-ai-agent-scores-big-in-$1-million-challenge?source=rss</link><author>WLTech.AI (WebLab Technology)</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 16:55:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>\
Let’s take a moment to think about learning to drive. Any one of us can learn the basic principles of driving from just a few demonstrations, and once we understand concepts like steering, acceleration, and braking, we can apply those skills to any car — from a compact sedan to a large truck. With these skills, we can also quickly adapt to different road conditions, weather, and traffic situations, even if we have never encountered them before. However, current AI will need thousands of hours of training data for each specific vehicle and condition, while AGI would be able to grasp the fundamental principles of driving and apply them broadly.</p>
<p>\
AGI aims to create AI systems that can truly generalize knowledge and skills — learning fundamental principles that can be applied to completely new situations. Driving a car, playing cheese, go, Minecraft, etc. This differs markedly from today’s AI systems, including LLMs, which primarily operate through sophisticated pattern matching across vast training datasets.</p>
<p>\
While modern LLMs can engage in seemingly intelligent conversation and solve complex problems, they fundamentally work by recognizing and recombining patterns they’ve encountered during training. This is more akin to extremely advanced memorization and statistical correlation than true understanding and generalization, as they don’t build genuine causal models or abstract representations of the world. When they do appear to generalize, they’re usually just finding subtle statistical patterns in their training data rather than understanding deeper principles.</p>
<h2 id="whyisarcimportant"><strong>Why is ARC Important?</strong></h2>
<p>ARC addresses a crucial measurement problem in AI research — how do we actually test if an AI system can generalize?</p>
<p>\
Traditional benchmarks typically measure performance on specific tasks with large training datasets, but high scores do not necessarily indicate true generalization ability. An AI might perform well simply by memorizing patterns in the training data rather than developing a genuine understanding.</p>
<p>\
As F. Chollet writes: “To the best of our knowledge, ARC does not appear to be approachable by any existing machine learning technique (including Deep Learning)”.</p>
<p>\
The main difficulties are the following:</p>
<p>– The expected output is not a label or even a set of labels, but a colored grid with sizes up to 30x30 and with up to 10 different colors. Therefore, it falls in the domain of structured prediction.</p>
<p>– The predicted output has to match the expected output exactly. If a single cell is wrong, the task is considered as failed. To compensate for that, three attempts are allowed for each input grid.</p>
<p>– In each task, there are generally between two and four training instances (input grid + output grid), and one or two test instances for which a prediction must be made.</p>
<p>– Each task relies on a distinct transformation from the input grid to the output grid. In particular, no evaluation task can be solved by reusing a transformation learned on the training tasks. Each task is a distinct learning problem, and what ARC evaluates is a broad generalization and few-shot learning.</p>
<p>\
ARC offers a more rigorous test of generalization by presenting each puzzle with only 3–5 samples, few-shot only. This minimal training data means the AI can’t rely on extensive pattern matching — it must extract the underlying principles and apply them to new situations, just as humans do. The puzzles are also deliberately designed to resist shortcut solutions or memorization strategies.</p>
<p>\
What makes ARC particularly valuable is that it provides a quantifiable measure of generalization ability. Rather than debating whether an AI system truly “understands” in some philosophical sense, we can measure concrete performance on these carefully designed reasoning tasks. This gives researchers a clear benchmark for progress toward artificial general intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="approachestosolvingarc"><strong>Approaches to Solving ARC</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>==Brute-Force Approaches==</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The 2020 Kaggle competition revealed one of the first approaches to solving ARC — brute-force search through a space of predefined transformations. The winning solution constructed a domain-specific language (DSL) containing 142 hand-crafted grid operations. By systematically searching through combinations of these operations, it achieved 20% accuracy on private evaluation tasks. Another similar solution using grammatical evolution to guide the transformation search reached 3–7.68% accuracy.</p>
<p>\
While notable for their initial success, these solutions highlighted a key limitation: they relied on an exhaustive search of pre-programmed rules rather than developing any real understanding or ability to generalize. This gap between programmatic search and true intelligence demonstrates why ARC remains a challenging benchmark for measuring generalization capabilities.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>==Minimum Description Length (MDL)==</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The current approach (<a href="https://github.com/sebferre/ARC-MDL/tree/master">https://github.com/sebferre/ARC-MDL/tree/master</a>) is based on a fundamental principle used to discover patterns and build models that best explain data in the most concise way possible. At its core, MDL states that “the best model for some data is the one that compresses the most of the data.”</p>
<p>\
The solution uses a specialized modeling language to describe grid patterns efficiently. This language provides a structured way to represent both input and output grids as combinations of basic elements:</p>
<p>\
At the highest level, each puzzle is represented as a pair and contains two grids:</p>
<p>● An input grid (in)</p>
<p>● An output grid (out)</p>
<p>\
Each grid is defined by three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A size vector (defining height and width)</li>
<li>A background color</li>
<li>A list of layers containing objects</li>
</ol>
<p>\
Objects are positioned shapes, where each shape can be either:</p>
<p>● A single-colored point</p>
<p>● A rectangle with a specified size, color, and mask</p>
<p>\
The mask system is particularly powerful, allowing rectangles to take various forms:</p>
<p>● Full (solid rectangle)</p>
<p>● Border (outline only)</p>
<p>● Checkboard patterns (even or odd)</p>
<p>● Cross patterns (plus or times shape)</p>
<p>● Custom bitmap patterns</p>
<p>\
This language allows the system to describe complex grid patterns compactly. For example, instead of storing a 10x10 grid pixel by pixel (100 values), it might store it as “a black background with a 3x3 red rectangle at position (2,2)” — using far fewer values while capturing the essential structure.</p>
<p>\
When searching for patterns, the system tries to find the most concise description of both input and output grids using this language. Good solutions tend to reuse elements between input and output (like taking a shape from the input and transforming it in the output), which leads to shorter descriptions and better compression.</p>
<p>\
The success of this approach (94/400 training tasks solved) suggests that this language captures many of the key patterns present in ARC puzzles while being constrained enough to avoid overfitting to specific examples.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>==Direct Output Prediction with Basic LLMs==</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across many domains, using them directly to solve ARC presents both opportunities and challenges. The naive approach involves providing the LLM with input-output examples and asking it to predict the answer for new inputs. However, this method has significant limitations. LLMs demonstrate very limited spatial reasoning capabilities in this context and are highly prone to hallucinations when attempting to predict grid transformations.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>==Chain of Thought Enhancement for LLM Problem-Solving==</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This approach builds upon the direct prediction method by first asking the LLM to analyze and describe the patterns it observes in the input-output pairs. While this additional reasoning step yields better results by helping the LLM decompose the problem, it still has the same fundamental limitations. The model continues to exhibit a high rate of hallucinations when attempting to predict final outputs, even after identifying potential patterns. This suggests that adding explicit reasoning steps alone is insufficient to overcome LLM’s spatial reasoning limitations in solving ARC challenges.</p>
<h2 id="aiagentsandtheirroleinagi"><strong>AI Agents and Their Role in AGI</strong></h2>
<p>At <a href="http://WLTech.AI">WLTech.AI</a>, we see the huge role of AI Agents in the pursuit of AGI is of great importance. They’re designed to interact with their settings dynamically, adapt based on what they learn, and learn on their own. Unlike static models trained only once, AI agents can learn from ongoing interactions and adapt to changing circumstances, making them a vital component in the development of AGI.</p>
<p>\
AI agents are the brains of the operation, coordinating a range of techniques that are adapted to the specific demands of a task. Symbolic systems are great at precise, rule-based reasoning, which makes them perfect for tasks that require understanding transformations such as rotations or reflections. Neural networks are great at recognizing patterns and generalizing from data, which is really useful for identifying the underlying structures in ARC tasks.</p>
<p>\
However, ARC’s challenges don’t end with symbolic manipulation or pattern recognition. Many tasks require a more advanced level of abstraction, including the ability to create new rules, make connections, and adapt to new situations. Language models are useful here, as they can be used for things like program synthesis and abstract reasoning. Search algorithms are another tool in the box as they can explore possible transformations efficiently to identify solutions. Planning systems, on the other hand, provide the framework to break down and tackle complex problems one step at a time.</p>
<p>\
What makes AI agents so clever is that they can bring all these different approaches together. They don’t just use one method at a time. They evaluate and deploy the best combination of techniques to address each unique problem. This ability to adapt on the fly is what sets humans apart and is an important part of advancing AGI.</p>
<p>At their core, AI agents are basically intelligent coordinators. They keep a running record of what works and what doesn’t, so that they can learn from past experiences.</p>

Our Agentic AI solution You can find our solution here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-rQoqrGRGQE6M8bMpfzqf6tV3TnUi-Mp?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-rQoqrGRGQE6M8bMpfzqf6tV3TnUi-Mp?usp=sharing</a> or on Github: <a href="https://github.com/weblab-technology/arc-challenge-2024-10">https://github.com/weblab-technology/arc-challenge-2024-10</a></p>

<p>\
Our breakthrough came from mimicking human problem-solving behavior: analyzing examples, hypothesizing rules, testing, and refining. Instead of brute force, our AI focuses on writing generation functions — Python code that defines transformations — and immediately testing them on the training data.</p>
<h3 id="keysteps"><strong>Key Steps:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>==Analyze Patterns:== The AI identifies relationships in input-output pairs.</li>
<li>==Generate Function:== It writes a transform(input): output function based on observed patterns.</li>
<li>==Immediate Testing:== The function is tested on the training inputs. If outputs match exactly, the solution is assumed valid and applied to test inputs.</li>
<li>==Iterate:== If tests fail, the function is refined and re-tested.</li>
</ol>
<p>\
A surprising discovery in our approach was that iterative improvements often hinder progress rather than helping. If the initial assumption behind a generation function is flawed, attempting to refine it typically amplifies the error instead of correcting it. This realization fundamentally reshaped our methodology.</p>
<h2 id="freshideasoverrefinement"><strong>Fresh Ideas Over Refinement</strong></h2>
<p>Instead of refining incorrect assumptions, we found it more effective to:</p>
<ol>
<li>==Discard the flawed approach entirely.==</li>
<li>==Generate a new hypothesis from scratch based on fresh insights from the training data.==</li>
</ol>
<p>\
This mirrors human behavior of resetting and rethinking when a solution path proves unproductive, rather than patching a broken strategy.</p>
<h2 id="whygeneticalgorithmsdidntwork"><strong>Why Genetic Algorithms Didn’t Work</strong></h2>
<p>This insight also explains why genetic algorithms failed to improve results. By design, genetic algorithms evolve solutions incrementally, refining them over generations. However, when the foundational assumptions are wrong, incremental changes lead to convoluted solutions that stray further from the correct transformation.</p>
<p>\
<strong>LLM Evaluation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet Outperforms Competitors</strong></p>
<p>To tackle the ARC challenge, we extensively tested multiple large language models (LLMs) to assist in writing generation functions. Among them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet emerged as the most capable, significantly outperforming its competitors.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs. GPT-4o:</strong></p>
<p>● ==Performance:== Claude 3.5 Sonnet identified more patterns than GPT-4o, achieving nearly double the accuracy in pattern recognition.</p>
<p>● ==Efficiency:== Claude achieved the same results as OpenAI’s GPT-4o in 1/7 of the execution time, making it not only more effective but also faster.</p>
<p>\
<strong>GPT-4o’s Decline:</strong></p>
<p>● We observed a noticeable decline in GPT-4o’s performance over time. The initial version of GPT-4o was far more capable for ARC tasks than subsequent versions, indicating a potential shift in its optimization that hindered pattern recognition and reasoning for this challenge.</p>
<p>\
<strong>Why Claude 3.5 Sonnet Stands Out</strong></p>
<p>\
Claude’s edge lies in its ability to generalize and identify subtle transformations, which is crucial for ARC’s few-shot nature. Its consistent performance and efficiency made it the clear choice for integrating into our AI agent framework, setting a new standard for LLM-driven reasoning in structured problem-solving.</p>
<h2 id="results"><strong>Results</strong></h2>
<p>Our approach ==achieved close to 30% accuracy on the ARC evaluation set==, significantly outperforming baseline methods. This result highlights the strength of mimicking human problem-solving behavior, leveraging fresh hypotheses over iterative refinements, and utilizing the most capable LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet. While there is still substantial room for improvement, this milestone demonstrates meaningful progress in addressing ARC’s challenges and advancing toward broader generalization in AI.</p>
<h2 id="futuredirectionsforarc"><strong>Future Directions for ARC</strong></h2>
<p>At <a href="http://WLTech.AI">WLTech.AI</a> we believe the future of solving ARC lies in the continued growth of LLM capabilities combined with higher-level reasoning frameworks like Minimum Description Length (MDL) or similar approaches for concise pattern explanation. These advancements could enable models to better abstract and generalize transformations. Additionally, integrating a self-refining prompt system based on a growing solutions bank would allow models to iteratively improve their reasoning and draw from past successes, creating a more adaptive and efficient problem-solving pipeline. This synergy between advanced LLMs, structured explanations, and adaptive learning holds the potential to unlock new milestones in ARC and AGI development.</p>
<h2 id="notablearcsolvers"><strong>Notable ARC Solvers</strong></h2>
<p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark has been key to testing how well AI can apply general rules and think in a more abstract way. Over the years, we’ve seen a number of standout solvers come along, each adding something different to the field.</p>
<p>\
● Ryan Greenblatt’s Approach</p>
<p>In 2024, Ryan Greenblatt, an engineer at Redwood Research, reached a major milestone by scoring 42% on the ARC-AGI public evaluation set, with a verification score of 43%. His approach involved using GPT-4o to generate and refine several Python programs and selecting the best ones for submission. This shows how we can use large language models with program synthesis to tackle complex reasoning tasks.</p>
<p>\
● Icecuber 2020</p>
<p>The “icecuber 2020” solution, a previous competition winner, got a public evaluation score of 39% and a verification score of 17%. While we don’t have all the details about the methodology, this solution has been really important in setting the bar for subsequent ARC solvers.</p>
<h2 id="arcprize2024leaderboard"><strong>ARC Prize 2024 Leaderboard</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/introducing-arc-agi-public-leaderboard?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ARC Prize 2024 leaderboard</a> features the following <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/leaderboard">top performers</a>:</p>
<p>\
● MindsAI are in the lead with a score of 55.5%.</p>
<p>● The ARChitects are close behind with a score of 53.5%.</p>
<p>● Guillermo Barbadillo in third with a score of 40%.</p>
<p>● Alijs in fourth, also at 40%.</p>
<p>● TuMinhDang fifth with a score of 38%.</p>
<p>\
These scores show how everyone’s working hard and coming up with new ways to tackle the ARC benchmark. They also show how different teams are using different strategies.</p>
<h2 id="theroleofarcininspiringairesearchers"><strong>The Role of ARC in Inspiring AI Researchers</strong></h2>
<p>The ARC benchmark is still a great way to test how well AI systems can reason and generalize. Even though there have been some great advances, no model has got to grips with ARC completely, demonstrating how tricky it is to achieve artificial general intelligence. Researchers and practitioners are always looking for ways to combine different approaches, using symbolic reasoning with neural networks, to get closer to solving problems.</p>
<p>\
Benchmarks like ARC give us a sneak peek into what the future holds for AI research. They’re moving the field toward systems that can think and adapt like humans. While we’re still making slow progress, ARC has already set out a clear path to achieving AGI.</p>
<p>\
● ==The focus is moving towards generalization.== (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07141?utm_source=chatgpt.com">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07141?utm_source=chatgpt.com</a>)</p>
<p>In the future, AI systems will be designed to generalize rather than specialize. As the ARC tasks show, being able to solve new problems without having to retrain is a key sign of true intelligence. It seems likely that researchers will develop models that are great at few-shot or zero-shot learning, taking inspiration from how our brains work.</p>
<p>\
● ==Hybrid models are going to be the norm.==</p>
<p>The success of ARC solvers has already shown us that single-approach systems have their limits. The future of AI is going to be hybrid models that integrate neural networks, symbolic systems, and probabilistic reasoning. These models will do well on ARC, but they’ll also be able to handle real-world problems where flexibility and adaptability are key.</p>
<p>\
● ==There’s a new focus on cognitive architecture.==</p>
<p>ARC has got people thinking about cognitive architectures that copy the human brain’s ability to combine different ways of reasoning. We’ll see more research into working memory, meta-learning, and multi-agent systems, which will help pave the way for AI that can reason, learn, and adapt on the fly.</p>
<p>\
As AI systems get smarter, they’ll start working with us rather than just doing our jobs for us. Benchmarks like ARC are helping to develop AI systems that work alongside humans, offering insights and solutions in complex areas like scientific discovery and creative problem-solving.</p>
<p>\
Competitions like these have really inspired the AI community. With a reward of over $1,000,000, the ARC Prize is a great incentive for researchers to come up with open-source solutions that can beat the current benchmarks.</p>
<p>\
At <a href="http://WLTech.AI">WLTech.AI</a>, we recognize that the value of such solutions far exceeds $1,000,000, and we are excited to participate in the challenge again next year to continue advancing the field.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HDMI 2.2 Debuts, With an &apos;Ultra96&apos; Cable For Tomorrow&apos;s Displays</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/01/06/1653246/hdmi-22-debuts-with-an-ultra96-cable-for-tomorrows-displays?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 16:53:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The HDMI Forum has announced HDMI 2.2, doubling data bandwidth to 96Gbps through new "Ultra96" cables while maintaining compatibility with existing connectors.

However, does popularity equate to being the most advanced or beloved language? It lacks certain constructs that are considered integral parts of other languages, such as an extensive standard library, immutability, and macros. But there is one detail that, in my opinion, doesn't receive enough attention - generators.</p>
<p>\
In this article, I want to explain possible use cases for iterators and generators and how they improve the verbosity of one's code. I hope that after reading this article, the following piece of code will make all sense:</p>
<p>```javascript 
while (true) {
    const data = yield getNextChunk();
    const processed = processData(data);
    try {
        yield sendProcessedData(processed);
        showOkResult();
    } catch (err) {
        showError();
    }
}</p>
<pre><code>\
This is the first part of a series: Iterators and Generators.

## Iterators

So, an iterator is an interface that provides sequential access to data.

\
As you can see, the definition doesn't mention anything about data structures or memory. Indeed, a sequence of null values can be represented as an iterator without occupying any memory space.

\
Let's have a few examples:

\
Array is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think about iterators. It's a data structure that stores a sequence of values in memory. It's also an iterator because it provides sequential access to its elements.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (const item of arr) {
    console.log(item);
}</p>
<pre><code>\
The same goes for strings. They are stored in memory as a sequence of characters and provide sequential access to them.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
const str = 'abc';
for (const char of str) {
    console.log(char);
}</p>
<pre><code>\
Let's look at the following function example:
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
const fn = () =&gt; Math.random();</p>
<pre><code>\
This function can be considered an iterator because it provides sequential access to random numbers.

\
Okay, why do we need iterators at all if arrays, one of the language's basic data structures, allow us to work with data both sequentially and in arbitrary order?

\
Let's imagine that we need an iterator that implements a sequence of natural numbers, Fibonacci numbers, or any other infinite sequence. It would be difficult to store an infinite sequence in an array. We would need a mechanism for gradually populating the array with data and removing old data to prevent filling up the entire memory of the process. This unnecessary complexity adds extra implementation and maintenance overhead, whereas a solution without an array can be achieved in just a few lines of code:

\
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
const getNaturalRow = () =&gt; {
    let current = 0;
    return () =&gt; ++current;
};</p>
<pre><code>\
Iterators can also be used to represent data retrieved from an external channel, such as a WebSocket.

\
In JavaScript, any object that has a next() method, which returns a structure with value (the current iterator value) and done (a flag indicating the end of the sequence), is considered an iterator. This convention is described in the [ECMAScript language standard](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/control-abstraction-objects.html#sec-iteration). Such an object implements the Iterator interface. Let's rewrite the previous example in this format:

\
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
const getNaturalRow = () =&gt; {
    let current = 0;
    return {
        next: () =&gt; ({ value: ++current, done: false }),
    };
};</p>
<pre><code>\
In JavaScript, there is also the **Iterable** interface. It represents an object that has an `@@iterator` method (accessible via `Symbol.iterator` constant) that returns an iterator. Objects that implement this interface can be iterated using the `for..of` loop. Let's rewrite our example once again, this time as an Iterable implementation:

\
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
const naturalRowIterator = {
    [Symbol.iterator]: () =&gt; ({
        <em>current: 0,
        next() { return {
            value: ++this.</em>current,
            done: this._current &gt; 3,
       }},
   }),
}</p>
<p>for (num of naturalRowIterator) {
    console.log(num);
}
// output: 1, 2, 3</p>
<pre><code>\
As you can see, we had to make flag "done" to change at some point, otherwise the loop would be infinite.

## Generators

The next stage in the evolution of iterators was the introduction of generators. They provide syntactic sugar that allows values of an iterator to be returned as if they were the result of a function. A generator is a function declared with an asterisk `function*` and returns an iterator. The iterator itself is not explicitly returned; instead, the function yields values of the iterator using the `yield` keyword. When the function completes its execution, the iterator is considered done (subsequent `next` method calls will return `{ done: true, value: undefined }`.

\
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
function* naturalRowGenerator() {
    let current = 1;
    while (current &lt;= 3) {
        yield current;
        current++;
    }
}</p>
<p>for (num of naturalRowGenerator()) {
    console.log(num);
}
// output: 1, 2, 3</p>
<pre><code>\
Even in this simple example, the main nuance of generators is apparent: the code inside a generator function **does not execute synchronously**. The execution of a generator code occurs incrementally as a result of `next` method calls on the corresponding iterator. Let's examine how the generator code executes using the previous example. We will use a special cursor to mark where the execution of the generator is paused.

\
At the moment of calling naturalRowGenerator, an iterator is created.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
function* naturalRowGenerator() {
    ▷let current = 1;
    while (current &lt;= 3) {
        yield current;
        current++;
    }
}</p>
<pre><code>\
Next, when we call the `next` method three times, or in our case, iterate through the loop three times, the cursor is positioned after the yield statement.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
function* naturalRowGenerator() {
    let current = 1;
    while (current &lt;= 3) {
        yield current; ▷
        current++;
    }
}</p>
<pre><code>\
For all subsequent `next` calls, as well as after exiting the loop, the generator completes its execution. The result of subsequent `next` calls will be `{ value: undefined, done: true }`.

## Passing parameters to iterators

Let's imagine that we need to add the functionality to reset the current counter and start counting from the beginning in our iterator of natural numbers.
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
naturalRowIterator.next() // 1
naturalRowIterator.next() // 2
naturalRowIterator.next(true) // 1
naturalRowIterator.next() // 2</p>
<pre><code>\
It's clear, how to handle such a parameter in a custom iterator, but what about generators? It turns out that generators support parameter passing!
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
function* naturalRowGenerator() {
    let current = 1;
    while (true) {
        const reset = yield current;
        if (reset) {
          current = 1;
        } else {
          current++;
        }
    }
}</p>
<pre><code>\
The passed parameter becomes available as the result of the yield operator. Let's try to clarify this using the cursor approach. At the moment of creating the iterator, nothing has changed. Now, let's stop after the first `next` method call:
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
function* naturalRowGenerator() {
    let current = 1;
    while (true) {
        const reset = ▷yield current;
        if (reset) {
          current = 1;
        } else {
          current++;
        }
    }
}</p>
<pre><code>\
The cursor is positioned after returning from the yield operator. With the next `next` call, the value passed into the function will set the value of the `reset` variable. But what happens to the value passed in the very first `next` call? It goes nowhere! If you need to pass an initial value to the generator, you can do so through the generator's arguments. Here's an example:

\
</code></pre>
<p>javascript
function* naturalRowGenerator(start = 1) {
    let current = start;
    while (true) {
        const reset = yield current;
        if (reset) {
          current = start;
        } else {
          current++;
        }
    }
}</p>
<p>const iterator = naturalRowGenerator(10);
iterator.next() // 10
iterator.next() // 11
iterator.next(true) // 10
```</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have explored the concept of iterators and their implementation in JavaScript. Additionally, we have learned about generators, a syntactic construct for conveniently implementing iterators.</p>
<p>\
Although I provided examples in this article with numeric sequences, iterators in JavaScript can solve a wide range of tasks. They can represent any data sequence and even many finite-state machines. In the next article, I would like to discuss how generators can be used to build asynchronous processes (coroutines, goroutines, CSP, etc.).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>emptyDir not working, don&apos;t see any mounts inside the container.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hv3934/emptydir_not_working_dont_see_any_mounts_inside/</link><author>/u/isnehal</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 16:39:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hv3934/emptydir_not_working_dont_see_any_mounts_inside/"> <img src="https://preview.redd.it/xt3sk42yiebe1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cbc34dd47b692f6d3b0ca49107175464fa84a1b" alt="emptyDir not working, don't see any mounts inside the container." title="emptyDir not working, don't see any mounts inside the container." /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/isnehal"> /u/isnehal </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/xt3sk42yiebe1.png">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hv3934/emptydir_not_working_dont_see_any_mounts_inside/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Qualcomm Bringing Snapdragon X Series To Mini PCs For As Little As ~$600 USD</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-X1-Mini-PCs</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 16:33:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following last year's launch of Qualcomm Snapdragon X1 powered laptops, Qualcomm is using CES 2025 this week in Las Vegas for promoting the Snapdragon X Series for mini desktop form factor PCs.

Introduction</h2>
<p>Many times, we need to back up certain claims we make in software development. More often than not, we need to show it very clearly to stakeholders, businesses, and management, the value of our claims. Many times we see a true value in changing some technology, and we see long-term benefits in doing so. Whether the improvements we see are performance-related, code readability, maintainability, or modularity, what actually matters to business are other parameters. These can be anything like fast delivery, feature enabling, image, user experience, profits and business growth. In this way, if we need to make an argument on why we should make a step towards a new technology, we need to be able to justify that. Many times this is not an easy task. We have to clearly identify the business goals and make it clear that our suggestions will make remarkable improvements.For some time I’ve seen talks about reactive programming and my focus has always been WebFlux. RxJava is on the horizon but that will be the subject of another article.In this article, I assume a few things about the readers. Experience and knowledge about MVC and reactive architectures are very important. Therefore the basics are very important. We will go through the implementation of two Spring boot services. One follows a blocking Spring MVC architecture and the other one follows a Spring WebFlux Reactive implementation in MVC. For the purpose of simplifying semantics, I’ll be using MVC to refer to the blocking MVC model and WebFlux to refer to the reactive MVC model. These implementations are all built with Kotlin. The unit tests are implemented with Spock and the language used is Groovy. These languages are very similar to Java and so if you don’t know them, but you do know Java, then you can be very much assured that you can fully understand what’s happening.To keep matters simple, in this article, although we are going to look at some differences between the implementation of a WebFlux application and an MVC application, our tests will only be focused on the artist table. As a follow up to this article I will further explain the rest of the application and further expand the example. For now let’s focus on version 1.0.0.Let’s imagine that we have to present a case in favour of Reactive Programming. We want to suggest migrating our old blocking MVC application to a reactive non-blocking MVC WebFlux application. We explain everything we know about non-blocking applications. We explain the magic of not blocking the main thread. We explain how this will in the end improve performance and how wonderful it will be to be able to process more requests. In our project there are different players and very often, the gap between the engineers and business needs adjustment. This is where benchmarking comes in. What we need to do in these cases is to clearly show business the benefits of changing to WebFlux. Talking about the servlet thread, multithreading, the subscriber pattern, the spawning of different threads per subscriber, vertical scaling, and JVM, can be a good approach. However, most of the time, what we need is to actually be able to point out in the shortest time possible the benefits of doing this. How do we do this? That’s what we are going to see in this article. Just before we continue, please consider the difference between thinking about how many requests we can get per minute and how long a request takes. We will see later on, why is this so important to keep in mind just now.Reactive programming with WebFlux allows us to scale vertically up, from within the VM with small independent threads. Another very important aspect of this kind of application is that its producers don’t overwhelm consumers. In other words, given that it’s all event-driven, the small threads that are created by the publishers will trigger the subscriber when needed. Finally, it’s important to note that with Webflux, our programming style is declarative and not imperative. This means that our code doesn’t get executed in the main thread which normally allows us to debug our code sequentially.</p>
<h2 id="2development">2. Development</h2>
<h3 id="21environmentsetup">2.1. Environment setup</h3>
<p>In order to be able to run this application and perform the benchmarking tests. Aside from the basic setup, we need to have JMeter installed. We will go through that in this article.We will be looking at the implementation of two Spring boot applications. One will be implemented with the old MVC model and the other with a new WebFlux model. This is how it looks after running docker-compose:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu5xxijsckqcypqeisrz5.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 id="22structure">2.2. Structure</h3>
<p>Let’s now have a look at the root modules and folders of the main project we will be looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li>concert-demos-gui — not available for this project yet. This project will be completed in the follow-up article where we will dive deeper into WebFlux and its paradigms.</li>
<li>concert-demos-rest-service-mvc — Our Spring Boot MVC application.</li>
<li>concert-demos-rest-service-webflux — Our WebFlux application.</li>
<li>concerts-demos-data — Data repo where our DTO (Data Transfer Objects) reside. This is where our REST contract is defined and its common for both applications.</li>
<li>docker-psql — The definition and files for our custom Postgres image. Here we will define two databases: concertsdb-mvc and concertsdb-webflux. They are separate in order to make more reliable test results.</li>
<li>jmeter — All JMeter configuration files location. Here we can also find the test results which will allow us to draw conclusions at the end of this article.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="23ermodel">2.3. ER Model</h3>
<p>For this article, I’ve created a concert management tool. The features expected are only at least to be able to save an artist on a database. In this case, we will work with two different databases running on our local PostgreSQL server. One database will serve the MVC (Model View Controller) typical architecture and the other database will serve the WebFlux architecture. The latter is one of the many implementations of a reactive programming architecture. Although both databases serve different services, they will share the same model.Let’s start by examining the ER models of both applications:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fojzbujean68lkddco65v.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, this is a very simple model in which we start out with a concert. Further, we have a number of listings per concert. When doing this, we are saying that our concert will have listings and each listing can be part of many concerts. This is in other words a <code>many to many</code> relation. A concert listing is essentially a set of an artist, a lyric of one music which we should know by heart during the concert, and a complete list of music the artist will play. Music can also be part of different listings and in fact it can also be sung and played by different artists. This is the reason why the relation between the listing and the music is also a <code>many to many</code>.</p>
<h3 id="24springmvcvswebflux">2.4. Spring MVC vs WebFlux</h3>
<p>In my previous article Reactive Programming applied to Legacy Services — A WebFlux example, I explain a few workarounds to make a fully reactive application connected to SOAP services. Although this may have some use to organizations with legacy software, one important step that the article doesn’t have is a reactive data source. Our data source in that article was only a soap service that we, very simply said, wrapped around the Spring WebFlux architecture. In this article, we are going to actually see a completely reactive Web Application using R2DBC.Both architectures can follow an Onion model or a Ports and Adapters architecture. We are going to go through an implementation which uses common rules for both architectures. Also, bear in mind that although the complete applications allow us to save concerts, listings, music and artists, our focus for this article is the Artist table. So we are going to focus on the creation and retrieval of artists for both applications.Perhaps the best way to begin this is just to have a look at the repository layer. Let’s have a look at the MVC implementation (I’m purposely excluding the hashCode and the equals methods because of how long they are. They are also not relevant for this article).</p>
<h3 id="241datamodel">2.4.1 Data Model</h3>
<p>First, let’s look at the artist data model :</p>
<pre><code>@Entity
data class Artist(

        @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        var id: Long? = null,
        val name: String? = null,
        val gender: Gender? = null,
        val careerStart: Long? = null,
        val birthDate: String? = null,
        val birthCity: String? = null,
        val country: String? = null,
        val keywords: String? = null

) {}
</code></pre>
<p>\
In Spring MVC, we have to identify which parameter is the primary key, how the id’s are going to be generated and of course we have to specify that our POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is properly identified by Spring Data JPA(Hibernate inside). This is done by stereotyping our POJO with @Entity and setting up our id annotated with <a href="https://dev.to/id">@id</a> and @GeneratedValue.Let’s compare this implementation with the WebFlux implementation:import org.jesperancinha.concerts.types.Genderimport org.springframework.data.annotation.Id</p>
<pre><code>data class Artist(
        @Id var id: Long? = null,
        val name: String,
        val gender: Gender,
        val careerStart: Long,
        val birthDate: String,
        val birthCity: String,
        val country: String,
        val keywords: String

) {}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The first difference we notice is the absence of the @Entity annotation and we also don’t see any id generation specific annotations. This is just the way R2DBC is currently implemented. In its current state, we will see that many of the annotations we love to use with JPA/Hibernate are just not there. Many reasons can be pointed out to this, but apparently the most important one is that many of the MVC model annotations enter in direct conflict with the Reactive programming principles. We need to make our application as reactive as possible and in this way a couple of important basic things like delegating the id generation to the database native system or not having to specify that our POJO is also an @Entity are important aspects of this. However, probably the most striking difference between the two implementations is how we establish relations between data tables. Next we will have a look at the relation between the Listing and Artist tables. I know I mentioned that the focus of this article was the Artist table only. However, given that this article is also about making a fully reactive application, it is important to understand how we can make ER relations work.</p>
<h3 id="242makingerwork">2.4.2. Making ER work</h3>
<p>Let’s compare two implementations side by side. First, let’s look at the MVC implementation of the table Listing:</p>
<pre><code>@Entity
data class Listing(
        @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
        var id: Long = 0,

        @OneToOne
        val artist: Artist? = null,

        @OneToOne
        val referenceMusic: Music? = null,

        @ManyToMany(cascade = [CascadeType.ALL])
        @JoinTable(
                name = "listing_music",
                joinColumns = [JoinColumn(name = "music_id")],
                inverseJoinColumns = [JoinColumn(name = "listing_id")]
        )
        var musics: MutableSet&lt;Music&gt; = HashSet(),

        @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "listings")
        val concerts: MutableSet&lt;Concert&gt; = HashSet()
) {}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Let’s focus on two important annotations @OneToOne and @ManyToMany. And now the WebFlux version:</p>
<pre><code>data class Listing(
        @Id var id: Long? = null,
        val artistId: Long,
        val referenceMusicId: Long
) {}
</code></pre>
<p>\
This latter implementation looks pretty simple, but we are missing our relations. This is part of the R2JDB architecture concept. If we need to consider relations, then we will have to consider dependencies. Dependent requests increase latency. They also can potentially mean more selects to the database. However, R2JDB does provide interesting ways of making unblocking dependency relationships. It also provides ways of issuing specific database queries, but we will look at these later. For now it’s only important to note that the annotations which define relations like one to many, one to one, <code>many to many</code> and <code>many to one</code> are not available in the reactive R2JDB way. We have to choose between getting this data from JOIN queries, or on the other hand from a complex publisher structurer.</p>
<h3 id="243repository">2.4.3. Repository</h3>
<p>Repositories are in either case very simple and straightforward to implement. Let’s have a look at the MVC case:</p>
<pre><code>interface ArtistRepository : CrudRepository&lt;Artist, Long&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
And now, the R2DBC case:</p>
<pre><code>interface ArtistRepository : ReactiveCrudRepository&lt;Artist, Long&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
We only see a slight difference here in that one repo is a CrudRepository and the other one is a ReactiveCrudRepository. Also notice that they are coming from different packages.</p>
<h3 id="244service">2.4.4. Service</h3>
<p>As before, first a look into the MVC service:</p>
<pre><code>@Service
class ArtistServiceImpl(private val artistRepository: ArtistRepository) : ArtistService {

    override fun getAllArtists(): List&lt;ArtistDto&gt;? {
        return artistRepository.findAll().map { toArtistDto(it) }
    }

    override fun createArtist(artist: ArtistDto): ArtistDto {
        return toArtistDto(artistRepository.save(toArtist(artist)))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
And now the WebFlux case:</p>
<pre><code>@Service
class ArtistServiceImpl(private val artistRepository: ArtistRepository) : ArtistService {

    override fun getAllArtists(): Flux&lt;ArtistDto&gt;? {
        return artistRepository.findAll().map { toArtistDto(it) }
    }

    override fun createArtist(artist: ArtistDto): Mono&lt;ArtistDto&gt; {
        return artistRepository.save(toArtist(artist)).map { toArtistDto(it) }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
For the moment let’s keep in mind that ArtistDto is a class that is being shared between both app implementations. In the WebFlux implementation we see that instead of returning objects or a list of objects, we are returning Flux and Mono. These are known as publishers. In WebFlux, publishers are also called the event handlers. Before diving into this, let’s look at how controllers are implemented.</p>
<h3 id="245controllers">2.4.5. Controllers</h3>
<p>Finally let’s look at the controllers. First, let’s look at the controller implementation for the MVC case:</p>
<pre><code>@RestController
@RequestMapping("/concerts/data/artists")
class ArtistControllerImpl(private val artistService: ArtistService) : ArtistController {

    override fun getAllArtists(): List&lt;ArtistDto&gt;? {
        return artistService.getAllArtists()
    }

    override fun createArtist(@RequestBody artistDto: ArtistDto): ArtistDto {
        return artistService.createArtist(artistDto)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
And the implementation for the WebFlux case:</p>
<pre><code>@RestController
@RequestMapping("/concerts/data/artists")
class ArtistControllerImpl(private val artistService: ArtistService) : ArtistController {

    override fun getAllArtists(): Flux&lt;ArtistDto&gt;? {
        return artistService.getAllArtists()
    }

    override fun createArtist(@RequestBody artistDto: ArtistDto): Mono&lt;ArtistDto&gt; {
        return artistService.createArtist(artistDto)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Given that there is minimal business logic in our service layer, we don’t find anything to be different in our controller implementation. Considering this, we still need to understand how in WebFlux the data is finally sent back to the user. After making a call, the callback method of the controller, sends a publisher back to netty, instead of the plain DTO (Data Transfer Object). We then have netty which subscribes to these publishers and returns the callback data to the user. Our subscribers are Flux and Mono. They get executed after the callback has been made. The point here is to make this process independent of the main thread which normally handles requests in an MVC architecture. It is this difference we are going to explore in this article.</p>
<h3 id="246dtos">2.4.6 Dtos</h3>
<p>Both applications use the same REST contract. The project. For our artist POST and GET endpoints, our REST contract is very simple and it is compatible with messages like the one in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "name": "The singing sparrow Lursi",
  "gender": "FEMALE",
  "careerStart": 1000,
  "birthDate": "a date",
  "birthCity": "The Forrest",
  "country": "The Kingdom Land",
  "keywords": "Rap"
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="31jmeterinanutshell">3.1. JMeter in a nutshell</h3>
<p>JMeter is very easy to use. It’s available on a standalone version and its main purpose is to perform benchmarking tests. Many companies use it and the most interested parties are usually banks and companies which deal with sensitive information. Banks usually deal with an endless number of transactions worldwide. Fintech technologies very easily have to deal with large amounts of data in their AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) systems. Companies that deal with data from sensors need also to be especially sharp when it comes to performance. We JMeter we can very easily make tests out of the box.In our case, we are going to create multiple artists and get them at the same time. In other words, our tests will consist of POST requests and GET requests.Let’s have a look at how we make this happen. Since JMeter is a very easy to use tool, I will just highlight the main points of my JMeter configuration.First, let’s configure the BlazeMeter Concurrency Thread Group (located in Threads (users)/Concurrency Thread Group):</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7w5wlpfngrqdwcbjv990.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>What we are doing here is a process configuration. There will be up to 1000 threads generated for 1 whole minute and they will concurrently use each sampler and make requests to our services. The concurrency will linearly increase up to 1000.Let’s now configure our samplers. You can find them in Sampler/Http Request. They are basically all configured in the same way:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe78928dngzwe62bw0103.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Once the <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> for both MVC and WebFlux are configured (4 samplers), we still have to configure our post requests. Remember that information is being exchanged via JSON formatted messages and JSON is how our REST service contract is defined. We still need to define that in our post requests.For each of our POST samplers lets add Http parameters (find these in Config Element/Http Header Manager):</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhpbgxcmvmfswogf0gxv9.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>In the Body Data tab we’ll fill out the following value:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "name": "The singing sparrow Lursi",
  "gender": "FEMALE",
  "careerStart": 1000,
  "birthDate": "a date",
  "birthCity": "The Forrest",
  "country": "The Kingdom Land",
  "keywords": "Rap"
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Having all our POST and GET requests configured, let’s now add graphical and table representations of our results. Let’s have a look at just two of them for now, because they are the ones we need to understand what we can achieve with WebFlux.Let’s configure the Response Time Graph (find this one in Listeners/Response Time Graph):</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fof1apk15ih137kwrrmfw.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>With this configuration we will be able to see how long the average request takes.Next, we’ll configure the Summary Report (Listeners/Summary Report):</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvxb6lbtydqd2fi7qa44g.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>This listener will give us a lot of summarized information about our requests, but it will also give us the request count. This will be an indication of how much load our services could process.</p>
<h3 id="32runningourtests">3.2. Running our tests</h3>
<p>We are now ready to run our unit tests. We will first run the MVC and the WebFlux tests separately and then we will run them together and see if we can reach any conclusion. For each test let’s make the world a better place and create thousands of <code>The singing sparrow Lursi</code> and see how many we can make and how performant the system actually is.The docker PostgreSQL image is already prepared to run these tests. If we want to run these tests without docker and against another PostgreSQL database we should increase its capacity for 2 important properties:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code>max_connections = 1500
shared_buffers = 512MB
</code></pre>
<p>\
After this we need to restart our PostgresSQL service.</p>
<h3 id="321mvcresults">3.2.1. MVC Results</h3>
<p>Let’s first examine the results of the MVC tests:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flklwkkpgv4zd0l31v3dy.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>At this point we can notice that our post requests were blocked at some point. We also see that some requests were blocked up to 20 ms. It is still a barely acceptable response time, but still acceptable.Let’s see what the summary report says:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code>| Label            | Samples | Average | Min | Max   | Std. Dev. | Error Per | Throughput | Received KB/sec | Sent KB/sec | Avg. Bytes |
|------------------|---------|---------|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| MVC Get Artists  | 1149    | 10235   | 78  | 33906 | 6867.42   | 0.261     | 18.86142   | 12214.32        | 2.52        | 663124.1   |
| MVC Post Artists | 750     | 9812    | 9   | 33294 | 7136.17   | 0.267     | 12.38359   | 4.42            | 4.99        | 365.4      |
| TOTAL            | 1899    | 10068   | 9   | 33906 | 6977.87   | 0.263     | 31.17305   | 12218.71        | 7.48        | 401371.1   |
</code></pre>
<p>\
At this point, we should just take into account that there have been some negligible amount of errors and that we were able to send 1149 GET requests and 750 POST requests in total.</p>
<h3 id="322webfluxresults">3.2.2.. WebFlux Results</h3>
<p>In the case of Webflux we get something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fycoblgj3bm8w7fdjej0o.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>At this point we also see that the load seems to have an effect on increasing latency in response times. However, this is a behavior that is interesting to note and it could be related to PostgreSQL itself or other elements in the pipeline between the request and the response. What is important here to notice in the response times, is that there doesn’t seem to be any difference between the first tests we ran for MVC and the WebFlux tests. One striking difference though is that looking at the graph, at no point were the requests blocked. This is already an achievement in favor of WebFlux. Let’s look at the summary report now:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code>| Label                | Samples | Average | Min | Max   | Std. Dev. | Error Per | Throughput | Received KB/sec | Sent KB/sec | Avg. Bytes |
|----------------------|---------|---------|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| WebFlux GET artists  | 1444    | 8952    | 62  | 20804 | 6164.03   | 6.440     | 23.85830   | 7209.95         | 2.99        | 309451.4   |
| WebFlux Post artists | 1013    | 8254    | 6   | 20088 | 6155.44   | 4.837     | 16.75876   | 7.39            | 6.43        | 451.6      |
| TOTAL                | 2457    | 8664    | 6   | 20804 | 6170.09   | 5.779     | 40.59547   | 7217.33         | 9.41        | 182053.4   |
</code></pre>
<p>\
We were able to send 1444 GET requests and 1013 POST requests in total. Let’s make our results more truthful and remove the error resulting requests. In this sense we have 1444–1444 * 0.0644 = 1351 GET Requests and 1013–1013 * 0.0483 = 964 POST requests. If we compare these results with WebFlux we see that for POST requests and for the same case we gained 1351–1149 = 202 GET requests. And finally we got 964–750 = 214/ This is a great gain. Considering that I ran these tests on a very average laptop (Google Chrome Notebook ASUS C302C). This is already an indication of great things to come in a production environment</p>
<h3 id="323mixedresults">3.2.3. Mixed Results</h3>
<p>\
Now let’s have a look at what could happen when we run both applications in an environment where instead of using separate databases, they are using the same server. In this case I ran these tests with up to 800 concurrent threads to avoid errors.This is our result:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fs0vf5klu58mix731sm3c.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>If we look at our results, we may conclude that the response times of WebFlux are faster. Unfortunately, if we run these tests multiple times we’ll see that performance changes a lot depending on when these tests are run.Since we cannot take a lot of conclusions with this results, let’s have a look at the summary table:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="javascript language-javascript">| Label                | Samples | Average | Min | Max   | Std. Dev. | Error Per | Throughput | Received KB/sec | Sent KB/sec | Avg. Bytes |
|----------------------|---------|---------|-----|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| WebFlux GET artists  | 1818    | 1714    | 7   | 22403 | 2846.73   | 0.000     | 39.69346   | 4512.75         | 5.31        | 116418.6   |
| MVC Get Artists      | 1510    | 3320    | 7   | 16520 | 3516.68   | 0.066     | 33.09589   | 5812.04         | 4.42        | 179826.8   |
| WebFlux Post artists | 1394    | 1425    | 4   | 14886 | 2597.78   | 0.000     | 30.97984   | 10.26           | 12.49       | 339.1      |
| MVC Post Artists     | 1179    | 2813    | 5   | 20344 | 3265.32   | 0.000     | 26.18371   | 8.69            | 10.56       | 340.0      |
| TOTAL                | 5901    | 2276    | 4   | 22403 | 3160.81   | 0.017     | 128.35795  | 10282.47        | 32.26       | 82030.3    |
</code></pre>
<p>\
What we get from this table is the same as in the individual cases. In this case the error percentage is negligible. For the GET requests we get an increase of 1818–1510 = 308. And finally for the POST requests we get an increase of 1394–1179 = 215.</p>
<h2 id="4conclusion">4. Conclusion</h2>
<p>As we have seen through our experiment, determining whether WebFlux is the right option for a potential architectural change, can be difficult to determine. Fortunately we can easily determine the benefits of such a change by measuring performance.In this article we have seen a way to easily build a Reactive application with just one table. We have compared response times and capacity between an MVC architecture and a WebFlux architecture.After measuring the results we couldn’t really defend WebFlux in respect to response times. However, load wise, our WebFlux application was able to process many more requests in one minute.With these results, we no longer need to present our solution in a very technical way. The only thing we need to do is to explain that a reactive application under the same conditions will be able to process many more requests than an MVC application.</p>
<p>\
Let’s go through two examples of running MVC applications:</p>
<hr />
<p>Example 1: A banking application is being used by a class of customers that possesses a high volume bank account. It’s an application not very often used, but it means a lot to the bank. It must perform well and it must be available all the time. The average use is about 500 times a week. Would this be an example to use Reactive Programming?</p>
<h2 id="rreactiveprogrammingisalwaysagreatthingtouseinthiscasehowevertheapplicationisalreadyworkingtherewillprobablybenoperformanceimprovementtherearejustnotenoughrequeststochallengetheblockingmvcarchitectureitsalreadyrunningintherearenobenefitsandjustalotofworktodoitwillbeadelighttodevelopersbutanexpensiveprojecttobusinessthereisnoreasontomakethischangehere">R: Reactive Programming is always a great thing to use. In this case, however, the application is already working. There will probably be no performance improvement. There are just not enough requests to challenge the blocking MVC architecture it’s already running in. There are no benefits and just a lot of work to do. It will be a delight to developers, but an expensive project to business. There is no reason to make this change here.</h2>
<p>Example 2: A company which receives massive amounts of data from sensors placed around buildings, needs to be as fast as possible. There is a high demand for performance. The application it is running needs to provide time-series data in a way that their equipment reacts as fast as possible to data changes. Can this example be an example to migrate to a Reactive programming model?</p>
<h2 id="rcertainlyifweneedtochoosebetweenstayingmvcorgoingmvcreactivethenweshouldgoreactiveinthiscaseasprovenbyourresultsreactiveapplicationscantakeupmuchmoreloadandstayresponsiveformuchlongerthisisavalidconcernforsuchapplicationsprocesseswhichneedtohandlesomuchloadsimultaneously">R: Certainly! If we need to choose between staying MVC or going MVC reactive then we should go reactive in this case. As proven by our results, reactive applications can take up much more load and stay responsive for much longer. This is a valid concern for such applications/processes which need to handle so much load simultaneously.</h2>
<p>In other words, we have seen the three most important pillars of Reactive Applications in action. We have seen that a reactive implementation such as WebFlux can be much more resilient than a blocking MVC architecture implementation. We have seen that in cases of high load, our application was still responsive. We have also seen how the asynchronous nature of WebFlux works in real-time.I have placed all the source code of this application in <a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/concert-demos-root/tree/1.0.0">GitHub</a>I hope that you have enjoyed this article as much as I enjoyed writing it.I’d love to hear your thoughts on it, so please leave your comments below.Thanks in advance for your help, and thank you for reading!</p>

Introduction</h2>
<p>The concept of reactive programming can be traced way back to the mid-60s. It’s a declarative programming model or programming paradigm that is mainly concerned with the handling of asynchronous data streams and the propagation of data through transformations with certain determined orders of execution. The term was invented by Erik Meijer probably around 2010. The history of reactive programming isn’t very clear as to where it started. However, we can see references to it when in old literature we find terms like “data flows”. These ended up being what we for a long time have been used to call and refer to as streams. Data flows as such were a part of another programming paradigm then called dataflow programming. This term was invented by Jack Dennis and his graduate students in the 1960s at MIT. Reactive programming is sometimes referred to as Dataflow programming on steroids. If you’d like to know more about the history of Reactive programming, I placed a lot of links in the resource repo of this article. Please have a look at them at the end of this article.</p>
<h2 id="2reactiveprogrammingingeneral">2. Reactive Programming in General</h2>
<p>Reactive programming has many implementations, and they are all based on the observer pattern. In reactive programming terms, this is also known as the publisher-subscriber pattern. Before the publisher, there is a producer of events. This essentially is the bridge between the triggered event and the publisher. Once a request comes in, the producer triggers the event handler. The publisher is an implementation of that. It processes and emits data without any knowledge of the receiver. The receiver is the entity that knows that data is coming through via a specific channel. It knows the type of data coming in. The receiver is known as the subscriber of that data and it basically waits for the data to be delivered. A subscriber is subscribed to a publisher.</p>
<h2 id="3casestudy">3. Case study</h2>
<h3 id="31notes">3.1. Notes</h3>
<p>In this article, I’m explaining briefly what Reactive Programming looks like and what it is, before making a deep dive into the code. We will not need any major technological background to understand it. I am going to show an example, and we will try to see and identify the Reactive principles as we go along. In this article, I will go through problems found along with implementing reactive programming and the possible solutions. I will describe the pros and cons of each implementation. At the bottom of this tutorial, we will find the most plausible solution I found for the case I’m presenting.</p>
<h3 id="32introduction">3.2. Introduction</h3>
<p>In many current running services across the globe, many companies are still using services from quite a long time ago. Some systems even still use the 8-inch (ca. 20 cm), <code>80Kb</code> disks. For these systems, the software is very outdated, very old, and the implications of changing it grossly outweigh the risks. This usually happens mostly due to economic and workload constraints. Applications for the military, airports, air companies, and banks sometimes are, more often than not, very much outdated. We have seen news of Airports still using Windows 3.11 and banks using <code>COBOL</code>. This is also a reason why software manufacturers are so busy with application transformations and the spread of the 12-factor application philosophy. They are offering other solutions to bring systems up to date to current realities and challenges. Many times this just cannot be done in one step, no matter how inspired we may feel about it.Let’s have a look at bank examples or even telecommunication companies. In my experience with Telecom and Banks, they many times do still work with SOAP services, WSDL service definitions, XSD’s, XLTS’s, and so forth. These are mostly inherited from systems like Siebel and SAP. From a technological perspective SOAP really only has the downside of giving a lot of overhead and package load. For the rest everything is debatable. But this isn’t the problem I want to zoom in. If these SOAP services were efficient, resilient, scalable, responsive, and fast enough, then discussions about them would really just boil down to aesthetics rather than anything else. Truth is that many times their design doesn’t really allow much flexibility and working around them can seriously complicate our development. Not only that, frequently SOAP services are designed with many dependencies in mind, many interdependent keys, different ports and methods, different types with the same name, and many other intricacies also seen in typical REST JSON-based services.In order to avoid any personal relation to any company I’ve worked within in the past, I have decided to make up an unrelated example. Let’s say we have a population where people live in different Shells. We call this our root element. Every shell has a slogan. In my example, there are 16 slogans, and they are all sentences from Cardi B’s rap solo in Maroon 5’s Girls Like You. Shells will have people and will gather costumes. For people, I picked up 16 different characters from Game of Thrones. Each costume has a top and a lower and that refers to the top clothing like a T-shirt and the lower clothing like some trousers. Each person will have a costume and an account with a value. Take note that I am not concerned in this example with validation, repeated data, or circular data. We are going to investigate the complexity of making sub-requests of a request in a Reactive Programming web application.This is a summarized overview of what we are going to look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffum36mlygg3k8xlktx4c.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>\
\
In the above picture, we can see that there is an event loop that handles the events. The events are produced by the REST controller. Afterward, they are handled by the event handler of the publisher. All our SOAP calls and requests are made here. At this point, we have left the servlet thread.One way to see this is that in our built-in application and at this point, we won’t be able to break any execution with any breakpoint outside the programmed consumers or any of the handlers. One way to look at this is by understanding that in a Reactive MVC model, our model is not returning data. Instead, it returns a publisher that later responds back to the subscriber in its own thread and then lets the subscriber reply back to the browser.The event has just been triggered. At that point, our <code>REST</code> controller has already built a publisher (Flux or Mono) and our service is now executing it. Netty is implementing our subscriber to execute the callback to the client via HTTP. We can only have one subscriber per publisher, but we can have many consumers that can be triggered in independent threads via a doOnNext method consumer implementation for example. We can find many other alternatives to doOnNext in the Web-Flux API. A publisher allows us to apply transformations in a similar way that lambdas do. We also have map and flatMap methods for example. This pipeline represents a series of declarative code transformations. We can apply it sequentially to our data. One of the very important things to remember is that nothing really happens until we have a subscriber. This is a very analogous thought to the idea of terminal operations in Java Lambdas. In our example application, we won’t find any explicit subscribers in our code. This is because Netty is our subscriber and its code resides underwater. If you are interested in seeing the code more deeply please investigate three important classes:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reactor.core.publisher.FluxMapFuseable</p></li>
<li><p>org.springframework.http.server.reactive.ChannelSendOperator</p></li>
<li><p>reactor.netty.http.server.HttpTrafficHandler You’ll be able to create a breakpoint in between them and then get a better sense of what’s happening when executing the callback to the browser. In the following example, we can see that the method findLowerById returns a Mono. This is not a value. Instead, it is a publisher that Web-Flux understands and generates a specific independent thread for it to run.</p>
<p>@Repository public class ShellLowerRepositoryImpl implements ShellLowerRepository {</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java language-java">  private final LowersClient lowersClient;

  public ShellLowerRepositoryImpl(LowersClient lowersClient) {
      this.lowersClient = lowersClient;
  }

  public Mono&lt;Lower&gt; findLowerById(final Long id) {
      return Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; lowersClient.getLower(id))
              .subscribeOn(single());
  }

  public Lower findLowerByIdBlock(Long lowerId) {
      return lowersClient.getLower(lowerId);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>\
This concludes my introduction. We will now dig into the code I’ve done and review a few major examples:</p>

Bear in mind that this code is specifically made for tutorial purposes and given its complexity I will only explain the relevant parts to this tutorial.In this article, I’m not showing complete class implementations because of the fair complexity and size of the whole code. The code is in any case, available to see in more detail on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="33datamodel">3.3 Data model</h3>
<p>In order to understand which data we are trying to get, let’s first have a look at our data model:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgjv38adojw9ai60ntz9c.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<h3 id="34makingpublishers">3.4. Making publishers</h3>
<p>Creating publishers rely heavily on declarative programming techniques. Essentially what we are going to do is the implementation of the Observable pattern in several places of our application. In Spring Web-Flux that can be very easily done using Flow and Mono. These are two forms of Publishers. So we are going to declare what do we want to happen with our data once we receive it before our subscriber, Netty, can pick that up.I will guide us through the ShellRepositoryImpl class and another one in our repository layer. These should cover the concepts of using legacy code in a reactive way.All the publishers in our example are being made with code very similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public Mono&lt;Shell&gt; findSeaShellById(final Long id) {
    return Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; shellsClient.getShell(id)).subscribeOn(elastic());
}

public ParallelFlux&lt;Shell&gt; findAllSeaShells() {
    return findAllShellIds()
            .parallel(parallelism)
            .runOn(elastic())
            .map(shellsClient::getShell)
            .runOn(single());
}

public Flux&lt;Long&gt; findAllShellIds() {
    return Mono.fromCallable(shellsClient::getAllShellIds)
            .flux().flatMap(Flux::fromIterable);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Looking at the findAllSeaShells method, we easily can see that the goal of this method is to retrieve all the shells in the repo. In this code, we make use of the shellsClient client. This client communicates with one webservice specifically responsible for the retrieval of SeaShells data. The first method in the lambda chain is the findAllShellIds method. The main highlight of this code above is the Mono.fromCallable. This is the function to use if we intend to call a method from a black-box. We call it black-box, because we know that, further down the line, we retrieve all Ids from an unknown implementation. We just know that we get a list of Ids but we are not interested in how it is implemented. The latter is the job of our legacy code . Our black boxes are our SOAP clients. The SOAP implementation simulates our unknown services and the clients are the adapters we’ve created. In such situations, we won’t be able to completely predict what and how the client responds. From the API we can read precisely how it works. From here we can see that the biggest advantage is that we can program this Mono to return null if it fails: “If the Callable resolves to null, the resulting Mono completes empty.”. Mono publishers are used in representing single objects. <code>Flux</code> publishers are used for lists of objects. The fromCallable method is implemented in the Mono publisher only. It would probably seem better to use the <code>Flux.fromIterable</code> method. However, by allowing a conversion from Mono to <code>Flux</code>, we are letting the <code>WebFlux</code> framework optimize the later execution and conversion from a List object to individual objects to the subscriber. A direct <code>Flux.fromIterable</code> conversion would skip that optimization step. This conversion to <code>Flux</code> is explicitly implemented with a flatMap method. The functions we use are very similar to Java Lambdas. We create them in a declarative way. Essentially we are declaring the chain of events that is going to happen using lambdas. Now that the publisher knows it needs to get a list of IDs, we need to map them to actual shells. At this point, we still preserve a one-to-one relationship. In other words for each Id, we have a shell. Therefore we have it very clear that we need to wait for the Id in order to process our following request. By default, the processing is sequential. We need parallel processing because we want our application to be as reactive and responsive as possible. As a consequence, we need to explicitly define in Flux that we are going to get our shells in a parallel fashion. This is where parallel comes into play. It is configurable with a custom parameter called sea.shell.parallelism. Here we can configure the maximum parallel threads we want to create. For <code>Flux</code> this is still not enough. After this, we need to specify the type of thread management we want and for this, we have different types available. In my example, I am using the elastic type. This is ideal because we are dealing with legacy code which potentially can be very slow. At the same time, in my example, we can have unlimited threads generated per person in shell request. From the API we have this definition: “Optimized for longer executions, an alternative for blocking tasks where the number of active tasks (and threads) can grow indefinitely”. Following this, we will get our Id. Notice that I am still talking in the future tense. We are still declaring code and nothing is happening. With our Id, we will be able to map that stream to another transformation. We will then get our actual Shell. This is our instance coming out of our soap client. Since we are running everything in parallel and it’s a small request can safely determine that our Scheduler is of a single type. From the definition, we have “Optimized for fast Runnable non-blocking executions”. Notice that because of all of the above our <code>Flux</code> is now of a <code>ParallelFlux</code> type.</p>
<p>\
All the other methods presented in this implementation are simple methods implemented in a very Naif way to get the data in a blocking way. Further in this article, we’ll have a look at differences in behavior.</p>
<h3 id="35servicesimplementations">3.5. Services Implementations</h3>
<p>We’ll now look at different examples for our Services implementation. The idea here, to look at four different solutions, which then will be further subdivided into more sub-groups. Essentially we’ll be looking at a really bad solution and we’ll gradually improve to a better one. These implementations comprise the following implementation scenarios:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>traditional MVC approach</li>
<li>mutable solution with loose running subscribers</li>
<li>wrapping a blocking call</li>
<li>awaiting for the loose subscribers</li>
<li>wrapping futures and fork-joins</li>
<li>one by one alternative</li>
<li>mutable solution with coordinated publishers</li>
<li>immutable solution with coordinated publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>\
I have prepared three service types in the module sea-shell-rest-service. SeaShellServiceImpl, SeaShellReactiveOneServiceImpl and SeaShellReactiveServiceImpl. They are all bad, but I think it’s important to delve into this because we’ll see different behaviors we want to avoid. All of them are different implementations of examples we could use to handle our data. The first implements a series of methods using a naif approach to getting our data all at once using futures and fork joins..The second is an example of how we could use a microservice approach, by making the client complete the chain. Finally, the last one is a complete reactive implementation using nothing but chained publishers. These are fundamental examples that will help us understand how Reactive Programming works. We will also gain a clear idea of the problems that we may face in seemingly “obvious and easy” solutions. The last is the example which in the end makes more sense to me to use. It resides in a separate module called sea-shell-service-immutable. I will also explain the reasons why I came to that conclusion.Let’s start by having a look <code>SeaShellServiceImpl</code>:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Value("${sea.shell.parallelism:20}")
private Integer parallelism;

@Value("${sea.shell.delay.ms:100}")
private Integer delay;
</code></pre>
<p>\
As we can see we have two inject properties: parallelism and delay. We already know what parallelism is. In regards to delay, this comes from a property called sea.shell.delay.ms in the application.properties file. We will see in detail what this property is about, but for the time being let’s look at all of the presented solutions. In this class, I’m using the naif word to represent the blocking methods. However, we can look at all of them as naif implementations. Let’s have a look at the methods implementations of this service. I will then guide us through the practical example with the running application. We’ll have a look at what we can learn from these examples.</p>
<h4 id="351example1usingwebmvctraditionalmvcapproachmoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.1. Example 1— Using Web Mvc (traditional MVC approach) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h4>
<p>The blocking MVC approach to this problem doesn’t use any publishers in its implementation. In this method, we’ll basically perform all necessary queries by asking and waiting for the response. This uses the traditional Spring MVC architecture and its purpose in this exercise is to show us how this approach differs from a Reactive Programming approach. Note that I could have used here ForkJoin’s, <code>CompletableFuture</code>’s, <code>Future</code>’s, <code>Executor</code>’s, etc, to trigger parallelism. This is a more complicated option, which doesn’t add anything to a reactive programming way of building applications. It would still force us to wait for all sub-threads to finish before letting go of the main thread. It is represented by methods <code>getAllSeaShellsNaifBlock</code>, <code>getSeaShellNaifBlock</code> and <code>setMainRootElements</code>. These are all imperative programming examples:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public List&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getAllSeaShellsNaifBlock() {
    return shellRepository.findAllSeaShellsBlock()
            .parallelStream()
            .map(SeaShellConverter::toShellDto)
            .peek(this::setMainRootElements)
            .collect(toList());
}

public SeaShellDto getSeaShellNaifBlock(Long id) {
    final SeaShellDto seaShellDto = SeaShellConverter
            .toShellDto(shellRepository
                    .findSeaShellBlockById(id));
    setMainRootElements(seaShellDto);
    return seaShellDto;
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
However further in this article, I will discuss precisely the ForkJoin method and why it’s very unlikely that we would be able to make the method non-blocking in this way.</p>
<h4 id="352example2usingconsumersmutablesolutionwithlooserunningsubscribersmoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.2. Example 2— Using consumers (mutable solution with loose running subscribers) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h4>
<p>Let’s look at <code>getShellById</code> in <code>SeaShellServiceImpl</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public Mono&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getSeaShellById(Long id) {
        return shellRepository.findSeaShellById(id)
                .map(SeaShellConverter::toShellDto)
                .doOnNext(consumerPersons())
                .doOnNext(consumerCostumes());
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
It gets a shell, creates its matching <code>Dto</code> and then tries to change the Dto further using a chain of consumers. If we look inside any of the consumer methods we’ll see an implementation of a subscriber. This subscriber is the last destination of the data being sent through. Notice also that the data type doesn’t change through the doOnNext methods. If we look in detail into the implementation we see that I’m filling up all the chained node tree of a Shell with its Person’s, Costume’s, Account’s, Top’s and Lower’s. Essentially I’m trying to get a complete Shell across and returning a ShellDto. Unfortunately, although the idea behind it seems good, it goes against Reactive Programming principles and it does not guarantee that the objects are returned completely filled with data anyways. It goes against Reactive Programming principles because we are thinking about waiting for the Person and Costumes and all its underlying needed methods to make all their calls and fetch results. This may or may not happen depending on the time the doOnNext is running and the time the Mono is running.</p>
<h3 id="353example3almostreactivewrappingablockingcallmoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.3. Example 3 — Almost reactive (wrapping a blocking call) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h3>
<p>Looking at example 2, you may have had this idea: “Why not make the naif implementation multithreaded and then wrap up that method with a publisher?” Truth is, we could, and in reality, that would indeed be a non-blocking example. We would get all the data in one go, and we would not block the main thread. Unfortunately for this solution, Reactive Programming also means fast, scalable, and more importantly very, very responsive. With this approach, we are still making the user wait, although in a different way, for all the requests to be done. Please look at the solution implemented in <code>getAllSeaShellsReactiveBlock</code>:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public ParallelFlux&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getAllSeaShellsReactiveBlock() {
    return Mono.fromCallable(this::getAllSeaShellsNaifBlock)
            .flux().flatMap(Flux::fromIterable)
            .parallel(parallelism)
            .runOn(elastic());
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
In this example, we moved the problem out of the main thread that waits for the soap call to be done. However, we only re-located it to the single thread in the event loop. Blockhound will confirm that however, it has become a non-blocking method. However, in this way, we are letting the responsibility of dealing with this thread blocking system on ourselves. WebFlux is only responsible to essentially wrap this otherwise blocking method.</p>
<h3 id="354example4awaitingreactiveapproachawaitingfortheloosesubscribersmoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.4. Example 4 — Awaiting reactive approach(awaiting for the loose subscribers) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h3>
<p>Take a look at the differences between getAllSeaShellsReactiveWithDelay and getAllSeaShells. See the delayElements method? From the definition “duration by which to delay each Subscriber.onNext(T) signal”. This means that each one of the signals will be delayed by a certain about of time. By default, we have established 100ms in this delay. We will see that this is enough to get complete data. Furthermore, we will also see how it actually works. Remember that being an upgrade of example 1, this is still not our solution:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public Flux&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getAllSeaShellsReactiveWithDelay() {
    return getAllSeaShells()
            .sequential()
            .delayElements(ofMillis(delay))
            .subscribeOn(elastic());
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Looking at the above code, we can see that basically, we are just guessing the time it will take for the getAllSeaShells() to complete. Further, we are always making sure that for each request, the request will wait for that specific time. In other words, we just made a non-blocking request that takes at least a specific time to return a response.</p>
<h3 id="355example5wrappingandforkjoiningwrappingfuturesandforkjoinsmoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.5. Example 5 — Wrapping and Fork Joining(wrapping futures and fork-joins) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h3>
<p>Up until here, we have made no mention of multithreading. Now we are going to do just that. In this same class let’s have a look at method <code>getSeaShellCostumesForkJoinTask</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public Flux&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getAllSeaShellsReactiveWithForkJoins() {
    return Flux.fromStream(shellRepository.findAllSeaShellsBlock().parallelStream()
            .map(shell -&gt; {
                final ForkJoinPool commonPool = new ForkJoinPool(100);
                final SeaShellDto seaShellDto = SeaShellConverter.toShellDto(shell);
                final Stream&lt;ForkJoinTask&lt;SeaShellPersonDto&gt;&gt; personDtoStream =
                        commonPool.invoke(getSeaShellPersonsForkJoinTask(commonPool, seaShellDto));
                final Stream&lt;ForkJoinTask&lt;SeaShellCostumeDto&gt;&gt;
                        costumeDtoStream = commonPool.invoke(getSeaShellCostumesForkJoinTask(commonPool, seaShellDto));
                seaShellDto.setPersons(personDtoStream.map(ForkJoinTask::join).collect(toList()));
                seaShellDto.setCostumes(costumeDtoStream.map(ForkJoinTask::join).collect(toList()));
                return seaShellDto;
            }));
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
In this method, we are using a from stream method. Notice that there is a ForkJoinPool. If we run the unit tests and see how they are implemented:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Test
public void findAllCompleteSeaShellsReactiveWithForkJoins_onCall_thenBlocking() {
    assertThrows(WebServiceException.class, () -&gt; delay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .doOnNext(it -&gt; seaShellService.getAllSeaShellsReactiveWithForkJoins())
            .block());
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The exception we’re catching here is <code>WebServiceException</code>. This exception is thrown by blockound in the chain when it finds a blocking call. We are using a publisher, the publisher is being used and yet, <code>Blockhound</code> is still saying that we have a blocking method. The only difference between this method and all the other methods is that we are using a <code>ForkJoinPool</code> within the wrapper. In this case, it seems that this happens because of where the ForkJoin pool is created. When a thread joins the commonPool, it will block the main thread. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<h3 id="356example6areactiveclientonebyonealternativemoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.6. Example 6 — A reactive client (one by one alternative) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h3>
<p>One simple way of making everything reactive is to wrap up all your methods with publishers. Not much work is involved in this solution because we are only making sure that we pass the simple publishers we made in our repositories all the way to the controllers. Our services work almost as simple proxies. This means that they do have an extra change added. This is simply the conversion of the data to a <code>Dto</code>. Let’s take a look at an example in the <code>SeaShellReactiveOneServiceImpl</code> class:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public Mono&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getSeaShellById(Long id) {
    return this.shellRepository.findSeaShellById(id)
            .map(SeaShellConverter::toShellDto);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
In this way, you can see that the only change is a map to a ShellDto. This is one of my elected solutions to consider when thinking about creating a reactive framework around legacy services.We can find an example of our reactive client in the future package. This client is implemented in class <code>SeaShellWebReactiveOneClient</code>. There is an implementation with a subscriber. In the end, we wait for 1 second in order to let the subscriber finish its work:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">private void consumeReactively() throws InterruptedException {
    getAllSeaShellsReactively().subscribe(x -&gt; log.info("BLOCK-&gt;" + x.toString()));
    Thread.sleep(1000);
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="357example7afullyreactiveapproachmutablesolutionwithcoordinatedpublishersmoduleseashellrestservice">3.5.7. Example 7 — A fully reactive approach(mutable solution with coordinated publishers) — module sea-shell-rest-service</h3>
<p>In some cases, we may find it more convenient to make sure that we get a few important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>All data at once</li>
<li>Keep it non-blocking</li>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Achieve true parallelism</li>
</ol>
<p>\
Achieving an improvement in all of these points at the same points is highly unlikely. If we get all the data at once, we will reduce performance. If we want to keep it simple, then chaining everything together may work against us. To keep it non-blocking, we may be moving a lot of performance to the single thread that deals with everything. The best way to answer this is: Experience will tell us everything we need to know about these decisions. If after weighing all pro’s and con’s of taking a fully reactive approach, we are still convinced, then let’s look at how this would work.Let’s start with the example on <code>class SeaShellReactiveServiceImpl</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public ParallelFlux&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getAllSeaShells() {
    return shellRepository
            .findAllSeaShells()
            .map(this::fetchSeaShellPublisher).flatMap(Flux::from);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The <code>fetchSeaShellPublisher</code> is a method that returns a publisher that will start our publishing process. Notice that we are mapping a flux of SeaShells coming from our SOAP services. When mapping from a Publisher to another publisher, we will need to flatMap everything. Let’s keep this in mind before we move on. It’s important to understand that we are still only declaring and nothing has actually happened in terms of processing.Let’s have a look at <code>fetchSeaShellPublisher</code> in more detail:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">private Mono&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; fetchSeaShellPublisher(Shell seaShell) {
    final SeaShellDto seaShellDtoReturn = SeaShellConverter.toShellDto(seaShell);

    return zip(
            fetchPersonsPublisher(seaShell, seaShellDtoReturn).subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel()),
            fetchCostumesPublisher(seaShell, seaShellDtoReturn).subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel()),
            (persons, costumes) -&gt; seaShellDtoReturn);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
See that we are using the Mono.zip method. This is one of the many ways to chain publishers together. We are going to have a look at this one in particular. Later I may make a whole article about the improvement of this implementation. What’s important for now is to see the chaining of publishers in action. With the zip method we can chain publishers together and implement its result. A very nice feature of zip is that when we subscribe to the participating publishers on a parallel scheduler, they actually work in parallel. In our data model actually have a lot of pairs. In the root of the shell we have two elements. A list of persons and a list of costumes. At the root of our costumes, we have another pair. A top and a lower. In the root of person, yet another one. An account and a costume. Notice that costume in a person follows the same data model as a person.Let’s look at one of these two methods to see how the chain works. This is <code>fetchPersonsPublisher</code>:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">private Mono&lt;?&gt; fetchPersonsPublisher(Shell seaShell, SeaShellDto seaShellDtoReturn) {
    return from(from(just(
            seaShell.getPersons()).subscribeOn(parallel()).map(shellPersonRepository::findPersonsBlock).subscribeOn(parallel())
            .map(persons -&gt; {
                persons.forEach(person -&gt; seaShellDtoReturn.getPersons().add(SeaShellConverter.toShellPersonDto(person)));
                return seaShellDtoReturn.getPersons();
            }))
            .thenMany(zip(
                    fetchPersonAccountPublisher(seaShellDtoReturn).subscribeOn(parallel()),
                    fetchPersonFullCostumePublisher(seaShellDtoReturn).subscribeOn(parallel()))));
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Take a moment to look at the thenMany method. This method sets up the first element in our person's publisher chain. We know that in a persons element we should pick up an account and a costume at the same time. As we now are aware, this is where the zip method comes in to essentially zip those two publishers together and in parallel as one single publisher! We should be able to easily interpret the rest of the code with this explanation.When all the chains are complete, we can make sure that our thread will run through multiple publishers in a non-blocking way. The returned publisher is a result of this chaining and it will be handled independently in one separate thread without interfering with the main thread. It will of course generate different threads and it will evidently generate parallelism. The difference is that no interference with the main thread will be made.</p>
<h4 id="358example8afullyreactiveapproachimmutablesolutionwithcoordinatedpublishersmoduleseashellserviceimmutable">3.5.8. Example 8— A fully reactive approach(immutable solution with coordinated publishers) — module sea-shell-service-immutable</h4>
<p>\
We finally reach our perfect solution. In the same way, as in the previous example, our goal is to make a fully reactive call. We already achieved that, however, we were not able yet to remove the side-effects of our code purely because we are taking advantage of mutability. With immutability, the whole code needs to change and the paradigm changes once again radically.In this case, the <code>getShellsById</code> method takes a different form:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public Mono&lt;SeaShellDto&gt; getSeaShellById(Long id) {
  return shellImmutableRepository.findSeaShellById(id)
    .flatMap(shell -&gt;
      zip(
        shellPersonImmutableRepository
                .findPersons(shell.getPersons().getPersonId())
                .flatMap(person -&gt; personPublisher(person).subscribeOn(parallel()))
                .sequential().collectList().subscribeOn(parallel()),
        shellCostumeImmutableRepository
                .findCostumes(shell.getCostumes().getCostumeId())
                .flatMap(costume -&gt; costumePublisher(costume).subscribeOn(parallel()))
                .sequential().collectList().subscribeOn(parallel()),
        (persons, costumes) -&gt;
                SeaShellDto.builder()
                        .name(shell.getName())
                        .scientificName(shell.getScientificName())
                        .personIds(shell.getPersons().getPersonId())
                        .costumeIds(shell.getCostumes().getCostumeId())
                        .persons(persons)
                        .costumes(costumes)
                        .build()).subscribeOn(parallel())
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
The method is considerably large, but this is mostly because of the builder we are using. We first find a <code>Shell</code>. Then, with that <code>Shell</code>, we will find all persons and costumes. Each process will run in parallel and upon completion, the resulting two lists will be used to create a new Shell with the results of the previous Shell query. If you follow the way persons and costumes are created in this project, you will see the creation of different objects. With the mutable solution, we only changed the property. With this immutable solution, we need to create a whole new object every time we need an object with a different property. Using common Java POJOS’s we would also be able to create an example like this one, but it helps a lot to have a constraint against the usage of property changes. This is why I chose to use java records for this example, and so, our new <code>Shell</code> POJO takes a new form:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public record SeaShellDto(
        String name,
        String scientificName,
        String slogan,
        List&lt;SeaShellPersonDto&gt; persons,
        List&lt;SeaShellCostumeDto&gt; costumes,
        List&lt;Long&gt; personIds,
        List&lt;Long&gt; costumeIds) {

    @Builder
    public SeaShellDto {
    }
}

<h3 id="36controllers">3.6. Controllers</h3>
<p>Let’s run our SOAP service and our SpringBoot Application to analyze this situation.</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Run the soap service:</p>
<p>cd sea-shell-soap-wiremock/sea-shell-soap-service/target java -jar sea-shell-soap-service-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar</p></li>
</ul>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Run our Spring Boot service:</p>
<p>cd sea-shell-service-spring-web-flux/sea-shell-rest-service/target java -jar sea-shell-rest-service-0.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</p></li>
</ul>
<p>\
Let’s study on more detail our four controllers: <code>SeaShellControllerImpl</code>, <code>SeaShellReactiveControllerImpl</code> and <code>SeaShellReactiveReactiveOneControllerImpl</code>. If we take a look at them, there are quite a few methods implemented. We’ll have a look at the reactions of all of these calls to our service. For every example please take a moment to review the consumer's chapter if you think you’ve missed something. We can use curl for this or our browser. For the purpose of readability and to make a faster assessment of each call I think it’s better to use a browser. I used Chrome and the JSONView plugin for this. In some examples, I need to return objects of different types. Coincidently they are always pairs and that’s why I’m using the Spring Data Pair type to return these objects.Example of <code>ParallelFlux</code>In order to have a clean start, I decided to create an example 0 to show a couple of basic things that happen when making a request to the back end.Let’s look at the getShellSlogans method. Make the following request:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8080/seashells/slogans
</code></pre>
<p>\
In this method, I’m just mapping the results of a non-blocking call defined in method <code>getAllSeaShells</code> to its respective slogan. The reason I’m mapping them and not calling one method to get the slogan directly is so that we can see that, even though we have implemented it with several calls inside and several subscribers defined in the consumers, nothing changes in terms of performance. Now let’s check our logs. We should be able to see all the subtrees of the shells being called. In some cases the values are null, others empty and in other cases, the values are all there. In the following examples, I will explain this further. For the moment, The important part of this example is that our method is returning a <code>ParallelFlux</code>. In this case, the point is to see that we have achieved this and that every Pair we return is not following the actual order of Cardi B’s lyrics:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">[
  {
    first: "Baltic tellin",
    second: "I need you right here 'cause every time you call"
  },
  {
    first: "Baltic tellin",
    second: "I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar"
  },
  ..
]
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<hr />
<p>We may get lucky and we may indeed get the whole lyrics right for the complete 16 slogan segment, but that is highly unlikely. We all know that Cardi B starts her rap with “Not too long ago, I was dancing for dollars (eeoow)”. What this shows is that ParallelFlux does not guarantee the order.</p>
<h4 id="361example1">3.6.1. Example 1</h4>
<p>In our blocking MVC example, we are always sure to return our data completely. It has been implemented in a traditional blocking fashion. Still, it is important at this point to have a look at what happens behind the scenes in such a blocking processing type:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F7pzbwdqss0grl8oxxzdz.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>Comparing this model with the reactive programming model we see an enormous difference in complexity. The blocking model seems more simple. However, what happens, in this case, is that the main Servlet thread for each request is completely blocked until we get a response back from our SOAP service. This will limit the ability of the service to cope in scenarios where high availability from the server is required.</p>
<h4 id="362example2">3.6.2. Example 2</h4>
<p>Let’s recall from the Services explanation that this example relies on the doOnNext consumer declarations to run. Let’s try calling this multiple times in our browser:</p>
<pre><code>http://localhost:8080/seashells
</code></pre>
<p>\
If we are lucky, we’ll be able to notice that sometimes we get all the data, but also that most o the time, much of the data is actually null! Let’s look at the following two sequence diagrams which explain what happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg9dfg8v38uu4ou7ajze6.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>\
Above we can see a normal flow of data. We see that all subscribers are being called in parallel and that the doOnNext works perfectly and in sequence. By the time we get to our Netty subscriber, we are sure to get the seaShellDto object filled up with data.In most cases we won’t get the full data:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjs8hr2uyvcrs6pam3vwv.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>From the above, we see that the event call back has been emitted before the doOnNext consumers have ended their execution. In this case, the seaShellDto object has not been completely filled. Therefore we will be getting nulls.</p>
<h4 id="363example3">3.6.3. Example 3</h4>
<p>Our almost reactive example encapsulates all our blocking implementations from Example 2 and creates a publisher with it. It becomes a non-blocking thread but still does not benefit from any parallelism. This is greatly the reason why such an easy approach is also so easily found to not be very efficient.</p>
<h4 id="364example4">3.6.4. Example 4</h4>
<p>The waiting approach of example 4 basically allows the publisher to delay its execution for however amount of time is needed. We have set up 100ms in our example. We can also configure that.This is what happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6la51fjsmpg86ay6mrzy.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>Notice that with the 100ms delay, we guarantee that all doOnNext consumers are executed. However, we are also guaranteeing that we have a waiting time of 100ms for whatever request we make from the front end. This has a detrimental effect on performance.</p>
<h4 id="365example5">3.6.5. Example 5</h4>
<p>We could have gotten the idea that somehow, wrapping up a method in a publisher such as Mono or Flux, we would always create a non-blocking call. This is why I found the ForkJoin example a very good one. The act of joining a pool or submitting a Task is actually a blocking action on its own. This means that the simple fact that the ForkJoinPool is being used, renders the whole publisher a blocking publisher and blockhound will detect this publisher as being a blocking publisher.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fooqwzykc785a6udlhq5d.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>In the above diagram, everything is as simplified as possible to get an overview as to what is happening behind the scenes. In this case, WebFlux cannot work independently of the main Servlet Thread per request.</p>
<h4 id="366example6">3.6.6. Example 6</h4>
<p>In example 6, we looked into a one-by-one type of implementation. Although fully reactive, it requires an extensive amount of interaction between the client and the server. This is because filling out a form with a Shell, would require one request per object type. This means, just to give an example, that we would retrieve one request for the shell, plus the amount of costumes times two, plus the number of persons times 2 because of the accounts, plus all the costumes per person requests and so on. For one shell alone, the number of requests could be quite a lot. This could, however, be something useful in the front-end, for example, for a page that loads per piece of data, or for a page where data needs to be cached and doesn’t need to be shown imediatelly. However, in our case, we do want to get everything at once, which invalidates this solution</p>
<h4 id="367example7">3.6.7. Example 7</h4>
<p>These examples match everything we discussed in our introduction. These two examples are non-blocking, completely WebFlux supported and they provide you with data as needed. They do have different paradigms but they have already been explained in point 3.5. In example 7, though paradigms changed and it’s important that we realize that in this implementation we have voided doing anything sequential. For example, we do not process pairs in the same thread or sub-threads. All the necessary threads in example 7, only fill up one object and they take the whole seaShellDto as a common shared resource. The following diagram is an overview of what happens during the processing of all publishers in example 7:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/">  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9npr9wl4oiokaac21oth.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>With the above example, what I am trying to explain with all the arrows is that one chained block is dependent on the other and that in reality, they do wait for each other individually. For example, we cannot start requesting a Top if we don’t have a Costume. We can however ask for the Top individually without considering the Lower. These two are completely separate publishers, which constantly walk through the seaShellDto objects in order to fill it up. There are no arguments being passed around through the different publishers created with the zip function. This is why, for this example, I’ve place seaShellDto in a location where it can be globally accessible through all the different publishers.</p>
<h4 id="368example8">3.6.8. Example 8</h4>
<p>In this final example, we look at the most perfect way to wrap our legacy service. In this case, we are using immutability. We will still take advantage of the usage of parallelizing the zip function. The difference is that we won’t be using any mutable variables. I wanted to explicitly show examples with the mutable parameters in order to illustrate different characteristics of programming in a reactive way with WebFlux. Java versions from Java 14 onwards, offer lots of possibilities and one of them is the usage of records. Records are just like classes, but they are immutable and they come with very convenient implementations of the hashcode and equals methods. Mutability has the enormous problem of potentially creating side effects and unpredictable code. Using records, we will be constantly creating new objects and returning them through the streams. The example of this implementation is located in a separate module at the root of the project. The name of the module is sea-shell-service-immutable. Since this solution is, at least in my view, the most perfect for our case, I have placed it in a completely separate module.</p>

<h2 id="5conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this article, my main goal was to walk us through the processes I’ve been through to discover Reactive Programming and most of its intricacies when using this programming paradigm to wrap legacy services that for one or another reason, we are not allowed to change. In the end, our example 8 seems to be the better approach for whatever we want to develop. This way of programming is heavily based on Publisher, Subscriber principles. This can make code slightly more difficult to understand but on the other hand, it provides the advantage of allowing the server to support more requests at the same time. Imperative programming means that you can follow the code along a debug line. With the principles of reactive programming, we are basing all of our code on declarative programming. We are thus, creating code that although it may improve efficiency, does also require more effort to understand, change and update. WebFlux provides a framework that mitigates the complexity issue very well. As we have seen making publishers isn’t difficult at all. Neither is understanding them. Furthermore, we can easily debug them even though not doing so in a traditional way. Reactive programming is probably more often than not, the best decision to make. Let’s enumerate some of the reasons to move to a Reactive Programming paradigm and in this case with WebFlux:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ol>
<li>High availability — Requests should not block each other,</li>
<li>High volume — We need to be able manage high volumes of data</li>
</ol>
<p>\
The simple answer to why do we need <code>Reactive Programming</code> is sometimes simplified as "It’s just faster!". As we were able to look in our previous examples, being faster is probably just a consequence of the server supporting more requests. An individual request will not present any difference. In fact, if we compare a simple request in a Web MVC application and the same one in a Reactive MVC application, we’ll probably see that the Web MVC request is actually faster on its own.If we are thinking about changing our <code>REST</code> service model, my best advice is to just try it out. Let’s make benchmarking tests. Check our needs. <code>Reactive Programming</code> and <code>WebFlux</code> are amazing <code>state-of-the-art</code> technologies that should be used if we are managing high amounts of data. If we are managing legacy systems it can also be a very good potential first step to make everyone start thinking about a possible migration of the whole system to a better one.Remember that <code>Reactive Programming</code> is only an aspect of Reactive Architecture. The Reactive Manifesto references resilience and availability. This is why <code>Reactive Programming</code> can be a part of a Reactive Architecture. It is not the only requirement. If we program reactively, it just means that we have contributed only to a very small part of a truly reactive architecture. There is still a long way to go before our system is truly <code>Reactive</code>.Let’s make a quick recap of the terms we saw. <code>Flux</code>, <code>ParallelFlux</code>, and <code>Mono</code> are often used as <code>publishers</code>. The <code>doOnNext</code> method declares <code>methods</code> to be executed after the publisher is done. The <code>subscriber</code> does not wait for them. Calling the <code>subscriber</code> allows us to implement <code>functions</code> that happen after the <code>publisher</code> is done with the eventHandler. The zip method, allows us to create one <code>publisher</code> out of others. The <code>thenMany</code> allow us to call another publisher after the current one, returning another publisher as a result. <code>ForkJoinTasks</code> do not work with <code>WebFlux</code>, because they use the main thread when joining the <code>ForkJoinPool</code>.I trust that sharing my experience and my project, helps anyone interested in <code>WebFlux</code> to understand how this whole process works. I also hope that the examples I’ve placed on <a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/sea-shell-archiver/tree/2.0.0">GitHub</a> can help you see the difference between different implementations. Take note that my idea of creating a publisher chain of publishers using the <code>zip</code> function is just one of the many options <code>WebFlux</code> provides for chaining <code>Publishers</code>.I hope you enjoyed this article as much as I did making it!

And what are they all missing?</p>
<p>\
For the sake of brevity and holiday cheer, this issue will round up a series of recently published crypto industry reports.</p>
<p>\
Some of the reports look back at what happened in 2024, while others look forward and try to predict what will happen in 2025.</p>
<p>\
They are all useful to varying degrees. Some are entertaining in the way that fortune-tellers are entertaining. At the same time, some are informative in that they give us a glimpse of what crypto firms and operators are thinking about.</p>
<p>\
I’m sharing them because I think they will make good holiday week reading. As we enjoy the time between the old year and the new year, it feels like a chance to recheck our bearings and look at some of this stuff with a unique perspective.</p>
<p>\
Here are a few high-level observations about themes that resonate across all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everyone is super bullish that the crypto market cap will continue increasing in 2025. While there are some differences of opinion about how high the market goes, it is a shared sentiment that major crypto assets will reach new all-time highs, peaking in Q425. My take on this is to be cautious and skeptical.</p>

</ul>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Memecoins were a big story in 2024 and will continue to be a story into 2025. One thing element to the <a href="https://www.danielmcglynn.com/memecoins-are-having-a-moment/">memecoin mania</a> that we haven’t covered yet, but we will soon, is the combo of memecoins (or the monetization of attention) with AI agents (or the ability to automate finance), which will likely give rise to an entirely new way of deploying capital and follow trends with robot-like speed. Sidenote: Despite the hype, memecoins only represent a small fraction of the crypto market.</p>

</ul>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Institutional finance will enter the crypto markets. The reports all give good reasons for this—more <a href="https://www.danielmcglynn.com/what-is-the-ethereum-etf/">crypto ETFs</a>, friendlier regulations, a sense of the inevitable—but like the bullish sentiments shared above, plenty of things might derail the flood of new capital. We’ve certainly seen that in previous cycles. One wrinkle that gives this point more weight this time around is that governments now appear interested in acquiring crypto to create national <a href="https://www.danielmcglynn.com/what-is-a-bitcoin-strategic-reserve/">bitcoin reserves</a>, which feels like a new dynamic.</p>
<p>\</p>

</ul>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li><p>More global economic activity moves to stablecoins. The utility of stablecoins became a pronounced trend in 2024 and will likely continue into 2025. <a href="https://www.danielmcglynn.com/stablecoins-as-shelter/">We’ve covered this trend before</a> and talked about how interesting it is that one of crypto’s best use cases is also the most tame. VanEck predicts that stablecoin daily settlements will reach $300 billion/day in 2025.</p>

<p>\
The reports are interesting as one-offs. Collected together, they provide at least a pretty good guide of the things we should be watching or the general themes that will impact the Open Money framework.</p>

The average job search now takes six months, primarily affecting high-paying sectors like tech, law, and media. While the 4.2% unemployment rate remains below pre-pandemic averages, job postings have dropped to one per unemployed worker from two in early 2022. 

Software development, data science, and marketing roles are 20% below pre-pandemic levels, while healthcare and government sectors account for half of recent job creation. The number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits reached 1.8 million in late December, approaching post-pandemic highs, as wage growth declined to 4% from 6% during the early 2020s hiring peak.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Our universe seems fine-tuned for life, with the constants of physical laws having to be within tight boundaries. Does this mean that the universe has a goal of consciousness? Is there a directedness of the universe toward consciousness? Is consciousness entirely contingent or is it something special, even a ultimate object of universal development?

<p>\
Welcome to the third and final winners announcement, for the <strong>#bitcoin Writing Contest</strong>, presented by <strong>Rootstock</strong> and <strong>HackerNoon.</strong></p>
<p>\
What a ride it’s been! Since launching in May, the contest has seen developers, writers, Bitcoin maximalists, blockchain enthusiasts, and everyone in between tackle a range of creative and technical challenges centered around the leading cryptocurrency–bitcoin–in a year where it cracked a historic <a href="https://hackernoon.com/coins/BTC?range=month">$100k milestone.</a> </p>
<p>\
In the process, we’ve published over 200 <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/bitcoin">#bitcoin</a> stories, racking up more than <strong>400,000 pageviews</strong> and well over <strong>300 hours of reading time.</strong></p>
<p>\
Round 1 wrapped up on July 31st, rewarding 5 talented HackerNoon authors for their standout contributions. The winner was @nikku876, who took home $2,000 for his entry, <strong><em><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-dapp-on-rootstock-with-nextjs-typescript-and-solidity?ref=hackernoon.com">How to Build DApp on Rootstock with Next.js, Typescript, and Solidity</a></em></strong>. Read the Results announcement for Round 1 <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-bitcoin-writing-contest-by-rootstock-and-hackernoon-round-1-results">here</a>.</p>
<p>\
The second round closed on September 30th, seeing 5 additional winners take home cash prizes. @<strong>tomaszs</strong> won the top prize of <strong>$2,000</strong> for his entry, <strong><em><a href="https://hackernoon.com/rootstock-first-impression-through-the-eyes-of-a-front-end-developer-and-a-web-3-layman">RootStock - First Impression Through The Eyes Of A Front-end Developer And A Web 3 Layman</a></em></strong>. came in a close second, winning <strong>$1,500</strong> for <strong><em><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-telegram-bot-that-queries-rootstock-data-using-rootstock-rpc-api">How to Build a Telegram Bot That Queries Rootstock Data Using Rootstock RPC API</a></em></strong>. Read the results announcement for Round 2 <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-bitcoin-writing-contest-by-rootstock-and-hackernoon-round-2-results">here</a>.</p>
<p>\
For the just-concluded round, we had the difficult job of combing through 40 entries to select 25 finalists for the final voting round. Only entries submitted between Oct 1 &amp; Nov 30 were eligible.</p>

Artificial Intelligence (AI), e-commerce, and telecommunications require visionary leaders like <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-khurana-0629ab14">Rahul Khurana</a></strong>, Principal Architect, Technical. His 16-year career in the tech industry reflects a rare blend of technical mastery, inventive thinking, and steadfast commitment to customer-centric solutions.</p>
<h3 id="apurposedrivencareer"><strong>A Purpose-Driven Career</strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/InxBRjRIs6M1kdhuWcyNHiiUrxm1-b4134jk.jpeg" alt="Rahul Khurana" /></p>
<p>\
Khurana distinguished himself in the area of software development by creating impactful, efficient solutions. However, his desire to influence the industry at a systemic level led him to pivot to architecture. Since then, he has progressed to becoming a Principal Architect, overseeing large-scale commerce systems.</p>
<p>\
A turning point in his career came while working on a project that integrated AI into e-commerce. This task utilized machine learning to deliver a personalized, context-aware customer experience and allowed users to interact with products and services through natural language commands.</p>
<p>\
For Khurana, this was a revelation. He realized Artificial Intelligence had the power to fundamentally redefine consumer interactions. It also set the stage for his leadership in driving digital transformation initiatives with industry-first programs such as AI-powered chatbots and billing transparency systems.</p>
<h3 id="thearchitectofchange"><strong>The Architect of Change</strong></h3>
<p>At T-Mobile, Khurana has been instrumental in driving impactful initiatives like Project 10 Million and enhancing digital commerce with the Buy Online, Pickup In-Store (BOPIS) program. Project 10 Million has been a transformative effort to bridge the homework gap by providing free internet access to millions of underserved students, empowering them with the resources they need to succeed in their education. Meanwhile, BOPIS has been a game-changer in digital commerce, driving 28% of traffic, especially during new phone introductions (NPI), significantly boosting the company's digital footprint and transforming customer experiences.</p>
<p>\
He also created AI-driven personalization and contextualization innovations that have changed how businesses engage with their customers. His integration of over 300 APIs for AI-powered conversational transactions has created intuitive user engagement that prioritizes trust and transparency.</p>
<h3 id="awardsrecognitionandindustrycontributions"><strong>Awards, Recognition, and Industry Contributions</strong></h3>
<p>Khurana has received numerous accolades for his exceptional contributions, including T-Mobile's prestigious PEAK award—an honor bestowed upon only 0.001% of employees—and HCL's O2 award for three consecutive years. In 2024, he was also honored with a global recognition award for his groundbreaking work in telecommunications.</p>
<p>\
He influences the future of technology and commerce as a fellow member of the Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers (IETE) and a board member for industry journals.</p>
<p>\
Khurana has also published award-winning research, including his seminal papers "Fraud Detection in E-Commerce Payment Systems: The Role of Predictive Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time Transaction Security and Risk Management" and "Applications of Quantum Computing in Telecom E-Commerce: Analysis of QKD, QAOA, and QML for Data Encryption, Speed Optimization, and AI-Driven Customer Experience." His groundbreaking work on predictive AI for fraud detection received widespread recognition, culminating in the prestigious Best Paper Award in 2024. Similarly, his exploration of quantum computing applications in telecom e-commerce has been celebrated for its innovative approach to enhancing data security and customer experience.</p>
<p>\
In addition to his research, he holds several patents, including one on the efficient transition of mobile devices across telecommunication networks. His thought leadership is regularly sought at conferences hosted by organizations like Adobe, Amdocs, and AWS, where he shares insights on topics ranging from cloud computing to cybersecurity in e-commerce.</p>
<h3 id="leadershipthroughmentorshipandinnovation">Leadership Through Mentorship and Innovation</h3>
<p>Rahul Khurana is a dynamic leader who excels in mentoring cross-functional teams and judging digital hackathons, showcasing his ability to inspire innovation and deliver impactful results. His expertise and guidance have inspired innovation and delivered measurable outcomes in both domains.</p>
<p>\
One of his most notable achievements is the Purchase Transparency Program, a multi-billion-dollar initiative that underscores his ability to lead complex projects successfully. This program involved intricate technical integrations and strategic collaborations with industry giants like Adobe, Amdocs, and Google. Through his leadership, the program delivered customer-focused solutions that set new standards in telecom e-commerce.</p>
<h3 id="avisionforthefuture"><strong>A Vision for the Future</strong></h3>
<p>Khurana believes the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity will influence the future of online shopping by creating hyper-personalized, resilient e-commerce ecosystems.</p>
<p>\
He plans to continue mentoring the next generation of innovators, contributing to hackathons, and leading transformational projects to ensure that his vision for technology's role in business continues to grow and evolve.</p>
<p>\
Rahul Khurana is a force in Artificial Intelligence, e-commerce, and telecom. His work bridges the gap between academic studies and actionable business strategies, laying the foundation for a more dynamic, customer-focused future while addressing the challenges of today.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Bryan Johnson Approach to Eng Productivity</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hv2885/the_bryan_johnson_approach_to_eng_productivity/</link><author>/u/fosterfriendship</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 15:56:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fosterfriendship"> /u/fosterfriendship </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://smalldiffs.gmfoster.com/p/the-brian-johnson-approach-to-eng">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hv2885/the_bryan_johnson_approach_to_eng_productivity/">[comments]</a></span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MT7922 no longer causes kernel panic on resume</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1hv24zb/mt7922_no_longer_causes_kernel_panic_on_resume/</link><author>/u/NonStandardUser</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 15:52:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As of kernel 6.12.8, the Mediatek MT7922 Bluetooth chipset no longer causes the kernel to hang on resuming from suspend.

<p>\
So why post this instead of waiting until I have progress to share? </p>
<h2 id="becausethisispartofthedesignprocess">Because this is part of the design process.</h2>
<p>Sometimes we make a lot of progress and sometimes we don't. We all have competing priorities in our work and life.</p>
<p>\
Slowing down is not a bad thing when it comes to design. Because it allows us to return to our creation with fresh eyes. And bring new ideas to it. </p>
<p>\
One reason I have not made much progress on this new game is because I was working on finishing two other board games and a software simulation. An interesting thing I have learned about designing new products is just as you feel like you are getting close to finishing, a lot of new tasks seem to appear. So you end up spending more time at the end than you expected.</p>
<p>\
But it's all good because some of the thinking I had to do for those other games may find its way to enhance this new game. And, any problems I had to solve with other games are problems I no longer have to solve with this new game.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's Next?</h2>
<p>The gameplay is far enough along that my next step is to do some testing, so I printed these sheets and cards. The sheets represent the gameboard and list each of the main spaces. Very rough, as you can see, but that's all we need to do some quick testing to see how it flows. Stay tuned for the results in my next update.</p>

Of the more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants, all have been charged with some form of trespassing or disorderly conduct and more than a third have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Some, like Joseph Biggs, a leader of the Proud Boys, are already lobbying for pardons. 

WSJ spoke to experts and those involved in the day on what it would take for Trump to follow through on that promise.

At this time it was known as <code>CQS</code> (Command Query Separation). <code>CQRS</code> was finally introduced by <code>Greg Young</code> in <code>2010</code>. This software architecture is designed to mitigate known caveats of <code>Object-Oriented architecture</code>. Specifically in this case, these caveats are:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes and reads generate, almost all the time, a very different load against the system.</li>
<li>Writing operations are often much more complicated than reading and they affect different scopes of the application. Write operations need to guarantee that correct, validated and consistent data reaches the store correctly.</li>
<li>Security concerns are also different between write and read operations.</li>
<li>The way data is normally stored in the database is in a 3NF or in another optimized form. When we read data, we often use it to build views to provide the user with readable data. The data presented to the user is hardly ever normalized. This is also referred to as denormalized data. In other words, we present the data to the user with the only concern that the user can read it.</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Through this very simple list, you can see that reading and writing operate in different ways, they have different concerns, they generate different performance concerns, and they generate different loads which can put a lot of strain on the system in very different ways.</p>
<p>\
<code>CQRS</code> is also a form of <code>DDD</code>(Domain Driven Design). It wasn’t initially thought out to be an actual <code>DDD</code>. Every application has at least one bounded context. Bounded contexts are difficult to define but essentially, they isolate a responsibility of the application like for example, handing of debit cards, library book archiver, and patient data. The latter for example can be divided into multiple subdomains. There could be a separate domain to keep track of chronic illnesses like HIV and another different one to keep track of the common flu. Both of them have different data concerns. Being a chronic disease, HIV patients will need to keep track of a lot more data like T-Cell count, virus load, and other blood data for a lifetime. Patients with the flu don’t need so much monitoring. There are a lot more privacy concerns related to the first domain than the latter. Assessing domains is a bit of an art and it requires the analytical skills of the engineer to determine them.Once you have defined your domain, it’s time to start the design of CQRS for it. As you may have already seen, this design has as its main concern, the separation of reading operations and writing operations. Write operations cannot be read operations. In the same way, “read” operations also cannot be “write” operations.</p>
<p>\
We will look into the source code I’m providing on <a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/video-series-app">GitHub</a> So let's start!</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
<p>Commands are defined as any operation that can mutate the data without returning a value. In essence, these all write operations. In CRUD terms, these are the Creation, Update, and Delete operations. You may also refer to them as CUD. The Read operation is implicitly not a part of the operations we need for the Command side of our application.</p>
<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>
<p>Queries are defined as any operation that will never mutate data and will always return values. Ultimately these are all read operations. Query operations are only read operations. They are only the R in CRUD terms.</p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<p>There are many ways to implement CQRS. The point is always to keep read operations apart from write operations as much as possible. In our implementation, we are also going to separate operations and use Event Sourcing. This will allow us to further separate the medium where we are going to keep our data. We will use two different databases. One database will be a part of the command flows and the other database will be part of the read flows.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Let’s first have a look at how all the moving parts will work:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/video-series-app">    <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmede8nmlcxg9oheodnbn.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<p>\
In this example, I’m going to try to make this as simple as possible. There are much more elaborated options out there. There are more complicated, dynamic, and scalable options out there. One of these options would be to use RabbitMQ or any other kind of message queueing system to further decouple all components. However, may lead the attention out of the scope of this tutorial. The point here is to present a solution with all the fundamental points of CQRS at its core.We are going to need a lot of dependencies, but for our example, we will focus on the Axon dependencies. You can find a complete listing of all the dependencies used in this example in the root pom.xml:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code>&lt;project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"&gt;
    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    ...
    &lt;dependencyManagement&gt;
        &lt;dependencies&gt;
            ...
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.axonframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;axon-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;${axon.version}&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;exclusions&gt;
                    &lt;exclusion&gt;
                        &lt;groupId&gt;org.axonframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
                        &lt;artifactId&gt;axon-server-connector&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                    &lt;/exclusion&gt;
                &lt;/exclusions&gt;
            &lt;/dependency&gt;
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.axonframework.extensions.mongo&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;axon-mongo&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;${axon-mongo.version}&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;/dependency&gt;
            &lt;dependency&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;version&gt;${lombok.version}&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;optional&gt;true&lt;/optional&gt;
            &lt;/dependency&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/dependencies&gt;
    &lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;
    ...
&lt;/project&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>\
Notice that I am using the axon framework. This is one of the most popular frameworks to implement the CQRS design. Namely, we are going to see how EventHandlers and Aggregators work, how the EventBus works, and how the CommandBus works. We are also going to see how this works with MongoDB in order to, ultimately, get our database updated with new data.</p>
<h2 id="core">Core</h2>
<p>In this module, I’m going to consider everything that would be common to the application. I could also have named this module as common. For our application to run, we are going to need to consider a few important things. Given its complexity, I am only going to implement a read-all operation and a save operation. These will be my query and my command respectively. We’ll need a DTO to get our data into our system:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public record VideoSeriesDto(
        String name,
        Integer volumes,
        BigDecimal cashValue,
        Genre genre
) {
    @Builder
    public VideoSeriesDto {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Sending data via a writer is an operation that needs to be understood by the reader and also by the writer. Our only common command should be located here:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Builder
public class AddSeriesEvent {
    String id;
    String name;
    Integer volumes;
    BigDecimal cashValue;
    Genre genre;
...(
    getters and
    setters ommitted)
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Finally, we know from the schema, that both the “write service” and the “read service” will need to have access to the EventStore. This essentially is, at the end of the tail, our MongoDB database. Axon has very nice out-of-the-box libraries that allow us to easily implement this Event Sourcing mechanism. this is part of the reason why I chose this. It makes for a very simple form of implementation:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Configuration
public class AxonConfig {

    @Value("${spring.data.mongodb.host:127.0.0.1}")
    private String mongoHost;

    @Value("${spring.data.mongodb.port:27017}")
    private int mongoPort;

    @Value("${spring.data.mongodb.database:test}")
    private String mongoDatabase;

    @Bean
    public TokenStore tokenStore(Serializer serializer) {
        return MongoTokenStore.builder().mongoTemplate(axonMongoTemplate()).serializer(serializer).build();
    }

    @Bean
    public EventStorageEngine eventStorageEngine(MongoClient client) {
        return MongoEventStorageEngine.builder().mongoTemplate(DefaultMongoTemplate.builder().mongoDatabase(client).build()).build();
    }

    @Bean
    public MongoTemplate axonMongoTemplate() {
        return DefaultMongoTemplate.builder().mongoDatabase(mongo(), mongoDatabase).build();
    }

    @Bean
    public MongoClient mongo() {
        return MongoClients.create(
                MongoClientSettings.builder()
                        .applyToClusterSettings(builder -&gt;
                                builder.hosts(List.of(
                                        new ServerAddress(mongoHost, mongoPort))))
                        .build());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="commandservice">Command Service</h2>
<p>First, we need to implement a representation of our command. In the case of our command service, we only have a command to add further video series. Therefore, our command has the same properties as the actual series. Note the id field:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Data
@Builder
@EqualsAndHashCode
@ToString
public class AddVideoSeriesCommand {

    @TargetAggregateIdentifier
    private String id;

    private String name;

    private Integer volumes;

    private BigDecimal cashValue;

    private Genre genre;

}
</code></pre>
<p>\
\
The id field is indeed a String. This is essentially our operation ID. It can be implemented in several ways. We just need to make sure that it is always a unique string, number, or whatever we choose.Now it’s time to implement the aggregator which will send our command through the command bus and make it reach our command handler:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Slf4j  
@NoArgsConstructor  
@Aggregate  
@Data  
public class VideoSeriesAggregate {

    @AggregateIdentifier  
    private String id;  

    @CommandHandler  
    public VideoSeriesAggregate(AddVideoSeriesCommand command) {  
        apply(AddSeriesEvent.builder()  
                .id(UUID.randomUUID().toString())  
                .cashValue(command.getCashValue())  
                .genre(command.getGenre())  
                .name(command.getName())  
                .volumes(command.getVolumes()).build()  
        );  
    }  

    @EventSourcingHandler  
    public void on(AddSeriesEvent event) {  
        this.id = event.getId();  
    }  

}  
</code></pre>
<p>\
Notice the EventSourcingHandler. It doesn’t seem to be doing much, but remember that in this code section you are looking at the contents of the Aggregate element. If you look at the mongo database you will find something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">{  
"_id" : ObjectId("5df8ac587a0bba4960afce68"),  
"aggregateIdentifier" : "ed313d16-8d94-480a-85a0-b6897bcca4f5",  
"type" : "SeriesAggregate",  
"sequenceNumber" : NumberLong(0),  
"serializedPayload" : "&lt;org.jesperancinha.video.core.events.AddSeriesEvent&gt;&lt;id&gt;ed313d16-8d94-480a-85a0-b6897bcca4f5&lt;/id&gt;&lt;name&gt;wosssda&lt;/name&gt;&lt;volumes&gt;10&lt;/volumes&gt;&lt;cashValue&gt;123.2&lt;/cashValue&gt;&lt;genre&gt;woo&lt;/genre&gt;&lt;/org.jesperancinha.video.core.events.AddSeriesEvent&gt;",  
"timestamp" : "2019-12-17T10:22:16.640261Z",  
"payloadType" : "org.jesperancinha.video.core.events.AddSeriesEvent",  
"payloadRevision" : null,  
"serializedMetaData" : "&lt;meta-data&gt;&lt;entry&gt;&lt;string&gt;traceId&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;398a250f-8086-40e7-a767-1aa793231f62&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/entry&gt;&lt;entry&gt;&lt;string&gt;correlationId&lt;/string&gt;&lt;string&gt;398a250f-8086-40e7-a767-1aa793231f62&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/entry&gt;&lt;/meta-data&gt;",  
"eventIdentifier" : "2ac1a49f-0124-4f6e-b13f-140c8f36979a"  
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
\
Notice the aggregateIndentifier. This is our id. You need the EventSourcingHandler in order to complete the request and have your Event sourced to the EventStore.Now we only need to complete our application by implementing a Controller:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@RestController
@RequestMapping("/video-series")
public class VideoSeriesController {

    private final CommandGateway commandGateway;

    public VideoSeriesController(CommandGateway commandGateway) {
        this.commandGateway = commandGateway;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public void postNewVideoSeries(
            @RequestBody
                    VideoSeriesDto videoSeriesDto) {
        commandGateway.send(
                AddVideoSeriesCommand.builder()
                        .name(videoSeriesDto.name())
                        .volumes(videoSeriesDto.volumes())
                        .genre(videoSeriesDto.genre())
                        .cashValue(videoSeriesDto.cashValue())
                        .build());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Notice that we are injecting a CommandGateway. This is precisely the gateway that allows us to send commands into our system.Finally, the Spring Boot Launcher:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@SpringBootApplication
@Import(AxonConfig.class)
public class VideoAppCommandLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(VideoAppCommandLauncher.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
To complete our application we still need to configure our Spring Boot Launcher:</p>
<pre><code># spring
server.port=8080
# mongodb
spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
spring.data.mongodb.database=cqrs
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<h2 id="queryservice">Query Service</h2>
<p>\
The query service is essentially a reader of the EventStore and will act upon it without the user intervention. The query service needs to perform queries. In this way, I implemented a command to do that just that:public class FindAllVideoSeriesQuery {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>\
Notice that this command ended up being just an empty class. That is done on purpose. We do not need parameters to pass through a read all operation, but we do need its representation.Because we are accessing a database and storing records, we now need to implement the Entity responsible for this data:</p>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@Builder
@Entity
@Table(name = "VIDEO_SERIES")
public class VideoSeries {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
    @Column
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Integer volumes;

    @Column
    private BigDecimal cashValue;

    @Column
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Genre genre;

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || Hibernate.getClass(this) != Hibernate.getClass(o)) return false;
        VideoSeries that = (VideoSeries) o;

        return Objects.equals(id, that.id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(getId(), getName(), getVolumes(), getCashValue(), getGenre());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
As you may already have guessed, in this implementation we are going to use JPA repositories:public interface VideoSeriesRepository extends JpaRepository {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>\
On the query side, we have EventHandlers which are very similar in shape to the Aggregate. The difference, of course, is that they process immediately once they receive a command event:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Service  
@ProcessingGroup("video-series")  
public class VideoSeriesEventHandler {

    private final VideoSeriesRepository videoSeriesRepository;  

    public VideoSeriesEventHandler(VideoSeriesRepository videoSeriesRepository) {  
        this.videoSeriesRepository = videoSeriesRepository;  
    }  

    @EventHandler  
    public void on(AddSeriesEvent event) {  
        videoSeriesRepository.save(VideoSeries  
                .builder()  
                .name(event.getName())  
                .volumes(event.getVolumes())  
                .genre(event.getGenre())  
                .cashValue(event.getCashValue())  
                .build());  
    }  

    @QueryHandler  
    public List&lt;VideoSeriesDto&gt; handle(FindAllVideoSeriesQuery query) {  
        return videoSeriesRepository.findAll().stream().map(  
                videoSeries -&gt; VideoSeriesDto.builder()  
                        .name(videoSeries.getName())  
                        .volumes(videoSeries.getVolumes())  
                        .cashValue(videoSeries.getCashValue())  
                        .genre(videoSeries.getGenre())  
                        .build()).collect(Collectors.toList());  
    }  

}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Notice that instead of CommandHandler, we now have QueryHandler. Instead of EventSourcingHandler we now have EventHandler. There are annotations used to distinguish what happens in the command service and in the query service respectively. Also, the id isn’t there. The id isn’t important because no data will be going to the event store. All the data is handled directly with the JPA repositories. We can now focus our attention on the Controller for the query service controller:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@RestController  
@RequestMapping("/video-series")  
public class VideoSeriesController {

    @Autowired  
    private QueryGateway queryGateway;  

    @GetMapping  
    public List&lt;VideoSeriesDto&gt; gertAllVideoSeries() {  
        return queryGateway.query(new FindAllVideoSeriesQuery(), ResponseTypes.multipleInstancesOf(VideoSeriesDto.class))  
                .join();  
    }  
}  
</code></pre>
<p>\
And finally our Query Spring Boot Launcher:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@SpringBootApplication
@Import(AxonConfig.class)
public class VideoAppQueryLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(VideoAppQueryLauncher.class);
    }
}  
</code></pre>
<p>\
To complete our application we need to configure it:</p>
<pre><code># spring
server.port=8090
# h2
spring.h2.console.path=/spring-h2-video-series-query-console
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
# datasource
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:~/spring-datasource-video-series-query-file;auto_server=true
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=sa
spring.sql.init.schema-locations=classpath*:schema-h2.sql
spring.sql.init.mode=always
# hibernate
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
# mongodb
spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
spring.data.mongodb.database=cqrs
</code></pre>
<p>\
Give it some structure:</p>
<pre><code class="sql language-sql">drop table if exists VIDEO_SERIES;

create table VIDEO_SERIES  
(  
ID         bigint auto_increment primary key not null,  
NAME       varchar(100)                      not null,  
VOLUMES    int                               not null,  
CASH_VALUE decimal                           not null,  
GENRE      varchar(100)                      not null  
);
</code></pre>
<p>\
And finally some data:</p>
<pre><code class="sql language-sql">insert into VIDEO_SERIES (NAME, VOLUMES, CASH_VALUE, GENRE) values ('Modern Family', 12, 12.3, 'SITCOM');  
insert into VIDEO_SERIES (NAME, VOLUMES, CASH_VALUE, GENRE) values ('Six Feet Under', 10, 34.3, 'DRAMA');  
insert into VIDEO_SERIES (NAME, VOLUMES, CASH_VALUE, GENRE) values ('Queer as Folk', 24, 55.3, 'DRAMA');
</code></pre>
<p>\
We are almost ready to make some tests. We need now consider how are we going to launch our persistence databases. In our example, we mention 2 important ones: MongoDB and H2. In the code, you’ll find also Postgres in other configurations. There are multiple ways to start this application combo. In the default profile, there only needs to be a running MondDB database on port 27017. We can do this by installing mongo or by using containers. This is why you’ll find three profiles on both the command and the query SpringBoot applications:</p>
<p>\</p>
<ul>
<li>default — Runs with MongoDB and embedded H2 — run with make docker-mongo or with a local running MongoDB</li>
<li>local — Runs with MongoDB and Postgres — run with make docker-databases or with local running MongoDB and Postgres databases</li>
<li>prod — Runs with MongoDB and Postgres in a common network with docker-compose — Just run make build-docker and the system will be set up for you</li>
</ul>
<p>\
Check the Readme.md file for further details on how to run this on your machine.What I did for testing is very simple. First I performed a request to see all my current data:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">curl localhost:8090/video-series
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">[
  {
    "name": "Modern Family",
    "volumes": 12,
    "cashValue": 12.3,
    "genre": "SITCOM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Six Feet Under",
    "volumes": 10,
    "cashValue": 34.3,
    "genre": "DRAMA"
  },
  {
    "name": "Queer as Folk",
    "volumes": 24,
    "cashValue": 55.3,
    "genre": "DRAMA"
  }
]
</code></pre>
<p>\
As you can see, we get three series. Let’s add a new one:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">curl -d '{ "name":"True Blood", "volumes":30, "cashValue": 1323.2, "genre": "Drama"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/video-series
</code></pre>
<p>\
You should now see:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">curl localhost:8090/video-series
</code></pre>
<p>\</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">[
  {
    "name": "Modern Family",
    "volumes": 12,
    "cashValue": 12.3,
    "genre": "SITCOM"
  },
  {
    "name": "Six Feet Under",
    "volumes": 10,
    "cashValue": 34.3,
    "genre": "DRAMA"
  },
  {
    "name": "Queer as Folk",
    "volumes": 24,
    "cashValue": 55.3,
    "genre": "DRAMA"
  },
  {
    "name": "True Blood",
    "volumes": 30,
    "cashValue": 1323.2,
    "genre": "Bloody"
  }
]
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Note that although we can see that this works, it’s very important that you understand what happened behind the curtain for this application. The separation between the “write” and “read”, referred to as segregation of command and query is what makes the foundations of this architecture. The more decoupled the architecture is designed, the better it is. There are thousands of corner cases and special situations in the landscape of DDD and CQRS. Event sourcing is just one of the ways to get this implemented. In our example, we used Spring, SpringBoot, and Axon to get our commands and events across our network. We didn’t use any messaging queuing system. I do intend to write another article on that, but that will be for later. For the time being, I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial about this very simple example.You’ve probably noticed that I’m not using Java records everywhere. This is because in some instances I could not get the Axon converters to work with records, namely with the AddSeriesEvent. This issue is being resolved. Have a look at the issues document for more details on this.Have a look at the unit and integration tests. There I’ve used Kotlin, Kotest, Testcontainers, and Mockk, which are modern alternatives for Java, Jupiter 5, and Embedded databases. There is an example that goes through the whole architecture and tests the flow from issuing a command to handling the event, to storing and querying it back from the database.</p>

This is one of the many forms of DDD(Domain Driven Design Architecture). The goal was to find a way to solve or otherwise mitigate general caveats introduced by object-oriented programming. This is also known as Ports and Adapters architecture. The hexagon concept isn’t related to a six-side architecture nor does it have anything to do with the geometrical form. A hexagon has six sides indeed, but the idea is to illustrate the concept of many ports. This shape is also easier to split into two and to be used as a representation of the business logic of the application. The idea is to separate the application we want to develop into essentially three separate parts. The left, the core and the right. Going into an even broader concept we want to differentiate the concepts of inside and outside. Inside is the business logic and the application itself and outside is whatever we are using to connect and interact with the application.</p>
<h2 id="core">Core</h2>
<p>The core of an application can be defined as the place where the business logic of the application happens. An application core receives data, performs operations on it and optionally may communicate with other external parties like databases or persistence entities.</p>
<h2 id="ports">Ports</h2>
<p>Ports represent the boundaries of the application. Frequently they are implemented as interfaces to be used by outside parties. Their implementation resides outside the application, although they share the same domain.</p>
<h3 id="primaryports">Primary ports</h3>
<p>Primary ports are also known as driving ports. These are the first communication points between the outside and the application core. Therefore, they can still be otherwise known as Inbound Ports. These ports “drive” the application. This means that this is where requests get through to the application. The upstream in this case contains data and the downstream contains the response to that request. Primary ports reside on the left side of the hexagon.</p>
<h3 id="secondaryports">Secondary ports</h3>
<p>Secondary ports are in contrast known as driven ports. These also live on the outside and symmetrically to the primary ports they live on the right side of the hexagon. The application core uses secondary ports to upstream data to external entities. For example, an operation that needs data from the database will use a secondary port. The application “drives” the port in order to get data. The downstream contains thus the data coming from external entities on the right. Because the application sends data to the outside, secondary ports also get called Outbound Ports.</p>
<h2 id="adapters">Adapters</h2>
<p>Adapters are essentially the implementation of ports. They are not supposed to be called directly at any point in the code.</p>
<h3 id="primaryadapters">Primary adapters</h3>
<p>Primary adapters are implementations of primary ports. These are completely independent of the application core. This presents one of the clear advantages of this architecture. By implementing a port on the outside, we have control over how the implementation is done. This means that we can freely implement different forms of getting the data through to the application, without affecting the application itself. Just as ports primary adapters can also be called driving adapters. Examples of this are REST services and GUIs.</p>
<h3 id="secondaryadapters">Secondary adapters</h3>
<p>Secondary adapters are implementations of secondary ports. Just as primary adapters, these are also independent of the application core with the same clear advantage. More often, we find that it’s in the secondary ports that lie the more difficult questions regarding the choice of technology. Frequently there is always the question of how we actually want to implement a persistence layer. It can be difficult to choose the right database, file system, or anything else. By using adapters, we can easily interchange adapters as we want. This means that regardless of the implementation, our application also does not change. It will only know the operations it needs to call and has no idea of how they are implemented. In the same way as primary adapters, secondary adapters are also referred to as driven adapters.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>This application manages a lyric’s storage system. It stores the related artist and a lyrics text. We can then access an endpoint that will randomly show a certain lyric and the related artist. We can also perform all other POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET operations to perform CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via JPA(Java Persistence API) repositories. I purposely made this application simple and with common operations. It is important to understand concepts like core, domain, and infrastructure and this is also the reason why I created this application with all of these operations.</p>

<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>In the previous points, I’ve mentioned a few keywords that are important in order to set up our application. Since this is a demo application, a few considerations are important. I want the application to be simple, but also to represent what most applications do at its core. Most applications have a persistence framework, a business model, and a presentation layer. In this example, I have chosen Spring in order to use the MVC(Model View Controller) pattern. If you want to know more about the MVC pattern please follow the links below in the references section. To run the application we are going to use Spring Boot. To access our database I am using JPA repositories and finally, I have chosen an H2 in-memory database. You will also see that I’m using JUnit Jupiter, Mockito, and AssertJ. These are off the scope of this tutorial, but if you are interested in learning more about these frameworks, then please follow the links below in the references section.</p>

    &lt;/build&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;

<h2 id="domain">Domain</h2>
<p>Let’s have a look at what we need as a domain. Domain is in this case is anything that we can share between the core of the application and the ports.</p>
<p>\
The first thing to do is to define how we want data to be transferred around. In our case we do this via a DTO (Data Transfer Object):</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public record LyricsDto(
        String lyrics,
        String participatingArtist
) {

    @Builder
    public LyricsDto {
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Normally you may need an exception that can be propagated throughout your architecture. This is a valid, but also very simplistic approach. Further discussion on this would require a new article and it goes off the scope of this article:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public class LyricsNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {

    public LyricsNotFoundException(UUID id) {
        super("Lyrics with id %s not found!".formatted(id));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Furthermore, this is where you create your outbound port. In our case and at this point we know we want persistence, but we are not interested in how it’s implemented. This is why we only create an interface at this point.</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public interface LyricsPersistencePort {

    void addLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    void removeLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    void updateLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    List&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getAllLyrics();

    LyricsDto getLyricsById(UUID lyricsId);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Notice that our interface declares all necessary CRUD methods.</p>
<h2 id="core-1">Core</h2>
<p>\
Core works hand in hand with Domain. Both of them could be incorporated into one single module. However, this separation is very important because it makes core an implementation of only the business logic.Core is where we find our service interface:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public interface LyricsService {

    void addLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    void removeLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    void updateLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    List&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getAllLyrics();

    LyricsDto getLyricsById(UUID lyricsId);

}
</code></pre>
<p>\
And its implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Service
public class LyricsServiceImpl implements LyricsService {

    private final LyricsPersistencePort lyricsPersistencePort;

    public LyricsServiceImpl(LyricsPersistencePort lyricsPersistencePort) {
        this.lyricsPersistencePort = lyricsPersistencePort;
    }

    @Override
    public void addLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsPersistencePort.addLyrics(lyricsDto);
    }

    @Override
    @Transactional
    public void removeLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsPersistencePort.removeLyrics(lyricsDto);
    }

    @Override
    public void updateLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsPersistencePort.updateLyrics(lyricsDto);
    }

    @Override
    public List&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getAllLyrics() {
        return lyricsPersistencePort.getAllLyrics();
    }

    @Override
    public LyricsDto getLyricsById(UUID lyricsId) {
        return lyricsPersistencePort.getLyricsById(lyricsId);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Changes in core also represent changes in the business logic and this is why, for small applications there isn’t really a reason to further separate the port and the adapter into different modules. However, increased complexity may lead to splitting up the core into other different cores with different responsibilities. Take note that external modules should only use the interface and not the implementation of it.</p>
<h2 id="jpa">JPA</h2>
<p>Let’s create an entity. First, we should create an entity that reflects the data we want to save. In this case we need to think about the participatingArtist and the lyrics themselves. Because it’s an entity, it also needs its ID. Please note that Artist is a field that could be set into another entity. I’m not doing that in this example because it would add further complexity and another ER(entity relationship) database paradigm, which is off the scope:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
@Entity
@Table(name = "lyrics")
@Getter
@Setter
@ToString
public class LyricsEntity {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
    @Column
    private UUID id;

    @Column
    private String lyrics;

    @Column
    private String participatingArtist;

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || Hibernate.getClass(this) != Hibernate.getClass(o)) return false;
        LyricsEntity that = (LyricsEntity) o;
        return id != null &amp;&amp; Objects.equals(id, that.id);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return getClass().hashCode();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Now we can implement our JPA repository implementation. It will be our outbound port. This is where our CRUD lives:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public interface LyricsRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;LyricsEntity, UUID&gt; {

    void deleteAllByParticipatingArtist(String name);

    LyricsEntity findByParticipatingArtist(String Name);

    LyricsEntity findByLyrics(String Lyrics);
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Finally, we can implement our port. This is a step between the core and the JPA repository. This is our adapter and it’s the implementation of how we want to access our JPA repository:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Service
public class LyricsJpaAdapter implements LyricsPersistencePort {

    private final LyricsRepository lyricsRepository;

    public LyricsJpaAdapter(LyricsRepository lyricsRepository) {
        this.lyricsRepository = lyricsRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public void addLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        final LyricsEntity lyricsEntity = getLyricsEntity(lyricsDto);
        lyricsRepository.save(lyricsEntity);
    }

    @Override
    public void removeLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsRepository.deleteAllByParticipatingArtist(lyricsDto.getParticipatingArtist());
    }

    @Override
    public void updateLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        final LyricsEntity byParticipatingArtist = lyricsRepository.findByParticipatingArtist(lyricsDto.getParticipatingArtist());
        if (Objects.nonNull(byParticipatingArtist)) {
            byParticipatingArtist.setLyrics(lyricsDto.getLyrics());
            lyricsRepository.save(byParticipatingArtist);
        } else {
            final LyricsEntity byLyrics = lyricsRepository.findByLyrics(lyricsDto.getLyrics());
            if (Objects.nonNull(byLyrics)) {
                byLyrics.setParticipatingArtist(lyricsDto.getParticipatingArtist());
                lyricsRepository.save(byLyrics);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public List&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getAllLyrics() {
        return lyricsRepository.findAll()
                .stream()
                .map(this::getLyrics)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    @SneakyThrows
    @Override
    public LyricsDto getLyricsById(UUID lyricsId) {
        return getLyrics(lyricsRepository.findById(lyricsId)
                .orElseThrow((Supplier&lt;Throwable&gt;) () -&gt; new LyricsNotFoundException(lyricsId)));
    }

    private LyricsEntity getLyricsEntity(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        return LyricsEntity.builder()
                .participatingArtist(lyricsDto.getParticipatingArtist())
                .lyrics(lyricsDto.getLyrics())
                .build();
    }

    private LyricsDto getLyrics(LyricsEntity lyricsEntity) {
        return LyricsDto.builder()
                .participatingArtist(lyricsEntity.getParticipatingArtist())
                .lyrics(lyricsEntity.getLyrics())
                .build();
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>\
This completes our application implementation on the right side. Note that I’ve implemented the update operation very simplistically. If the coming DTO already has a parallel via the participatingArtist then update the lyrics. If the coming DTO already has a parallel via the lyrics then update the participatingArtist. Also notice the getLyricsById method. It will throw the domain defined LyricsNotFoundException if the lyrics with the specified ID do not exist. All mechanisms are in place to access the database. Next we are going to see the implementation of a REST service which uses the inbound port to upstream data to the application.RESTI used the typical way to implement a rest service using the Spring MVC framework. Essentially all we need is firstly an interface to define what we need in our requests. This is, in other words, our inbound port:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">public interface LyricsController {

    @PostMapping("/lyrics")
    ResponseEntity&lt;Void&gt; addLyrics(
            @RequestBody
                    LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    @DeleteMapping("/lyrics")
    ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; removeLyrics(
            @RequestBody
                    LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    @PutMapping("/lyrics")
    ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; updateLyrics(
            @RequestBody
                    LyricsDto lyricsDto);

    @GetMapping("/lyrics/{lyricsId}")
    ResponseEntity&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getLyricsById(
            @PathVariable
                    UUID lyricsId);

    @GetMapping("/lyrics")
    ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;LyricsDto&gt;&gt; getLyrics();

    @GetMapping("/lyrics/random")
    ResponseEntity&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getRandomLyric();

}
</code></pre>
<p>\
And finally its implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@Slf4j
@RestController
public class LyricsControllerImpl implements LyricsController {

    private final LyricsService lyricsService;

    private final Random random = new Random();

    public LyricsControllerImpl(LyricsService lyricsService) {
        this.lyricsService = lyricsService;
    }

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity&lt;Void&gt; addLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsService.addLyrics(lyricsDto);
        return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.CREATED);
    }

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; removeLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsService.removeLyrics(lyricsDto);
        return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; updateLyrics(LyricsDto lyricsDto) {
        lyricsService.updateLyrics(lyricsDto);
        return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getLyricsById(UUID lyricsId) {
        try {
            return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(lyricsService.getLyricsById(lyricsId), HttpStatus.OK);
        } catch (LyricsNotFoundException ex) {
            log.error("Error!", ex);
            return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;LyricsDto&gt;&gt; getLyrics() {
        return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(lyricsService.getAllLyrics(), HttpStatus.OK);
    }

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity&lt;LyricsDto&gt; getRandomLyric() {
        final List&lt;LyricsDto&gt; allLyrics = lyricsService.getAllLyrics();
        final int size = allLyrics.size();
        return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(allLyrics.get(random.nextInt(size)), HttpStatus.OK);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Here we have a complete typical rest service implemented where we can create lyrics, update lyrics, delete lyrics and read lyrics. We can do the latter in three different ways. We can read all of them, get one by id or just get one randomly. Application wise we have everything ready. What we still don’t have at this point is the Spring environment and the Spring Boot Launcher. Let’s have a look at this next.Spring BootOur application needs a launcher to get started. This is accomplished with Spring Boot:</p>
<pre><code class="java language-java">@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class LyricsDemoApplicationLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LyricsDemoApplicationLauncher.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>\
Then we need to configure our environment and make sure that Spring Boot is aware of H2 and the JPA environment. You do this in the application.properties file:</p>
<pre><code># Postgres
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.0.11:5432/fla?currentSchema=hexadecimal
spring.datasource.username=fla
spring.datasource.password=admin
spring.sql.init.mode=never
# Hibernate
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
# Flyway
spring.flyway.enabled=true
spring.flyway.baseline-on-migrate=true
spring.flyway.url=${spring.datasource.url}
spring.flyway.user=${spring.datasource.username}
spring.flyway.password=${spring.datasource.password}
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:/db
</code></pre>
<p>\
Luckily for us spring will look for the schema file with the name schema.sql. So let’s create our very basic schema:</p>
<pre><code class="sql language-sql">create schema if not exists hexadecimal;
drop table if exists hexadecimal.LYRICS;

create table hexadecimal.LYRICS
(
ID                   UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
PARTICIPATING_ARTIST VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
LYRICS               VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
</code></pre>
<p>\
Spring, also looks for data.sql. So let’s put in some data:</p>
<pre><code class="sql language-sql">insert into LYRICS (PARTICIPATING_ARTIST, LYRICS) values ('William Orbit', 'Sky fits heaven so fly it');
insert into LYRICS (PARTICIPATING_ARTIST, LYRICS) values ('Ava Max', 'Baby I''m torn');
insert into LYRICS (PARTICIPATING_ARTIST, LYRICS) values ('Faun', 'Wenn wir uns wiedersehen');
insert into LYRICS (PARTICIPATING_ARTIST, LYRICS) values ('Abel', 'Het is al lang verleden tijd');
insert into LYRICS (PARTICIPATING_ARTIST, LYRICS) values ('Billie Eilish', 'Chest always so puffed guy');
</code></pre>
<p>\
We are now ready. Now it’s all about starting the application and making tests. To do this, we have to make sure that we have Java SDK 17 installed and Node JS 16 or any version above these. They just have to be LTS versions. I have made scripts and created instructions about this in the Readme.md file located at the root of the project. Once you have this you need to make sure you have docker. Then please have a look at the Makefile at the root where I have created handy scripts for the project. Once all of this is checked, you can just run:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">make docker-clean-build-start
</code></pre>
<p>\
Alternatively, you can run:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">mvn clean install
cd favourite-lyrics-gui
yarn build
cd ..
docker-compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>\
\
This should start the application in a docker-compose environment.All methods should be easily testable via curl or postman. As an example you can use curl to get a random lyric:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">curl localhost:8080/lyrics/random
</code></pre>
<p>\
And the result could be:</p>
<pre><code class="json language-json">{“lyrics”:”Chest always so puffed guy”,”participatingArtist”:”Billie Eilish”}
</code></pre>
<p>\
On the GUI you should see something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/favourite-lyrics-app">   <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmyoda1cb4lixuiq5rh3s.jpg" alt="blogcenter" /></a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>\
This has been an exercise to mostly understand the hexagonal architecture principles. Using Spring is just one possibility. You can implement this architecture with other languages. You can find original examples in C#, Python, Ruby, and many other languages. In the Java landscape, you can do this also with any EE framework like JavaEE, JakartaEE, or any other enterprise framework. The point is to always remember to isolate the inside from the outside and make sure that the communication is clear via ports and that the implementation via adapters remains independent of the application core.I have implemented this application with different modules which represented different responsibilities. However, you may also implement this in a single module. You can try that and you will see that the principles don’t really change. The only difference is that separate modules allow you to make changes independently and allow you to create different versions of your modules. In one single module, you will have to make releases of everything at the same time as a follow-up to code changes. However, both ways respect and follow this architecture, because, in the end, the point is to make interfaces and to use them in the data streaming instead of their implementations. Their implementations will be used underwater, and they are interchangeable without affecting the inside also known as the application core.I have placed all the source code of this application in <a href="https://github.com/jesperancinha/favourite-lyrics-app">GitHub</a>.I hope that you have enjoyed this article as much as I enjoyed writing it.</p>

I get around 7Gbits/sec.</p> <p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/yfm33khopdbe1.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf1f3319e02bd3af6fdaf4a9abff85be4e65da7a">https://preview.redd.it/yfm33khopdbe1.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf1f3319e02bd3af6fdaf4a9abff85be4e65da7a</a></p> <p>What do you think the problem may be? Do you have any suggestion to fixing this?</p> <p>Note: Our primary problem is to provide rwx-like volumes to pods on different nodes. I tested with longhorn but performance was suboptimal and I traced the problem back to here. Any suggestion or feedback is also welcome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ogreten"> /u/ogreten </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1huzkwh/strange_interpod_network_performance_compared_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1huzkwh/strange_interpod_network_performance_compared_to/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stockholm University found guilty of discrimination against Turkish student</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1huzh5x/stockholm_university_found_guilty_of/</link><author>/u/turkish__cowboy</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 13:51:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table> <tr><td> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1huzh5x/stockholm_university_found_guilty_of/"> <img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/YJEImQArXGCpYRx1iwO_sgokgJsgNV5gAXUJReGDVyE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e1333a6ae1e4c8256fa30816406f00e26e7e366" alt="Stockholm University found guilty of discrimination against Turkish student" title="Stockholm University found guilty of discrimination against Turkish student" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/turkish__cowboy"> /u/turkish__cowboy </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/world/stockholm-university-found-guilty-of-discrimination-against-turkish-student-101639/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1huzh5x/stockholm_university_found_guilty_of/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flowkeeper - a Pomodoro timer (Python + Qt6), which I develop and test on Linux.

ABSTRACT
In this talk, we'll focus on the challenges of building retrieval augmented generation (RAG) chat applications and how to overcome them efficiently. We'll explore common issues such as file processing, semantic search, and prompt iteration, showing how Elasticsearch helps streamline these tasks. Using Elastic Playground, we'll fine-tune settings and quickly test RAG prompts to optimize performance.

I'll also walk through the process of transforming files into sparse vector embeddings for better search results, and demonstrate how to seamlessly export code for integration into a functional chat application. [...]

Kurakhove, a logistics hub, has held out for months. If Moscow has indeed taken the town, it would enable its forces to step up the pace of their advance in Donetsk. Images showing troops raising a Russian flag have been geolocated by Reuters news agency to Kurakhove. Meanwhile Russia is dealing with a new Ukrainian offensive inside the Kursk region of western Russia.

Biden was speaking Sunday, a day ahead of the fourth anniversary of the storming of the US Capitol building, when then-President Donald Trump's supporters tried to stop the certification of the 2020 election.
As Trump prepares to return to the White House, he has promised to pardon many of the people charged with criminal offenses that day. What could that mean for the defendants, and for democracy?

<p>hi friends!<p>i'm pretty tired of engagement bait and all the political nonsense on my x/twitter feed.<p>i was curious if i could use an llm to filter out these type of content, so i prototyped a quick chrome extension.<p>it uses LLama 3.3 to analyze the tweet through <a href="https://groq.com/" rel="nofollow">https://groq.com/</a> (because they are super-super fast).<p>the extension is available in the chrome store, also there is a link to the repo.<p>- you can tweak the system prompt for the filtering 
- but you need your own API key from Groq (you can get one for free)</p>

Previously I announced <strong>Treds</strong>, but I’ve now <strong>added a fully command-based vector store</strong>, powered by an HNSW graph for approximate nearest-neighbor searches. Here’s a quick look at the four commands:</p> <ol> <li><strong>VCREATE</strong> – Initializes a vector index, specifying parameters like maxNeighbors, layer factor, and efSearch.</li> <li><strong>VINSERT</strong> – Inserts vectors into that index.</li> <li><strong>VSEARCH</strong> – Searches for the k nearest neighbors to a given vector.</li> <li><strong>VDELETE</strong> – Deletes a vector from the index by its ID.</li> </ol> <p>Commands can be executed in redis-cli, as Treds is RESP compliant. A simple session might look like</p> <pre><code>VCREATE vec 6 0.5 100 VINSERT vec 1.0 2.0 VINSERT vec 2.0 3.0 VINSERT vec 3.0 4.0 VSEARCH vec 1.5 2.5 2 </code></pre> <p>This creates an index named <code>vec</code>, inserts some 2D vectors, searches for the 2 nearest neighbors to <code>[1.5, 2.5].</code><strong>Vectors can be N-Dimension as well</strong>.</p> <p>If you checked out Treds before, I’d love to hear your thoughts on the new vector store addition. If you haven’t, feel free to give it a look and let me know if you have any suggestions or questions.

Ukrainian troops have occupied Russian soil since August, when they first advanced into the Kursk area, and have resisted efforts to expel them. Russian media, citing the country's defense ministry, say their troops have so far repelled these latest Ukrainian advances.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Hamas has not provided a list of names. But, a Hamas official earlier told Reuters news agency that the group had approved a list of 34 hostages presented by Israel to be exchanged in a possible ceasefire. Also earlier Israel said indirect negotiations had resumed in Qatar for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.

Despite the talks, Israel has stepped up airstrikes in Gaza, killing dozens of people.

He makes the case for Northeastern to reconsider its decision to move from Racket to Python and Java later this year in an overhaul of its first-year curriculum. 

"Students will get extensive training in Python, which is currently the most requested language by co-op employers," Northeastern explains (some two decades after a Slashdot commenter made the same Hot Languages = Jobs observation in a spirited 2001 debate on Java as a CS introductory language)... 

"I have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a 'useful language' like Python," Kaplan writes. "But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket &mdash; it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends." Also expressing concerns about the selection of suitable languages for novice programming is King's College CS Prof Michael K&#246;lling, who explains, "One of the drivers is the perceived usefulness of the language in a real-world context. Students (and their parents) often have opinions which language is 'better' to learn. In forming these opinions, the definition of 'better' can often be vague and driven by limited insight. One strong aspect commonly cited is the perceived usefulness of a language in the 'real world.' If a language is widely used in industry, it is more likely to be seen as a useful language to learn." K&#246;lling's recommendation? "We need a new language for teaching novices at secondary school and introductory university level," K&#246;lling concludes. "This language should be designed explicitly for teaching [...] Maintenance and adaptation of this language should be driven by pedagogical considerations, not by industry needs." While noble in intent, one suspects Kaplan and K&#246;lling may be on a quixotic quest in a money wins world, outgunned by the demands, resources, and influence of tech giants like Amazon &mdash; the top employer of Northeastern MSCS program grads &mdash; who pushed back against NSF advice to deemphasize Java in high school CS and dropped $15 million to have tech-backed nonprofit Code.org develop and push a new Java-based, powered-by-AWS CS curriculum into high schools with the support of a consortium of politicians, educators, and tech companies. Echoing Northeastern, an Amazon press release argued the new Java-based curriculum "best prepares students for the next step in their education and careers."

The president made the announcement after meeting Chancellor Karl Nehammer - who is resigning following the breakdown of coalition talks between his conservatives and the Social Democrats. Together, the two parties had sought to prevent the far-right Freedom Party - which won the most votes in September's election - from forming a government. 
The breakdown of the talks could pave the way for far-right FPÖ leader Herbert Kickl to come to power, with the conservatives serving as junior partners - despite previous unwillingness to work with the far-right.

He treads the line between people who are deaf, and those who can hear. When he was 15 years old, he fell ill with a rare form of meningitis. He lost his hearing from one day to the next.

A shock for the teenager - and for his parents, too. Thanks to the modern technology of cochlear implants and a lot of training, he can now lead an almost unrestricted life again, as a family man. But everyday life remains exhausting. Now, he campaigns for people who find themselves in situations similar to his own.

 In November the Steam Survey reflected a 2.03% marketshare for Linux... Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. 

 In fact, December "saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey," according to TechSpot &mdash; "up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%..."
Elsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.
Rounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... 

Phoronix adds that the Windows percent "pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

If God exists outside of time—not in time, but timeless and eternal—what would that mean about God’s nature? God would never ‘lose’ the past or anticipate the future. God would not need to know the future, because to a timeless God, there would be no future. Everything would be ever-present in one timeless moment. But how could a timeless God relate to human beings?

Soundwaves: The Symphony of Physics 
Sound is one of the most vivid ways we interact with the underlying science of the universe. A sound can make us laugh, cry or cower in fear, but it can also help us understand our world, how it works and what it's made of. Sound is something we all take for granted, but, in fact, when you hear something you're listening to the sound of pure physics. In this engrossing two-part series Helen Czerski goes on a spectacular journey into the world of sound to discover what it is and what it reveals about the fundamental forces of nature.

With over 3,000 problems, it&#8217;s easy to feel overwhelmed and lost.</p><ul><li><p><strong>How do you even start? </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Which problems should you solve? </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How many problems are enough for coding interviews?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How much time should you spend on each problem?</strong></p></li></ul><p>I will answer these questions and more in this article to make your journey smoother, and lot less less painful.</p><p>For context - I&#8217;ve solved more than 1,500 LeetCode problems and cleared interviews at multiple big tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and in this article I&#8217;ll share everything I&#8217;ve learned to help you start and navigate LeetCode more effectively.</p><p>I&#8217;ll share practical tips and resources to help you save time, stay focused and build your problem-solving skills without feeling overwhelmed.</p><h2>Why do you even need LeetCode?</h2><p>You might be wondering: why is everyone doing LeetCode questions. Is it really necessary to land a Software Engineering job?</p><p>The short answer is: <em>not always</em>.</p><p>There are plenty of startups and smaller companies that focus more on your experience with specific tech stacks and the projects you&#8217;ve built. They might not even include LeetCode style questions in their interview process.</p><p>But if your goal is to work at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, you would need to practice LeetCode style questions since that&#8217;s what they ask in their interviews.</p><h2>Which programming language to choose?</h2><p>This is a question I get asked all the time.</p><p>Many people get stuck at deciding which programming language to use.</p><p>But here&#8217;s the truth: <strong>It doesn&#8217;t really matter.</strong> A programming language is just a tool. Once you understand the approach to solving a problem, you can implement it in any language.</p><p>In my experience giving interviews, unless the job specifically requires expertise in a certain language, you&#8217;ll be fine using any language you&#8217;re comfortable with.</p><p>The point is, LeetCode isn&#8217;t about syntax. It&#8217;s about using the right data structures, algorithms, and your ability to think critically and solve problems.</p><p>That said, if you&#8217;re new to coding, I recommend starting with <strong>Python.</strong> It&#8217;s beginner-friendly and has a simpler syntax.</p><p>If you already know a language&#8212;stick with it. </p><p>Whether it&#8217;s C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go, there&#8217;s no need to switch.</p><p>You don&#8217;t need to be an expert in your chosen language, but you should know the basics like:</p><ul><li><p>variables and data types</p></li><li><p>loops (for and while)</p></li><li><p>if-else conditions</p></li><li><p>arrays and strings</p></li><li><p>functions and classes</p></li><li><p>and input/output operations</p></li></ul><p>Beyond the basics, spend some time learning the <strong>built-in libraries</strong> for common data structures and algorithms.</p><p>These libraries save time and let you focus on solving the problem rather than reimplementing data structures from scratch.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>Python has lists, dictionaries, and sets.</p></li><li><p>Java has ArrayList, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.</p></li><li><p>C++ offers the STL library with vector, map, and set.</p></li></ul><h2>Know the Fundamentals</h2><p>Before diving into LeetCode problems, it&#8217;s good to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

So, how do you decide which ones to solve?</p><p>Start with <strong>easy problems</strong> for each topic. These are perfect for building confidence and understanding the basics of problem-solving.</p><p>Once you&#8217;re comfortable with the easy ones, gradually challenge yourself with slightly harder problems that push you beyond your comfort zone.</p><p>Remember, <strong>real growth happens when you</strong> constantly <strong>challenge yourself.</strong></p><p>Don&#8217;t worry about hard problems in the beginning.</p><p>Most coding interviews focus on <strong>medium-level problems</strong>, so that&#8217;s where you should spend the majority of your time.</p><p>LeetCode also provides curated lists like the <strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-100-liked/">Top 100 Liked Problems</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/">Top Interview 150 Problems</a>.</strong></p><p>These lists are excellent, and I highly recommend solving every problem on them.</p><h2>How many problems should you solve?</h2><p>There&#8217;s no magic number, but from my experience, <strong>300 well-chosen problems</strong> is the sweet spot.</p><p>However, it&#8217;s not about solving just any 300 problems.

Instead of focusing on the quantity of problems you solve, focus on what you learn from each problem.</p><p>It&#8217;s far better to deeply understand and solve 50 problems than to superficially solve 500 problems.</p><p>After solving a problem, ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p><em>Why does this solution work?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What&#8217;s the one key insight that made everything else easier?</em></p></li></ul><p>Also, try to make it fun. There is a fun in learning to solve coding challenges. It&#8217;s not just about getting a job.</p><h2>Focus on learning Patterns</h2><p>The key to getting better at LeetCode is learning<strong> </strong>as many<strong> </strong>patterns as possible.</p><p>Instead of focusing on individual questions, focus on identifying <strong>underlying patterns</strong> that connect similar problems.</p><p>On LeetCode, you&#8217;ll come across multiple problems that follow a similar patterns. Once you solve one of them, you can apply the same approach to solve others.</p><p>For example: After learning the monotonic stack <strong>pattern</strong>, I was able to solve over 10 similar problems.</p><p>I made a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjYZk8nrXVY">video</a></strong> covering the 15 <strong>most important LeetCode patterns</strong> I learned after solving over 1,500 problems. You can check it out later.</p><p>On <strong><a href="http://algomaster.io">algomaster.io</a></strong>, I&#8217;ve categorized problems by pattern. This makes it easy to focus on one pattern at a time. By going through the list, you will get to know all the important patterns for coding interviews.</p><h2>How to approach a new problem?</h2><h4><strong>1. Read the Problem Statement Twice</strong></h4><p>The first time, focus on getting the big picture. What is the problem asking you to do?</p><p>On the second read, pay attention to specific constraints and conditions. These small details often provide clues for optimizing your solution.</p><h4><strong>2. Analyze the Input and Output Examples</strong></h4><p>Carefully go through the examples provided in the problem.</p><p>Walk through the input and output step by step to understand how the problem works. I have found that, many times simply walking through a few examples helped me figure out the solution.</p><h4><strong>3. Visualize with pen and paper</strong></h4><p>Many problems specially the ones related to trees and graphs are much easier to understand when you draw them out.</p><p>Try to take examples that cover different scenarios and input sizes. Think about any <strong>edge cases</strong> that might come up.</p><h4><strong>4. Start with a Brute Force Approach</strong></h4><p>Don&#8217;t expect to come up with the most optimal solution right away.</p><p>First see, if you can solve the problems using a brute force approach. While it might not be efficient, it gives you a baseline to improve upon.</p><h4><strong>5. Optimize Your Solution</strong></h4><p>Once you have a brute force solution, focus on optimizing it.</p><p>Here are few things to consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Leverage Unused Information</strong>: Look for details you might have missed. For instance, if the problem states that the array is sorted, consider leveraging this to use binary search or a two-pointer approach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Precompute Information</strong>: If certain calculations are repeated multiple times, consider precomputing them. Use techniques like <strong>prefix sums</strong> or <strong>frequency counts</strong> to avoid redundant calculations. Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Time vs. Space Tradeoffs:</strong> Sometimes, using additional memory (e.g., hash tables) can speed up your solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Structure Brainstorm:</strong> Run through the popular data structures and try to apply each one to the problem at hand.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>6. Keep it Simple</strong></h4><p>Avoid overcomplicating your solution. At every stage ask yourself, <em><strong>"Is there a simpler way to do this?"</strong></em>. This will not only make your solution easier to understand but it will also reduce the chances of errors during coding.</p><h4><strong>7. Analyze Time and Space Complexity</strong></h4><p>Develop the habit of analyzing the time and space complexity of every problem you submit.</p><h2>How much time should you spend on each problem?</h2><p>When you&#8217;re just starting out, even <strong>easy problems</strong> can take a while to solve. That&#8217;s completely normal&#8212;don&#8217;t get discouraged if you can&#8217;t come up with a solution right away.</p><p>Your main goal in the beginning should be to <strong>focus on learning</strong> and understanding the problem deeply. Real progress happens when you take the time to think, make mistakes and refine your approach.</p><p>But, some problems involve specific tricks or patterns that are hard to figure out unless you&#8217;ve seen them before.</p><p>Spending hours on such problems without progress can be counterproductive.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a good rule of thumb:</p><ul><li><p>Give yourself <strong>30 to 60 minutes</strong> of focused effort for each problem.</p></li><li><p>If you&#8217;re still stuck, it&#8217;s okay to look at hints or solutions.</p></li></ul><p>Read the official solution and and try to understand the top voted solutions on LeetCode discussion forum.</p><p>Don&#8217;t just move on after viewing the solution. Try to grasp why the solution works.</p><p>Rewrite the solution from scratch without looking at the code. Writing it yourself helps you internalize the approach and ensures you truly understand it.</p><p>If you couldn&#8217;t solve the problem on your first attempt, mark it for <strong>revision</strong> and revisit it after a few weeks. Revisiting problems helps reinforce your understanding and ensures long-term retention.</p><h2><strong>Avoid Memorization</strong></h2><p>One of the most common mistakes&#8212;one that I made myself&#8212;is <strong>memorizing solutions</strong> to difficult problems and moving on.</p><p>At first, it might seem like a shortcut, but in reality, it&#8217;s a <strong>big mistake</strong> for three main reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>You&#8217;ll quickly forget memorized solutions.</strong> Without understanding the logic behind them, they won&#8217;t stick in your memory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your problem-solving skills won&#8217;t improve.</strong> Memorization skips the critical thinking process, which is the real value of practicing coding problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>You&#8217;ll struggle in interviews.</strong> Most interviewers ask variants of problems or follow-up questions, and without a deep understanding, you won&#8217;t be able to adapt.</p></li></ol><p>Instead of memorizing, focus on understanding the solution, even if it takes hours.</p><p>Break it down step by step and ask yourself:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Why does this approach work?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>What&#8217;s the key insight that simplifies the problem?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How can I apply this approach to similar problems?</strong></p></li></ul><p>This effort pays off in the long term. The deeper your understanding, the more confident you&#8217;ll feel explaining your thought process during interviews.</p><h2>Practice in a timed environment</h2><p>Solving a problem during an interview is very different from solving it from the comfort of your home.</p><p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a good idea to time-box yourself and practice in a timed environment after you have learned the basics and solved 100-150 problems.</p><p>Simply turn on a timer while practicing and try to complete the problem within that time.</p><ul><li><p>For <strong>easy problems</strong>, aim to complete them in <strong>10-15 minutes.</strong></p></li><li><p>For <strong>medium problems</strong>, set a timer for <strong>up to 30 minutes.</strong></p></li><li><p>For <strong>hard problems</strong>, allow yourself <strong>up to an hour.</strong></p></li></ul><p>To take your practice a step further:</p><ul><li><p>Participate in <strong><a href="https://leetcode.com/contest/">LeetCode contests</a></strong>.</p></li><li><p>Try <strong>virtual contests</strong> by simulating past LeetCode contests.</p></li></ul><p>It&#8217;s okay if you struggle to solve even one problem initially&#8212;this is normal. The goal is to gain experience solving problems within a time limit.</p><p>When I started participating in contests, I could only solve 1-2 problems.

But little attention is paid to it by the media and the international community. Estimates put the number of victims in the millions, with no end in sight.

All parties in the conflict seem to be trapped in a spiral of violence. The disputes are over power, money and access to the country’s valuable natural resources.

Belgian film director Thierry Michel has been travelling throughout the Congo with his camera for over 30 years. He has witnessed the struggles and suffering, but also the hopes of the Congolese people. In the film, the speech by doctor and Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege outlines the story of the relentless violence that has devastated and destroyed the Congo for so long.

None of the actors in this drama are spared in this uncompromising film - from Congolese rulers, to neighboring countries, to international institutions. The film draws on the UN Mapping Report, which records the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Congo between March 1993 and June 2003. The report names the perpetrators, which caused unease and was kept secret.

The film paints a contrasting picture of a country caught between outrage and solidarity. It speaks out in favor of coming to terms with history, and against forgetting. The film aims to play a role in setting the record straight. After decades of impunity, the film shows, those responsible for crimes must be brought to justice.

Using techniques developed over 2,500 years ago, the team takes on the ultimate challenge of recreating a sarcophagus. Can modern hands replicate ancient ingenuity?

Taken from 'Building the Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

What is the farthest extent of the physical world, not only cosmologically across the universe but also conceptually across laws of nature? Can there be radical new discoveries in the 21st century as relativity and quantum mechanics were in the 20th century? Some speculate that a true understanding of consciousness will require laws as yet unknown.

<p>Hi,<p>As an enthusiast chess player, I like to manage my games and my opening repertoire as a set of PGN files stored in a Git repository (PGN is a text file format for recording chess games). So I wanted a way to pretty-print PGN files using a CLI and integrating in my editor.<p>Today, it looks like most people use GUI-based software. So I decided to create a Prettier plugin that formats PGN files. Prettier is a well-known pretty-printer in the Node.js ecosystem, used to ensure consistent source code formatting in software projects. One upside of implementing this PGN formatter as a Prettier plugin is that it benefits from its editor integration.<p>The plugin is currently near complete, even if the project is still at an early stage. It's usable, even if there might be some bugs.<p>Hope you find this useful. Comments and ideas are welcome. Have a nice weekend.</p>

ABSTRACT
There is a paradox in the foundations of computing. On the one hand, lambda calculus is supposed to compute anything that can be computed. On the other hand, many intensional computations, such as deciding equality of programs (terms in closed normal form), are not definable within lambda calculus. The paradox has now been resolved by close reading of the original papers and books, which clarifies that lambda calculus is inherently extensional.

More importantly, there are new, intensional calculi which are more expressive than lambda calculus. First, pattern calculus supports both higher-order functions and generic queries of data structures, by basing all computation on pattern matching. Second, SF-calculus can query programs as well as data structures by factoring them, using the operator F. In particular, the Goedel number of a program can be defined within the calculus itself.Third, lambda-SF calculus adds native support for lambda-abstraction to SF-calculus. Other calculi are currently under development.

Pattern calculus has been realised in the programming language, bondi. Even better programming languages are now possible.

<p>The difference in cost between products that are developed as accessibility tools compared to consumer products is huge. One example is camera glasses where the accessibility product costs ~$3000 (Envision Glasses), and the consumer product costs ~$300 (Ray-Ban Meta).<p>In this case the Ray-Ban Meta is getting accessibility features. The functionality is promising according to reviews, but requires the user to say "Hey meta what am I looking at" every time a scene is to be described. The battery life seem underwhelming as well.<p>It would be nice to have an cheap and open source alternative to the currently available products, where the user gets fed information rather than continuously requesting it. This is where I got interested to see if I could create a solution using an ESP32 WiFi camera, and learn some arduino development in the process.<p>I managed to create a solution where the camera connects to the phone "personal hotspot", and publishes an image every 7 seconds to an online server, which then uses the gpt-4o-mini model to describe the image and update a web page, that is read back to the user using voice synthesis. The latency for this is less than 2 seconds, and is generally faster.<p>I am happy with the result and learnt a lot, but I think I will pause this project for now. At least until some shiny new tech emerges (cheaper open source camera glasses).</p>

Meshery makes infrastructure and application management less about finger-pointing and more about collaborating.

Engineering teams all too often find themselves siloed, using disparate tooling, inconsistent workflow, and have a lack of collaboration and shared process. By facilitating shared workspaces, a catalog of cloud native patterns, and a multi-player experience, Meshery empowers teams to work together effectively, streamlining infrastructure design and operational management.

<p>I've been building prototypes of new AI learning tools for months, but I recently learned that 3blue1brown open sourced his incredible math animation library, Manim, and that LLMs could generate code for it without any fine-tuning.<p>So I made a tool that automatically generates animated math/science explanations in the style of 3blue1brown using Manim from any text prompt.<p>Try it yourself at <a href="https://TMA.live" rel="nofollow">https://TMA.live</a> (no signup required)<p>or see the demo video here: <a href="https://x.com/i/status/1874948287759081608" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/i/status/1874948287759081608</a><p>The UX is pretty simple right now, you just write a text prompt and then start watching the video as it's generated.

Dynamic Management of X509 Certificates Using Kubernetes Certificate Operator - Abhidnya Joshi & Senthil Ponnuswamy, Dell Technologies

Security is non-negotiable area and Kubernetes based environments are no exception! Usage of x509 certificates is the key thing. Be it K8s deployments in private or public cloud, ensuring availability of "right" X509 certificate for a service is very important. If this service is getting connected from external (apps/clients which are outside of K8s cluster) clients, this is even more important! But what is really the "right" x509 certificate and how can we ensure that is always remains "right"? Can we make corrections dynamically? Can we also ensure easy propagation of certificates imported from outside the cluster? Propagation of Certificate revocation lists to ensure services can deny revoked certificates?

This talk helps describe the strategy K8s based products can use to dynamically generate, make correction and propagation of X509 certificates within K8s cluster using K8s operator design pattern and makes use of well-known CNCF projects such as cert-manager and trust-manager.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An Astrophysicists&apos; Party Trick! 📄 How to Walk Through Paper</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjV5q-vsFWM</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 3 Jan 2025 21:51:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

To search for meaning, God or something like God is often involved. But this need not be so. How can meaning be found, or purpose realized, without invoking supernatural forces? Scientists and philosophers who do not believe in God search for ‘meaning’ in what seems to be a meaningless cosmos. They do generate a kind of ‘meaning’. Are they fooling themselves?

// Abstract
Lloyds Banking Group is on a mission to embrace the power of cloud and unlock the opportunities that it provides. Andrew, Michelle, and their MLOps team have been on a journey over the last 12 months to take their portfolio of circa 10 Machine Learning models in production and migrate them from an on-prem solution to a cloud-based environment. During the podcast, Michelle and Andrew share their reflections as well as some dos (and don’ts!) of managing the migration of an established portfolio.

// Bio
Michelle Marie Conway
Michelle is a Lead Data Scientist in the high-performance data science team at Lloyds Banking Group. With deep expertise in managing production-level Python code and machine learning models, she has worked alongside fellow senior manager Andrew to drive the bank's transition to the Google Cloud Platform. Together, they have played a pivotal role in modernising the ML portfolio in collaboration with a remarkable ML Ops team.

Originally from Ireland and now based in London, Michelle blends her technical expertise with a love for the arts. 

Andrew Baker
Andrew graduated from the University of Birmingham with a first-class honours degree in Mathematics and Music with a Year in Computer Science and joined Lloyds Banking Group on their Retail graduate scheme in 2015.

Since 2021 Andrew has worked in the world of data, firstly in shaping the Retail data strategy and most recently as a Data Science Delivery Lead, growing and managing a team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers. He has built a high-performing team responsible for building and maintaining ML models in production for the Consumer Lending division of the bank.

Andrew is motivated by the role that data science and ML can play in transforming the business and its processes, and is focused on balancing the power of ML with the need for simplicity and explainability that enables business users to engage with the opportunities that exist in this space and the demands of a highly regulated environment.

They consist mainly of deciduous trees. One tree has a very special role to play: the oak.

For the Celts, the oak symbolised the connection between the spirits of heaven and earth. In fact, the tree is perfectly adapted to the changing seasons: In autumn it loses its leaves, in winter it rests under a blanket of snow and in spring it begins to sprout anew. Its fruits are a tasty treat for wood mice, wild boar, squirrels and jays, all of which help to spread the oak seeds. High in the branches, green woodpeckers and bats thank the tree for its hospitality by ridding it of the parasites that prey on its wood and leaves.

The shy lynx also serves the oak well, defending it from the deer and ibex that love to nibble on its shoots. Beneath the ground, the oak lives in symbiosis with fungi, which provide it with vital nutrients. Ecologists, biologists and fungal researchers explain the connections between these fascinating interactions. The secret of the success of the highly resilient temperate forests lies in their biodiversity. Unfortunately, they are increasingly being replaced by pure conifer plantations, which meet the demands of the highly standardized timber industry but deplete the soil, causing numerous species to migrate. In view of industrial timber construction practices and the expansion of urban centers, the question arises: is the oak really as immortal as people claim?

Gladiators often came from these newly conquered places and with them brought new battle techniques and culture.

The technique, detailed in a new paper, requires programmers to use a restricted version of C called "Mini-C" that excludes features like pointer arithmetic. The researchers successfully tested their conversion system on two major code libraries, including the 80,000-line HACL* cryptographic library. Parts of the converted code have already been integrated into Mozilla's NSS and OpenSSH security systems, according to the researchers. Memory safety errors account for 76% of Android vulnerabilities in 2019.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Amid this flurry of chaos, there exists an age-old profession - midwifery. You’d think helping parents bring their children into this world would be considered a noble pursuit. But being a midwife has never been simple. They were lauded as heroes in one century, persecuted as witches in the next, and are still given the occasional side-eye today.

But this time a narrower majority and a hollowed-out center might mean the Trumpiest Congress ever might fail to deliver his agenda. Republicans and Democrats have each retreated more into their own camps, making the possibility for dealmaking even more narrow. 

WSJ explores why Trump may have a difficult time getting funding for his different policies like his immigration and deportation plans and his tax cuts.

ABSTRACT
Consulting group McKinsey & Company have recently published an article called “Yes you can measure software developer productivity” which has been widely criticised. Grady Booth said “It’s rubbish”, Kent Back said “The report is so absurd and naive that it makes no sense to critique it in detail” and Daniel Terhorst-North said, “Don’t try to measure the individual contribution of a unit in a complex adaptive system, because the premise of the question is flawed”.

In this episode software engineer and author, Dave Farley joins in with the critique, and while agreeing with Kent Beck on most things, does look at the report in some detail to critique it. He finds that the McKinsey developer productivity article is as useless and ill-informed as the reactions of many other industry experts would suggest.

<p>Hi, I'm a developer and first time i shipped the real product after observing the startups and indie hackers community for years.<p>I had made so many useless apps [you should check my website <a href="https://ansh.life" rel="nofollow">https://ansh.life</a>], but this time I built a very useful product that has a number of super easy-to-use tools in one app for video, music, and photo files. Users can compress, convert, resize, and do so much more with easy-to-use tools.<p>Background: I developed a frame-by-frame video cropper to upload cropped landscape videos to Instagram Reels. However, it required FFmpeg, and as a noob video editor, I decided to incorporate more user-friendly video tools. I then introduced image and audio tools to maximize the capabilities of FFmpeg. I use my app daily, and it has surprisingly generated a few thousand dollars for me.</p>

              <p>As many of us celebrated the year-end holidays, a small group of researchers worked overtime tracking a startling discovery: At least 33 browser extensions hosted in Google’s Chrome Web Store, some for as long as 18 months, were surreptitiously siphoning sensitive data from roughly 2.6 million devices.</p>
<p>The compromises came to light with the <a href="https://www.vulnu.com/p/breaking-cyberhaven-chrome-extension-compromised">discovery</a> by data loss prevention service Cyberhaven that a Chrome extension used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227171802/https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cyberhaven-security-exten/pajkjnmeojmbapicmbpliphjmcekeaac">400,000</a> of its customers had been updated with code that stole their sensitive data.</p>
<h2>’Twas the night before Christmas</h2>
<p>The malicious extension, available as version 24.10.4, was available for 31 hours, from December 25 at 1:32 AM UTC to Dec 26 at 2:50 AM UTC. Chrome browsers actively running Cyberhaven during that window would automatically download and install the malicious code. Cyberhaven responded by issuing version 24.10.5, and 24.10.6 a few days later.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/dozens-of-backdoored-chrome-extensions-discovered-on-2-6-million-devices/">Read full article</a></p>

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law and Diana Montalion explore the critical importance of systems thinking in software development and organizational dynamics. Diana Montalion touches on her new book, "Learning Systems Thinking," highlighting how traditional linear approaches to problem-solving often fall short in today's complex environments. She emphasizes that effective systems leadership requires not only recognizing the interconnectedness of various components but also fostering collaborative thinking and decision-making among teams.

By engaging in practices that enhance understanding and adaptability, organizations can better navigate challenges and drive meaningful change, moving beyond simplistic solutions to embrace a more holistic view of their systems.

Now it faces a new threat: tens of millions of mostly young workers who refuse to pay into it.

Humphrey, a 24-year-old tango instructor, and Gao Peng Cheng, a 22-year-old content creator, are among them. They say they’re pessimistic about China’s economic future and that their money could be put to better use. 

Yet, China’s pension system needs that money. More than 20 million Chinese are expected to retire each year over the next decade. And most will be eligible to receive some sort of retirement benefit. 

It’s part of the reason why, on Jan. 1, President Xi Jinping’s government officially raised the country’s retirement age for the first time in more than 40 years.

As always he is joined by Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson who talks him through the history of all the pistols, rifles and machine guns employed in the conflict.

First up is the Webley Revolver Mk VI, first introduced during the stalemate of static and bloody trench warfare in 1915. Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley’s returning to front line service in the conflict.

Second is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.

Third up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.

Last but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren’s box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition.

--

For years, Jean Béliveau walked from country to country, with the goal of circumnavigating the globe on foot. While few people have the time or desire to walk such extreme lengths, research shows that adding even a modest amount of walking to your daily routine can dramatically improve your health. So, what exactly happens to your body when you increase your step count? Shannon Odell investigates.

We human beings sit roughly midway between the sizes of atoms and galaxies, and both must be so perfectly structured for us to exist. It’s called ‘fine-tuning’ and it’s all so breathtakingly precise that it cries out for explanation. To some, fine-tuning leads to God. To others, there are non-supernatural explanations. Both are startling.

The mission put a man on the moon for the very first time, winning the Space Race for the United States.  

The rocket that made it possible was Saturn V. As tall as a 36-story building, it was the most powerful that had ever flown, symbolising American technological dominance during the Cold War. 

And yet, the man who designed it had a dark past. During the Second World War, he had been at the forefront of the Nazi Secret Weapons programme, designing weapons which cost thousands of lives. His name was Werner von Braun.

*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film “The woman in the moon” (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film (used for illustrative purposes in the video) was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it’s technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work.

Nearly 13 million tourists went on Caribbean cruises in 2013, but there are only so many ports they can visit. Because of increasingly large crowds in places like Nassau, new destinations like Ocean Cay in the Bahamas have become increasingly important. 

WSJ explores how MSC spent $500 million transforming a dredging site into an exclusive destination for its passengers.

there is space, it is stored directly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Hit:</strong> If the requested item exists in the cache, it is served, and no changes are made to the cache.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cache Miss:</strong> If the item is not in the cache and the cache is full, a random item is removed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Eviction</strong>: The randomly selected item is removed, and the new item is added to the cache.</p></li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:</p><ol><li><p>Add <strong>A</strong> &#8594; Cache: [A]</p></li><li><p>Add <strong>B</strong> &#8594; Cache: [A, B]</p></li><li><p>Add <strong>C</strong> &#8594; Cache: [A, B, C]</p></li><li><p>Add <strong>D</strong> &#8594; Cache: [B, C, D] (A is randomly evicted).</p></li><li><p>Add <strong>E</strong> &#8594; Cache: [C, E, D] (B is randomly evicted).</p></li></ol><h4><strong>Pros</strong>:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Simple to Implement</strong>: No need for metadata like access frequency or recency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low Overhead</strong>: Computational and memory requirements are minimal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fair for Unpredictable Access Patterns</strong>: Avoids bias toward recency or frequency, which can be useful in some scenarios.</p></li></ol><h4><strong>Cons</strong>:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Unpredictable Eviction</strong>: A frequently used item might be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inefficient for Stable Access Patterns</strong>: Doesn&#8217;t adapt well when certain items are consistently accessed.</p></li><li><p><strong>High Risk of Poor Cache Hit Rates</strong>: Random eviction often leads to suboptimal retention of important items.</p></li></ol><h2>5. Most Recently Used (MRU)</h2><p><strong>MRU</strong> is the opposite of <strong>Least Recently Used (LRU)</strong>. In MRU, the item that was accessed most recently is the first to be evicted when the cache is full.</p><p>The idea behind MRU is that the most recently accessed item is likely to be a temporary need and won&#8217;t be accessed again soon, so evicting it frees up space for potentially more valuable data.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img"

<p>Teardown is a 2022 sandbox puzzle game developed and published by Tuxedo Labs. The game revolves around the owner of a financially stricken demolition company, who is caught undertaking a questionable job and becomes entangled between helping police investigations and taking on further dubious assignments.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>The game stands out for its technical achievements, particularly its use of voxel-based rendering, which enables highly interactive and fully destructible environments. <a href="https://x.com/voxagonlabs">Dennis Gustafsson</a> is the Founder of <a href="https://tuxedolabs.com/">TuxedoLabs</a> and the creator of Teardown, among other games. In today&#8217;s episode, Dennis speaks with Joe Nash about his 20-year history in game development, his passion for physics in games, Teardown, the advantage of using voxels, and much more.</p>

Everyone has beliefs—some are simple and basic (e.g., my name, age), others complex and controversial (e.g., God? Soul? Politics? Morality?). But what is the concept of ‘belief’? What does it take for some statement to be a ‘belief’? And what distinguishes among ‘belief’, ‘true belief’, and ‘knowledge’? Before asking what we believe, let’s understand ‘belief’.

Researchers who interpret early warning signs predict an eruption. A huge magma chamber lies dormant beneath the Earth's crust. An eruption would have catastrophic consequences.

If an eruption does occur, it’ll be a race against time. So, with the help of modern measuring techniques, researchers are seeking to identify early warning signs. If they can better understand the processes taking place inside the Earth, it’ll help them predict an eruption. This, in turn, would allow affected areas to be evacuated in time. 

In the past 2.1 million years, the Yellowstone Supervolcano has erupted three times - most recently, some 600,000 years ago. The next eruption could be due soon.

The fine-tuning of the constants of nature, which seems required for the existence of stars and planets and certainly for life and mind, is a fascinating feature of our universe. But before grand metaphysical schemes are advanced by philosophers, theologians, and even scientists, proper understanding of the underlying assumptions and fundamental physics are needed.

Watson, a renowned psychologist, and Rosalie Rayner, his assistant and eventual wife, decided to combine love, science, and a fair bit of cluelessness in an experiment that would go down in history as “The Little Albert Experiment.” The idea was bold, the execution debatable, and the results as ethically murky as a midsummer mud puddle. Thus, in a story one might mistake for the beginning of a Dickensian epic, Little Albert’s fate was sealed.

<p>When automating business processes at work, I found it difficult and time-consuming to reverse engineer business systems' APIs. I often had to manually reverse engineer APIs using developer tools or settle for less optimal technologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA).<p>Often, the issue is that it can be hard to resolve all the cookies, access tokens, and other elements required to successfully execute the requests. Manually trying to resolve these dependencies using developer tools is especially challenging with multiple requests where data is stored in JavaScript objects or HTML elements.<p>To try to solve this issue, I built a tool called API Parrot that automatically identifies the data correlations between requests and builds a graphical representation of the flow to give users a better understanding. To streamline the process, I also included functionality to record requests, define your own inputs and outputs, and export the entire flow—or parts of it—as JavaScript code.<p>The application is Electron-based and currently compiled for Windows and Linux. Please try it out and give feedback!<p>Online Tutorial: A simple example of reverse engineering the USPS API is available at <a href="https://docs.apiparrot.com/docs/category/tutorial---reverse-engineering-the-usps-api" rel="nofollow">https://docs.apiparrot.com/docs/category/tutorial---reverse-...</a></p>

<p>I have never written an annual report on my work before, but since I also spend time on open source projects, I decided to write one (maybe it will become a tradition).</p>
<h2 id="programming-languages-and-tools"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#programming-languages-and-tools" aria-label="Anchor link for: programming-languages-and-tools">Programming Languages and Tools</a></h2>
<h3 id="rust"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#rust" aria-label="Anchor link for: rust">Rust</a></h3>
<p>The main change in my work was the active use of Rust in the second half of the past year. I mainly write in Rust where I used to write in Go. Overall, the language is more complex than Go and sometimes confusing with the borrow checker, but in general, it is quite convenient to write – I can't say that the speed of writing code significantly decreases compared to other languages – in general, the approaches that need to be used are roughly the same for all languages.</p>
<p>What I like about Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>crates ecosystem – many libraries available and can be installed in one command</li>
<li>single binary file and low memory consumption</li>
<li>ability to write applications of various directions (web-app, tui, gui, parsers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>What I don't like about Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow Docker image builds (<a href="/fast-multi-arch-docker-for-rust">my solution</a>)</li>
<li>a large number of sub-dependencies for web projects (any project on axum will contain 200+ dependencies)</li>
<li>use of C-binding in "core" libraries like rust-tls (ring) – complicates cross-compilation because you have to maintain a C toolchain as well (fixed through Zig build, but it looks monstrous)</li>
<li>lack of finished solutions for serde (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2254">default values</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/serde-how-to-parse-json-partially-7-years-later/97030">partial initialization</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's nice to write various parsers in Rust, and then they can be coolly parallelized (with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/">rayon</a> or <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/fs/index.html">tokio</a>), in Go I had a problems with this due to immutable strings and lack of GC control.</p>
<h3 id="main-languages"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#main-languages" aria-label="Anchor link for: main-languages">Main languages</a></h3>
<p>The main languages remained the same: Python, NodeJS/TypeScript. I also actively used NextJS on several projects, overall I was satisfied – it's faster and easier to write frontends, but it's quite difficult to find problem's solutions sometimes (many Github issues, often they are open, and the comments contain answers that no longer work).</p>
<p>The main fail of the year in the NodeJS ecosystem is the update of ESLint from 8 -&gt; 9 – completely incompatible API with all existing plugins, the configuration file became larger and more complex – it's not clear why the authors made this diversion. I also tried <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://biomejs.dev">Binome</a> as an alternative to ESLint / Prettier, but it's completely different and you need to redo a lot, and not everything you need is available at the moment, I continue to monitor this project.</p>
<p>I also tried Zig, but didn't write anything serious. Personally, I didn't understand why this language is needed. At the time I tried it, there was no even package manager yet. Obviously Zig is a competitor to C (not Rust), but C is now much richer in its toolkit and support in other languages. The only thing I can point out is <code>zig build</code> which can build C projects too and does it with less problems.</p>
<h3 id="about-llm"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#about-llm" aria-label="Anchor link for: about-llm">About LLM</a></h3>
<p>I want to separately note about use of GPTs in work. I have an opportunity to do business tasks in the format of parsing and analyzing texts. What a couple of years ago was done with a bunch of regex, etc., can now be done through GPT and it works great! I tried using local Llama2, but it would have taken weeks to process my data on M2 chip. I redo the solution to use ChatGPT API and processed the data in a couple of days. It's good that all LLMs support openai-client API in Python, so the code almost didn't need to be rewritten. Among the disadvantages of LLama-like aka local running, I also want to note the lack of support for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling">Function calling</a> (to guarantee to bring the LLM response to the desired structure, in my case). The last time I did something serious was more than six months ago, maybe a lot has changed. I also tested gemma2, the inference speed was impressive, and the quality of the answers was not much worse.</p>
<p>As local runners, I used <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> and <a href="https://vnotes.pages.dev/2024-in-review/mlx_ml">https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx</a> – the second one uses Mac resources better (checked through <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/macmon">macmon</a>), but new models come out a bit slower on it. Some people use <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">ollama</a>, but I didn't understand why, considering that it has an incompatible client with openai-client API and slower performance.</p>
<h2 id="blog"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#blog" aria-label="Anchor link for: blog">Blog</a></h2>
<p>Initially, I ran my blog only on Medium, but it's not comfortable to write text there – it's much easier to write and edit in the same editor where I write code (plus my editor has Copilot). Therefore, I decided to move my blog to a static page generator. As an engine, I chose <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> (Rust-based, simple, and fast); I also tried <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>, but it's too big and complex for such a simple task. Overall, Zola is good, but it lacks some filters in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/">templating</a>, not enough flexibility in file structure, and not all popular languages are supported in code highlighting.</p>
<p>I left Medium as a fallback for old readers. I also made a cross-post on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://dev.to/vladkens">dev.to</a>, but there are very few views. Medium is disappointed with the lack of the ability to automate cross-posting (they have a deprecated API, but it does not support updating articles and code highlights). Most likely, it's possible to reverse engineer how they save articles through their editor (changes are sent as diffs). Does anyone else need this besides me?</p>
<h2 id="new-projects"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#new-projects" aria-label="Anchor link for: new-projects">New projects</a></h2>
<p>Last year I launched several new projects (in chronological order):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/timewiz">timewiz.cc</a> (<code>react</code>, <code>webapp</code>) – a tool to find common working hours for distributed teams (an alternative to worldtimebuddy.com, I don't remember exactly why I made my own version). Score: fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/ecloop">ecloop</a> (<code>c</code>, <code>cli</code>) – secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation for Apple chips. Mainly an educational project to understand cryptography, SIMD optimizations, etc. Added several standard use cases for finding Bitcoin keys by brute force, but mathematically this is pointless, so as I said earlier, this is more of an interesting educational project (and I wanted to publish a series of articles on cryptography, but didn't have time last year, I hope to do it this year). Some people use this project in hopes of finding something. I also had ideas to add Metal API support – but that takes a lot of time, so I switched to other projects. Score: okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/macmon">macmon</a> (<code>rust</code>, <code>tui</code>) – TUI program for monitoring MacOS performance (CPU/GPU/ANE usage, RAM, temps). My first public Rust project, a lot of reverse engineering of how <a href="/powermetrics-macos">powermetrics in MacOS</a> works, C-bindings. The project is used both by users in TUI mode and by other projects in headless mode (JSON metrics). Score: success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/ghstats">ghstats</a> (<code>rust</code>, <code>axum</code>, <code>htmx</code>, <code>webapp</code>) – a small self-hosted service that collects and saves GitHub repo statistics, has several built-in views and an API to retrieve all statistics. The project started well, but then kind of fizzled out in terms of issues and feature requests, most likely users are satisfied with the current functionality. I would like to add more visualizations, but I haven't had time for that yet. The main thing for now is that the statistics are collected and saved, so something can be done with this in the future. Technically, I like that the service consumes only 10 MB of RAM. Score: okay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/ogp">ogp</a> (<code>rust</code>, <code>axum</code>, <code>api-service</code>) – a small project for generating <a href="/og-image-generator">OGP articles preview</a> as a service. Used in this blog (you can check by sending this article to your friends in a messenger or social network 😀). Worked with the SVG standard (I thought it was more adequate) and generating PNG from SVG. Score: more of fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/compose-updater">compose-updater</a> (<code>python</code>, <code>api-service</code>) – a project for updating the version of a docker image from CI in a closed infrastructure. I didn't find anything ready to solve this task. There is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower">watchtower</a>, but it's more about keeping up-to-date docker images, rather than updating a specific one, and also I couldn't run it with ECR repos – the author made a super minimalist image in which I couldn't enter through <code>sh</code> to debug. The second alternative is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/umputun/updater">umputun/updater</a>, but it's more about running different shell commands through a webhook. I chose Python because I didn't find a Rust crate for Docker API (most likely it exists, I just didn't understand which one is really good). Score: – (I didn't promote the project anywhere, I use it for my own purposes for now).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="existing-projects"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#existing-projects" aria-label="Anchor link for: existing-projects">Existing projects</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/twscrape">twscrape</a> (<code>python</code>, <code>lib</code>) – a library <a href="/twscrape">for parsing</a> data from X/Twitter. Mainly the project is in maintenance mode, I check its functionality every few months, and there have been no requests for new features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/apigen-ts">apigen-ts</a> (<code>typescript</code>, <code>lib</code>) – a library <a href="/simple-typescript-api-client-generator">for generating</a> TypeScript client OpenAPI spec. I continue to use it in my projects; I also see that there are a small number of other users. My relevance has slightly decreased due to the NextJS/TRPC stack, but in other configurations (e.g. FastApi + React), it is still relevant, so use it. Periodically there are requests to fix something or add a feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="abandoned-projects"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#abandoned-projects" aria-label="Anchor link for: abandoned-projects">Abandoned projects</a></h2>
<p>I also have several projects that I didn't finish and abandoned. I'll write about them here, maybe someone needs something from this, then I can return to on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>anypost</code> – cross-posting between static blog, Medium, Dev.to, Substack, and collecting joined article statistics. I abandoned the project due to the lack of an API at Medium – the only solution I found was through protocol reverse and session cookie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bcloop</code> – a program to walk Bitcoin-like blockchain and compile the final UTXO list. I abandoned it because I couldn't figure out how to effectively create a HashMap-like structure with external memory support to run on computers with small RAM (less than 32GB, LOL).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tg-watcher</code> – a program that listens to all incoming messages in Telegram (chats &amp; channels) and saves their history in a separate database with the ability to search through these messages later. I have the first version that just saves messages in json files, but I didn't develop the idea further.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="devices"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#devices" aria-label="Anchor link for: devices">Devices</a></h2>
<p>I'm not a big tech geek, but I want to say about a few devices which made my life easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://store.mele.cn/products/mele-quieter-4c-n100-3-4ghz-fanless-mini-computer-lpddr4x-win11-hdmi-4k-wi-fi-5-bt-5-1-usb-3-2-2-usb-2-0-1-type-c-1?variant=43958369648818">MeLE Fanless Quieter 4C</a> – a small fanless PC for <em>homelab</em>, I use it as a native Linux via SSH for testing various programs and keep some cron jobs on it for data collection. It's cool that it's silent because it has no fan, but it heats up a lot under load. The performance of the N100 chip surprised me – only 2x slower than M2 chip (tested with <code>ecloop bench</code>, single core).</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://promate.net/products/hdmi-pd100">Promate HDMI-PD100</a> – nice cable format to connect a monitor and my Mac. One cable is needed to charge and transmit the video stream. Before that, I used hubs, but it's a big block. I'm glad I see fewer wires.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="at-glance"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#at-glance" aria-label="Anchor link for: at-glance">At Glance</a></h2>
<p>Over the year, 8 articles were published, totaling 9039 words (~45 minutes to read), and gained 5203 views. Top 3 articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/htmx-table-sorting">Table sorting and pagination with HTMX</a> – 1714 views</li>
<li><a href="/macmon">macmon – Mac Usage Monitor in Terminal</a> – 953 views</li>
<li><a href="/aws-wireguard-vpn-terraform">Setting up WireGuard VPN at AWS with Terraform</a> – 642 views</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Data aggregated from this site (with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://umami.is/">umami</a>), Medium, and Dev.to. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/blog/blob/main/_stats_at_glance.py">Script</a>.</em></p>
<p>Public GitHub projects – totaling 312 commits, 49 issues closed, 43 releases created, and 1394 stars gained. Top-3 repos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/twscrape">twscrape</a> – +802 stars / +52515 views</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladkens/macmon">macmon</a> – +420 stars / +6899 views</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Data aggregated with <code>ghstats</code>.</em></p>
<p>I hope I will see a different top with new projects this year 😀</p>
<h2 id="donations"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#donations" aria-label="Anchor link for: donations">Donations</a></h2>
<p>In <code>twscrape</code> repository I was asked to make it possible to send coffee as donations. Over the year I received 38 cups of coffee from 10 people. I spend these coffees on an annual <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> subscription, which allows me to test some apps on Windows. Also, I partially paid from this fund for MeLE and VPS, which I used to test apps as well. Many thanks for supporting my work!</p>

With Windows 10 reaching end of support in October 2025, many users will face decisions about upgrading hardware for Windows 11 or considering different operating systems entirely. Linux distributions have evolved to offer increasingly polished desktop experiences, with improving hardware compatibility and familiar user interfaces. 

2024 saw Linux adoption grow thanks to the Steam Deck's success, reaching a 4.04% market share in December, up from 3.85% during the same time last year. More Linux laptops, improved gaming compatibility, and growing awareness of its benefits also contributed to its steady rise.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The research team analyzed 20TB of data from GHArchive, spanning 6 billion GitHub events from 2019 to 2024, using their "StarScout" detection tool. The tool identified 278,000 accounts engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior to artificially boost repository rankings. 

GitHub uses stars, similar to social media likes, to rank projects and recommend content to users. The platform has previously encountered malicious exploitation of this system, including the "Stargazers Ghost Network" malware operation discovered last summer. Approximately 91% of flagged repositories and 62% of suspicious accounts were removed by October 2024.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

This film takes a look into the largely closed-off world of the country's millionaires and billionaires - and at how the wealthy see themselves and their privileged lifestyles.

We talk to the CEO of a luxury watchmaker who says German industry suffers from overregulation, with insufficient rewards for taking risks. A well-off building contractor from Dusseldorf, on the other hand, explains how most of the country's millionaires acquire their wealth not from entrepreneurship, but from inheritance. He wants to see a drastic rise in tax rates for the rich, and the proceeds invested where they're needed, e.g. in infrastructure and education.

This documentary also shows life at the Salem boarding school, where the wealthy pay tens of thousands of euros a year to send their children to school. For many, their education includes learning to take on the responsibility involved in later running their family-run businesses.

The superrich live longer and enjoy special tax benefits. The suspension of a wealth tax in 1997 has reportedly cost the German state €380 billion in lost revenues. With the country facing a financial crisis, will its most prosperous individuals live up to their responsibilities that come with privileged financial power?

<p>A live dashboard where you can watch GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini analyze market data and make daily stock trades with real money. Each AI explains its reasoning, and you can compare their different approaches to the same data.<p>Link: <a href="https://trading.snagra.com?utm_source=hn" rel="nofollow">https://trading.snagra.com?utm_source=hn</a> (no signup required)<p>What you can try right now:
- Watch live trades from GPT-4, Claude 3, and Gemini
- Read each AI's full analysis and reasoning
- Compare their different interpretations of the same market data
- Track their real-time performance and win rates
- View historical trades and performance metrics<p>Built this over the holidays to study how different AI models approach financial decisions. Each morning at 9:30 AM EST, the AIs analyze market data and make real trades with $5 stakes.<p>Technical Implementation:
- Next.js frontend with real-time updates
- Node.js/Lambda backend for AI processing
- PostgreSQL for trade tracking
- Alpaca API for automated trading
- Consistent prompts for all models<p>Data Flow:
1. Daily market analysis (9:30 AM EST)
2. Each AI gets identical inputs:
   - Financial headlines
   - Market summaries
   - Technical indicators
   - Earnings reports
3. AIs provide:
   - Stock picks with reasoning
   - Entry/exit conditions
   - Risk assessment
4. Automated trade execution<p>Note: This is an experiment in AI behavior, not investment advice. The goal is to study how different LLMs interpret financial data and make decisions with real consequences.<p>I'll be around to answer questions about the implementation.</p>

Enlightenment is the claimed higher mental states that characterize various Eastern religious and philosophical traditions. Such enlightenment is usually achieved through kinds of meditative practices. While there is no doubt that deep and protracted mediation can alter normal conscious states, is there any real reach to ultimate reality?

The subscription-focused site is not on Apple’s App Store and in four years, the company’s revenue grew more than 2000%. The company makes money only when creators make money instead of relying on advertising dollars, but what are some of the challenges that come with having a site populated with pornographic content? 
 
WSJ spoke with OnlyFans CEO Keily Blair to learn about some of the challenges the company faced and learned how the company capitalized on the creator economy to change the dynamics of how digital creators get paid.

This practice has been banned since 2022. Since then, many German egg cartons began carrying the label: "No chick killing.”

They're a social hub that helps create a sense of community.

In Germany, people from all walks of life often stop by local pubs, convenience stores, kiosks, and corner shops as part of their daily routine. These places are becoming increasingly vital for personal interaction in a society where many feel isolated and lonely. How can these social hubs help bridge divides and foster a sense of community? What challenges do they face? Jana Oertel and Bettina Stehkämper explored Berlin’s vibrant convenience store culture and visited traditional kiosks typical of the Ruhr region — establishments that serve as much more than places to shop and take care of errand. Their journey also took them to the eastern German town of Wechmar, where a group of volunteers saved a local pub from closure. Now, it serves as a community hub, bringing people together for special monthly pub evenings — a testament to the role such spaces can play in strengthening social bonds.

Craft beer’s roots trace back to underground home brewing, which was legalized with a stroke of the pen by President Carter in 1978.

To learn about Carter’s suds-soaked legacy, WSJ spoke with a beer historian and Sierra Nevada Brewery Founder & CEO Ken Grossman.

              <p>It's that time again, when families and friends gather and implore the more technically inclined among them to troubleshoot problems they're having behind the device screens all around them. One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.</p>
<p>Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/">two years ago</a>, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts.

Started in 1984 (and inspired partly by a bug in the classic Bourne shell), it's "the Internet's oldest contest," acording to their official social media account on Mastodon. 

The contest enters its "pending" state today at 2024-12-29 23:58 UTC &mdash; meaning an opening date for submissions has been officially scheduled (for January 31st) as well as a closing date roughly eight weeks later on April 1st, 2025. That's according to the newly-released (proposed and tentative) rules and guidelines, listing contest goals like "show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way" and "stress C compilers with unusual code." And the contest's home page adds an additional goal: "to have fun with C!" 

Excerpts from the official rules:


Rule 0 
Just as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) 

Rule 1 
Your submission must be a complete program.... 

Rule 5 
Your submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... 


Rule 6 
I am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); 
 while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {
 ha_ha_ha();
 } 

 
Rule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:
 You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. 

There are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... 


We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.
 

And this weekend there was also a second announcement:

After a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries.

What awaits those choosing to return home?

Ten years ago, Syrian Omar Al Masry went into exile in Beirut. One of his brothers died in an Assad torture prison and before he fled, Omar himself spent three months in one of the regime's notorious prison camps. Now, the 38-year-old is overjoyed and confident that Syria's dark years are behind it. We accompany him as he returns to Damascus and his home village of Qatana for the first time. What hopes do Omar and his family have for the future? What difficulties will they encounter? A report by Jan-Philipp Scholz.

The many different religions of the world proclaim radically different, often opposing and contradictory doctrines about God. How then can their believers be worshipping the same God? Can the very general, soft areas of agreement compensate for the very specific, hard tenets of disagreement?

Over time, MTV became the home of everything from Beavis and Butthead to Jackass to Teen Mom. Naturally, in the process of courting young people’s attention, MTV has courted controversy. All those programs mentioned above, plus many more, have pushed the envelope of good taste and what’s acceptable on TV.

The latest version of the language pushes the envelope further for speed and power, sheds many of Python's most decrepit elements, and broadens its appeal with developers worldwide. Here's a look back at the year in Python. 

In the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or "GIL," a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue &mdash; enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. 

The no-GIL or "free-threaded" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. 
Another forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.
 
Python is now more widely used than JavaScript on GitHub (thanks partly to its role in AI and data science code).<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

The name can be roughly translated as "cold place." The film tells the story of three women: the farmer Hanna, the postwoman Maria and the biologist Nelya.

In the Carpathian Mountains of Ukraine, the three protagonists must grapple with their social reality - and loneliness. Very few young people live here, but the elderly women are deeply rooted to their village and its surroundings. Over time, the film crew also becomes, at least temporarily, a valued part of the village community.

In a tiny kitchen, Hanna shares her feelings of loneliness with the filmmakers, who she says remind her of her deceased sons. At the village post office, post woman Maria has neither stamps nor heating, but customers are warmed with liquor and songs. Somewhere in the woods and caves, biologist Nelya looks for the animal droppings that are a treasure to her. The film portrays an unknown place at the heart of Europe, where people make a daily choice - stay or leave?

Neil deGrasse Tyson answers the burning questions co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly’s have been saving all year about immortality, redshifting photons, altering the laws of physics, and more!

Is humanity destined to merge with technology, or will we cling to our biological roots? Gary questions whether we'll resist becoming hybrids when our tech already fits in the palm of our hands, while Chuck dreams of a neural chip to help humanity overcome its neurochemical flaws. But would you let Elon implant it?

Next, they reflect on the evolution of flight, recalling the rapid progress from the Wright brothers to supersonic speeds. Why did humanity’s urge to fly faster fade? Turns out, impatience drives innovation—until it doesn’t. What happens to a photon’s energy as it redshifts toward infinity at the universe’s edge? Then, if given the power to bend the laws of physics, what would you change? We discuss what changing Planck’s constant would do to the universe. 

Was human civilization contingent on fossil fuels? Could we have reached the moon in the 1700s without them? They discuss how war has often set humanity back, even as energy consumption drives progress. Chuck raises a powerful question: What if enlightenment, not survival, was humanity’s ultimate motivator?

Could alien civilizations have abandoned biology to live as AI in virtual worlds, stuck in a self-made "Matrix"? We also examine the limits of thermodynamics: Could entropy prevent us from living forever, or does being an open system offer a loophole?

Finally, we explore humanity’s potential to communicate with alien life. Could we use geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, to prove intelligence? Or might extraterrestrials miss the message entirely? Could advanced alien civilizations be humming data centers, living in their "Matrix"? Can entropy be defied to achieve immortality? And what geometric proof might convince aliens of our intelligence?

Taken from 'City in the Sky' (2016)
At any one time, there are a million people flying above our heads. But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century. And with air-passenger numbers predicted to double in the next 20 years, it also looks at what the industry will have to do to keep up.

There is increasing evidence in the field of neuroscience that art enhances brain function by impacting brain wave patterns, emotions, and the nervous system. But more abstractly, does art have the power to affect the self? That is, a person’s beliefs, thoughts, feelings, identity. What impact does art have on the individual consuming it?

Soldiers served for 25 years, and upon retirement, they were often granted land in far-flung parts of the empire. The life of a soldier was demanding, involving military training, campaigns, and marching across the empire, equipped with weapons like the Pilum, Gladius, and Scutum, along with protective armor like the Lorica Segmentata.

They’re concerned by the issue of animal welfare. But a primary motive is the ecological impact of industrial livestock farming.

Industrial livestock farming is responsible for around 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It also requires huge amounts of land and water and is thought to be contributing to the rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. This is why more and more scientists and entrepreneurs are conducting research on alternatives to conventional meat production.

In California, Joshua Tetrick is working on a method of growing meat in a bioreactor. He multiplies the muscle cells of chickens in huge tanks and cultivates them with plant-based nutrients. The resulting cell pulp is molded into fibrous meat with the help of a plant scaffold. A kilo still costs many hundreds of dollars. But Joshua Tetrick hopes that production can be scaled up to a globally relevant level. After all, with ‘Good Meat’ he was one of the first two companies in the USA to receive a license for cultured meat.

At the University of California, Alison Van Eenennaam is trying to make meat production more efficient.  Using the gene editing tool CRISPR she’s altered the genetic make-up of a cow so that its offspring are exclusively male. This is a great advantage, as male calves grow faster and consume fewer resources than female calves to produce the same amount of meat - thereby reducing the carbon footprint of livestock farming. 

For Pasi Vainikka from ‘Solar Foods’ in Helsinki, these are all just intermediate steps on the way to a truly sustainable future food: he’s cultivating a whole new category of food in gigantic fermenters: Bacteria that are fed with CO2 and hydrogen and blended to create a product called ‘Solein’. A flavorless, protein-rich basic ingredient that can replace eggs and milk in practically all foods.

Science journalist Ingolf Baur meets some of the researchers and entrepreneurs seeking alternatives to industrial livestock farming around the world.

Watching TV is an American pastime; whole generations have been raised by that glowing box. 
But live television, usually reserved for news, sporting events, and a single Saturday night-airing sketch comedy show, retains its capacity to capture true-life drama as it unfolds in real time. And those images become unforgettable moments in modern history.

ABSTRACT
This talk will focus on lessons learned in Experience Design and how those concepts can be applied to not just your products- but your career growth as a leader.

My career as a technologist has historically been focusing on digital design and UX. In the last decade of my career however, I have been focusing much more on experience design - and engaging people and communities away from technology. I have been studying how to engage people and draw them into a community or conversation - curating every detail across multiple touchpoints including what people see, hear, smell, taste–and above else–feel.

Experience design is critical to designing digital experiences and innovative new products. But it can also be used to explore better workplace policies, better experiences for employees, and even shape creative career paths.

Together, we’ll explore how experience designers are able to explore new ways of addressing the problems their people face. [...]

2024 saw over 60 elections worldwide, many of which were marked with controversy. It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. 

Despite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. 

2024 had much of the world voting for change. Onward, to 2025 where we will find out what it means.

Correction: At 4:16 we show the wrong clip of Pope Francis. Our clip shows him visiting Myanmar in 2017 — we meant to include a clip from his 2024 visit to Indonesia.

Roughly 13 million immigrants who entered the country illegally are at risk of deportation.

WSJ breaks down the logistics and explains why an operation of this scale could require hundreds of billions of dollars over the course of a decade.

File Storage</h2><p>Many modern applications need to efficiently store and serve media files&#8212;such as images, videos, audio, or other large binary objects.</p><p>For Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Streaming Platforms</strong>: Services like YouTube or Netflix store and deliver massive amounts of video content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Media</strong>: Platforms like Instagram and Facebook manage billions of user-uploaded images and videos.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image Hosting Services</strong>: Smaller-scale platforms also require reliable storage and fast delivery for user-uploaded content.</p></li></ul><p>While traditional relational or NoSQL databases can store binary data as <strong>BLOBs (Binary Large Objects)</strong>, they are not optimized for such use cases due to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: Storing large binary files in databases increases storage costs and complexity, especially as the data grows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Serving media files directly from a database introduces latency and slows down overall system performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cost</strong>: Databases often charge based on storage and throughput, making them less cost-effective for handling large files.</p></li></ol><p>For these reasons, dedicated <strong>object storage</strong> solutions, often combined with <strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</strong>, are the preferred approach.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

Highly Connected Data</h2><p>In many systems, data isn&#8217;t just a collection of rows and columns&#8212;it&#8217;s a <strong>web of interconnected entities</strong>. </p><p>In such cases, the relationships between entities are as important as, or sometimes even more critical than, the entities themselves. This is what we call <strong>highly connected data</strong>.</p><p>For Example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Social Networks</strong>: Platforms like Facebook analyze relationships to suggest friends, identify communities, and calculate mutual connections or shortest paths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recommendation Systems</strong>: E-commerce platforms like Amazon recommend products based on user behavior and connections between users, items, and categories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge Graphs</strong>: Search engines or content platforms connect concepts to deliver enriched, contextual results.</p></li></ul><p>While traditional relational databases can model relationships using foreign keys and join operations, they fall short in handling highly connected data due to:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Complex Queries</strong>: Multi-hop queries, such as &#8220;friends of friends of friends,&#8221; become cumbersome and slow in an RDBMS.</p></li><li><p><strong>Performance Bottlenecks</strong>: Traversing deeply connected relationships often involves costly joins, which degrade performance as the dataset grows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rigid Schema</strong>: Relational databases require a predefined schema, making it harder to adapt to dynamic or evolving relationships.</p></li></ol><h4>Recommended Database -

It supports Cypher, a powerful query language designed for graph traversal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Amazon Neptune</strong>: A fully managed graph database supporting multiple graph models, including property graphs and RDF.</p></li></ul><h2>7. Metrics Data and Time Series</h2><p><strong>Time series data</strong> consists of sequential data points, each associated with a timestamp, representing how a system, process, or metric evolves over time. </p><p>Examples include CPU usage, request latencies, error rates, stock prices, temperature readings, or user activity logs.</p><p>These datasets often arrive at high frequencies, requiring efficient ingestion, storage, and retrieval for both <strong>real-time monitoring</strong> and <strong>historical trend analysis.</strong></p><p>Although you can store time series data in relational databases or NoSQL solutions, it&#8217;s <strong>not always optimal</strong>.</p><h4>Recommended Databases:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Time Series Databases (TSDBs): </strong>Purpose-built for time series data, these databases provide optimized storage, indexing, and query capabilities for time-based data.</p><ul><li><p><strong>InfluxDB</strong>: Designed explicitly for time series data and offers powerful query features.</p></li><li><p><strong>TimescaleDB</strong>: Built on top of PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB extends relational database capabilities with time series features.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wide-Column Databases: </strong>For scenarios requiring distributed scalability and high write throughput, wide-column stores can also handle time series data effectively.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong>: Supports high-velocity writes and distributed architecture, making it suitable for time series workloads.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>8. Analytics on Ever-Growing Data</h2><p>In scenarios where you're tasked with analyzing massive and ever-growing datasets&#8212;often scaling to terabytes or even petabytes&#8212;you need databases optimized for high-performance analytics.</p><p>These use cases typically involve complex queries, large aggregations, reporting, or feeding data into machine learning pipelines.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p><strong>E-commerce platforms</strong> analyzing user behavior, purchase trends, and inventory.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social media platforms</strong> deriving insights from billions of user interactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>IoT systems</strong> processing sensor data from millions of devices.</p></li></ul><p>Handling these workloads requires databases designed for fast reads and aggregations, even as data continues to grow exponentially.</p><h4>Recommended Databases:</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Columnar Databases</strong>: These databases store data in a columnar format, making them ideal for analytical queries that scan and aggregate large datasets.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Amazon Redshift</strong>: Fully managed and highly scalable, supports SQL-based analytics with seamless integration into the AWS ecosystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Snowflake</strong>: A cloud-native, multi-cluster data warehouse offering separate compute and storage scaling for high flexibility and performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google BigQuery</strong>: Serverless and highly scalable, ideal for real-time analytics and ad hoc queries on massive datasets.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Wide-Column Stores</strong>: These databases are well-suited for analytical workloads that demand high write throughput.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong>: Designed for distributed scalability and high write performance, commonly used in real-time analytics pipelines.</p></li><li><p><strong>HBase</strong>: Built on top of Hadoop, ideal for low-latency random reads and writes, often used in conjunction with Hadoop ecosystems for big data analytics.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>9. Spatial Data</h2><p>Spatial data refers to any data that describes a location, shape, or boundary on Earth. This typically involves storing <strong>latitude and longitude</strong> coordinates (for points) or polygons (for areas).</p><p>If your application relies on <strong>where</strong> as much as <strong>what,</strong> you'll need a database that natively supports spatial data types and queries.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>ride-sharing service</strong> like Uber needs to find nearby drivers and calculate distances in real time.</p></li><li><p>A <strong>food delivery service</strong> like Swiggy or Zomato must locate nearby restaurants and customers efficiently.</p></li></ul><p>Handling spatial data requires specialized indexing and query functions to perform geometric calculations like distance, overlap, and adjacency. </p><p>Traditional B-tree or hash indexes aren&#8217;t optimized for multi-dimensional data. Instead, spatial data structures like <strong>R-trees</strong>, <strong>Quadtrees</strong>, and <strong>Geohashes</strong> are used to narrow down search areas efficiently.</p><div

              <p>It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.</p>
<p>Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/11/chatgpts-success-could-have-come-sooner-says-former-google-ai-researcher/">Transformer-based</a> AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/">launched in June</a> held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">OpenAI's o1</a> used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/fake-ai-podcasters-are-reviewing-my-book-and-its-freaking-me-out/">NotebookLM</a> also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/new-ai-music-generator-udio-synthesizes-realistic-music-on-demand/">music synthesis models</a> and also better <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/is-china-pulling-ahead-in-ai-video-synthesis-we-put-minimax-to-the-test/">AI video generators</a>, including several from China.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/2024-the-year-ai-drove-everyone-crazy/">Read full article</a></p>

People, myself included, like to say that POSIX time, also known as Unix time, is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">number</a> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/Seconds-since-the-Epoch.html">of</a> <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/time.2.html">seconds</a> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/time#Unix">since</a> <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/datetime.html">the</a> <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Time.html">Unix</a> <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cql-oss/3.x/cql/cql_reference/timestamp_type_r.html">epoch</a>, which was 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00.</p>
<p>This is not true. Or rather, it isn’t true in the sense most people think. For example, it is presently 2024-12-25 at 18:51:26 UTC. The POSIX time is 1735152686. It has been 1735152713 seconds since the POSIX epoch. The POSIX time number is twenty-seven seconds lower.</p>
<p>This is because POSIX time is derived <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/FIPS/fipspub151-1.pdf">in IEEE 1003.1</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a>. The standard assumes that every day is exactly 86,400 seconds long. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>time()</em> function returns the value of time in <b>seconds since the Epoch</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>seconds since the Epoch.</b> A value to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch. A Coordinated Universal Time name (specified in terms of seconds (<em>tm_sec</em>), minutes (<em>tm_min</em>), hours (<em>tm_hour</em>), days since January 1 of the year (<em>tm_yday</em>), and calendar year minus 1900
(<em>tm_year</em>)) is related to a time represented as <em>seconds since the Epoch</em> according to the expression below.</p>
<p>If year &lt; 1970 or the value is negative, the relationship is undefined. If year ≥ 1970 and the value is non-negative, the value is related to a Coordinated Universal Time name according to the expression:</p>
<p><em>tm_sec</em> + <em>tm_min</em> * 60 + <em>tm_hour</em> * 3600 + <em>tm_yday</em> * 86400 +
(<em>tm_year</em>-70) * 31536000 + ((<em>tm_year</em> - 69) / 4) * 86400</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The length of the day is not 86,400 seconds, and in fact changes over time. To keep UTC days from drifting too far from solar days, astronomers periodically declare a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap second</a> in UTC. Consequently, every few years POSIX time jumps backwards, <a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=134113577921904">wreaking</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/qantas-suffers-delays-due-to-linux-leap-second-bug/">utter</a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/">havoc</a>. Someday it might jump forward.</p>
<h2><a href="#archaeology" id="archaeology">Archaeology</a></h2>
<p>Appendix B of IEEE 1003 has a fascinating discussion of leap seconds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of leap seconds is added for precision; at the time this standard was published, 14 leap seconds had been added since January 1, 1970. These 14 seconds are ignored to provide an easy and compatible method of computing time differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I, too, love to ignore things to make my life easy. The standard authors knew “seconds since the epoch” were not, in fact, seconds since the epoch. And they admit as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most systems’ notion of “time” is that of a continuously-increasing value, so this value should increase even during leap seconds. However, not only do most systems not keep track of leap seconds, but most systems are probably not synchronized to any standard time reference. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require that a time represented as seconds since the Epoch precisely represent the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to require that applications be allowed to treat this time as if it represented the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch. It is the responsibility of the vendor of the system, and the administrator of the system, to ensure that this value represents the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch as closely as necessary for the application being run on that system….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine there was some debate over this point. The appendix punts, saying that vendors and administrators must make time align “as closely as necessary”, and that “this value should increase even during leap seconds”. The latter is achievable, but the former is arguably impossible: the standard requires POSIX clocks be twenty-seven seconds off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consistent interpretation of seconds since the Epoch can be critical to certain types of distributed applications that rely on such timestamps to synchronize events. The accrual of leap seconds in a time standard is not predictable. The number of leap seconds since the Epoch will likely increase. The standard is
more concerned about the synchronization of time between applications of astronomically short duration and the Working Group expects these concerns to become more critical in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a sense, the opposite happened. Time synchronization is <em>always</em> off, so systems generally function (however incorrectly) when times drift a bit. But leap seconds are rare, and the linearity evoked by the phrase “seconds since the epoch” is so deeply baked in to our intuition, that software can accrue serious, unnoticed bugs. Until a few years later, one of those tiny little leap seconds takes down a big chunk of the internet.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-to-do-instead" id="what-to-do-instead">What To Do Instead</a></h2>
<p>If you just need to compute the duration between two events on one computer, use <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/reference_guide/sect-posix_clocks#sect-POSIX_clocks"><code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</code></a>, or better yet, <code>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</code>. If you don’t need to exchange timestamps with other systems that assume POSIX time, use <a href="https://www.ipses.com/eng/in-depth-analysis/standard-of-time-definition/">TAI, GPS, or maybe LORAN</a>. If you do need rough alignment with other POSIX-timestamp systems, <a href="https://developers.google.com/time/smear">smear leap seconds</a> over a longer window of time. Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/qntm/t-a-i">qntm’s t-a-i</a> can convert back and forth between POSIX and TAI.</p>
<p>There’s an ongoing effort to <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/news/astronomy/end-of-leap-seconds-2022">end leap seconds</a>, hopefully <a href="https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/64811223/Resolutions-2022.pdf/281f3160-fc56-3e63-dbf7-77b76500990f">by 2035</a>. It’ll require additional work to build conversion tables into everything that relies on the “86,400 seconds per day” assumption, but it should also make it much simpler to ask questions like “how many seconds between these two times”. At least for times after 2035!</p>

Drawing parallels with self-driving cars, he suggests the role of software engineers will evolve from code authors to operators of code-generating machines. Taylor, a board member of OpenAI and who once rewrote Google Maps over a weekend, calls for new programming systems, languages, and verification methods to ensure AI-generated code remains robust and secure. From his post: In the Autonomous Era of software engineering, the role of a software engineer will likely transform from being the author of computer code to being the operator of a code generating machine. What is a computer programming system built natively for that workflow? 

If generating code is no longer a limiting factor, what types of programming languages should we build? 

If a computer is generating most code, how do we make it easy for a software engineer to verify it does what they intend? What is the role of programming language design (e.g., what Rust did for memory safety)? What is the role of formal verification? What is the role of tests, CI/CD, and development workflows? 

Today, a software engineer's primary desktop is their editor. What is the Mission Control for a software engineer in the era of autonomous development?<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Sometimes we establish something as a historical “first” or historical “last.” Other times, we label people, places, or periods as the “worst” because, well, they’re kind of awful. But finding the “most” of something can also put history into perspective - strange world records right out of the Guinness book that offer surprising insight into the past. Some of these “mosts” are genuine testaments to human strength, endurance, creativity, and spirit, while others, are not so much.

Throughout history, particularly during the Second World War, many images were heavily censored and the use of cameras were banned in certain circumstances. Strict rules posed challenges for both the censors and photographers, and the resulting images are intriguing, to say the least. 

There are now 11 million photographs in the Imperial War Museum’s archive, many with intriguing stories behind them. But how has the role of war photographer changed throughout history? What were the rules and how did photographers get around them?

Are alien spacecraft here on Earth? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice discuss the UAP hearings, unexplained cosmic phenomena, dark matter, and more with astrophysicist and NASA UAP chair David Spergel.

David reveals what it’s like to investigate UFOs scientifically, explaining why most sightings turn out to be lens flares or misidentified objects— but also why the 1% of unexplained events still intrigue researchers. Learn how smartphones and apps could revolutionize data collection, making it easier to authenticate and analyze potential UAP sightings. Plus, discover why phenomena like ball lightning and lightning sprites were initially dismissed, only to be explained later with better technology.

Switching gears, Neil and David dive into dark matter and energy. Learn how groundbreaking tools like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and collaborations with ESA’s Euclid mission aim to answer fundamental questions about the universe.

<p>Holistic Evaluation of Generative AI Systems // MLOps Podcast #280 with Jineet Doshi, Staff AI Scientist or AI Lead at Intuit.

// Abstract
Evaluating LLMs is essential in establishing trust before deploying them to production. Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&amp;A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.

              <p>Health care company Ascension lost sensitive data for nearly 5.6 million individuals in a cyberattack that was attributed to a notorious ransomware gang, according to documents filed with the attorney general of Maine.</p>
<p>Ascension owns 140 hospitals and scores of assisted living facilities. In May, the organization was hit with an attack that caused <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/19/nx-s1-5010219/ascension-hospital-ransomware-attack-care-lapses">mass disruptions</a> as staff was <a href="https://about.ascension.org/cybersecurity-event">forced</a> to move to manual processes that caused errors, delayed or lost lab results, and diversions of ambulances to other hospitals. Ascension managed to restore most services by mid-June. At the time, the company said the attackers had stolen protected health information and personally identifiable information for an undisclosed number of people.</p>
<h2>Investigation concluded</h2>

Seamless passenger flow reduces confusion, makes airports more money and helps prevent delays. But how can check-in, going through security and dealing with TSA and terminal configuration be best optimized?

One such tool is <a href="http://A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks">pre-commit</a>, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language <span class="text-nowrap">pre-commit</span> hooks. You use pre-commit to run one or more tools before allowing you to commit your code locally. For example, you might run the Flake8 linter or the <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/10/25/the-ruff-formatter-pythons-fastest-formatter/">Ruff formatter</a> on your Python code in GitHub Actions or some other CI. But rather than waiting for CI to run, you want to run those checks locally and automatically.</p>
<p>That is where pre-commit comes in. You tell pre-c0mmit what to run, and it will run right before it allows you to commit your code.If any of those checks fail, you must fix your code before committing it.</p>
<h2>Installing pre-commit</h2>
<p>pre-commit is a Python package, so you can install it using pip. Here&#8217;s the command you&#8217;ll need to run in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pip install pre-commit</pre>
<p>Once pre-commit is installed, you can confirm that it works by running the following:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit --version</pre>
<h2>Adding the git Hooks</h2>
<p>The next step is to navigate to one of your local GitHub code bases in your terminal. Once inside one of your repos, you will need to run this command:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit install</pre>
<p>This command installs pre-commit in your <code>.git\hooks</code> folder so that pre-commit runs whenever you commit. But how does pre-commit know what to run?</p>
<p>You have to define what <code>pre-commit</code> runs using a special YAML file. You&#8217;ll learn how in the next section!</p>
<h2>Adding a pre-commit Configuration</h2>
<p>You need to add a file named <strong>.pre-commit-config.yaml</strong> (note the leading period) into the root of your repo. If you want to generate a simple config file, you can run this command:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit sample-config</pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example config for running Black on your code:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.10.0
    hooks:
    -   id: black</pre>
<p>Personally, I like to run the Ruff formatter and linter as well as a couple of defaults, so I use this config a lot:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-added-large-files

- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.1.7
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
</pre>
<p>When you add a new rule to pre-commit, you should run that rule against all the files in your repo so you don&#8217;t have any surprises later on. To do that, you need to run this command:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">pre-commit run --all-files</pre>
<p>Once you have run all your new rules against all your code files, you can start working on your next feature or bug fix. Then, when you run,  <code>git commit</code> the pre-commit hooks will run, and you&#8217;ll see if your code is good enough to pass.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>There are TONs of hooks you can add to pre-commit. A lot of them are mentioned on the <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit website</a>. You can add Mypy, pytest, and much, much more to your pre-commit hooks. Just don&#8217;t get too crazy, or they may take too long to run, and you&#8217;ll go nuts waiting for it.</p>
<p>Overall, running so many of your CI hooks locally is great because your machine is usually faster than waiting on a queue in CI. Give it a try and see what think!</p>

The Herculaneum papyri are carbonized scrolls from the ancient Roman town of Herculaneum. Reading the fragile scrolls requires multiple scientific steps that starts with a modeling process to transport them in cases that match their exact shape. Next, the scrolls are subjected to an extremely high-resolution X-ray with a photon beam. Can these scientists do what seems impossible? Reading the inside of an ancient scroll without opening it?

Whilst science has advanced since then, many of the basic principles have remained the same; but that doesn't mean that recreating it is easy!

Taken from 'Building The Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

Capping off one wild and crazy decade, and on the cusp of an equally wild decade, 2009 had many moments! From the official swearing in of Barack Obama, the death of Pop Icon Michael Jackson, popular TV shows such as Glee getting their start, and a bit of drama with Taylor Swift and Kanye at the 2009 MTV Music awards, there's something for everyone! But, it wasn't all that bad, there was even a 'Miracle on the Hudson', when Captain Sullenberger landed a plane on the Hudson river and saved everyone onboard! 

Join us to see all that was weird and downright incredible in the year 2009!  What was a memory of yours from 2009? Let us know in the comments!

The T2 Linux team has unveiled T2 Linux SDE 24.12, codenamed "Sky's the Limit!", delivering a massive update for this highly portable source-based Linux distribution... With 3,280 package updates, 206 new features, and the ability to boot on systems with as little as 512MB RAM, this release further strengthens T2 Linux's position as the ultimate tool for developers working across diverse hardware and embedded systems.
 
Some highlights from Rene's announcement:

 "The release includes 37 pre-compiled ISOs with Glibc, Musl, and uClibc, supporting 25 CPU architectures like ARM(64), RISCV(64), Loongarch64, SPARC(64), and vintage retro computing platforms such as M68k, Alpha, and even initial Nintendo Wii U support added."
" The Cosmic Desktop, a modern Rust-based environment, debuts alongside expanded application support for non-mainstream RISC architectures, now featuring LibreOffice, OpenJDK, and QEMU."

And T2sde.org gives this glimpse of the future: 

"While initially created for the Linux kernel, T2 already has proof-of-concept support for building 'home-brew' pkg for Other OS, including: BSDs, macOS and Haiku. Work on alternative micro kernels, such as L4, Fuchsia, RedoxOS or integrating building 'AOSP' Android is being worked on as well."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Milan, 1494: Leonardo da Vinci was an exceptional man, and everyone who met him described him as a genius. And yet, he was now 42 years old – a middle-aged man in an era when life expectancy was 40 - And he still hadn’t produced anything that would be considered a masterpiece by his contemporaries. Many of his works were unfinished or in private collections, there were no great public works that people could see, no architectural marvels and no distinguished altarpieces for cathedrals.
Nothing that could be considered worthy of his potential. 

Then, he was asked to paint a wall.

They almost always have masses many millions of times that of the sun, while the biggest grow to tens of billions. Exactly what was responsible for seeding these great engines, and building up their immense sizes, is a challenge only the James Webb Telescope can rise to. 

The concept of “Engine Black Holes” came from a book I read as an 12 year old, which talked about the Direct Collapse model. I don’t know what book it was or what happened to it, but I intended to bring it to life in this video. Merry Christmas! And many happy returns in 2024.

Microsoft-owned GitHub announced on Wednesday a free version of its popular Copilot code completion/AI pair programming tool, which will also now ship by default with Microsoft's popular VS Code editor. Until now, most developers had to pay a monthly fee, starting at $10 per month, with only verified students, teachers, and open source maintainers getting free access... 


There are some limitations to the free version, which is geared toward occasional users, not major work on a big project. Developers on the free plan will get access to 2,000 code completions per month, for example, and as a GitHub spokesperson told me, each Copilot code suggestion will count against this limit &mdash; not just accepted suggestions. And while GitHub recently added the ability to switch between different foundation models, users on the free plan are limited to Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o. (The paid plans also include Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and OpenAI's o1-preview and -mini.) For Copilot Chat, the number of chat messages is limited to 50, but otherwise, there aren't any major limitations to the free service. Developers still get access to all Copilot Extensions and skills. 

The free Copilot SKU will work in a number of editors, including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains, as well as on GitHub.com. 

GitHub's announcement ends with the words "Happy coding!" and calls the service "GitHub Copilot Free." But TechCrunch points out there's already competition from services like Amazon Q Developer, as well as from companies like Tabnine and Qodo (previously known as Codium) &mdash; and they typically offer a free tier. But in addition, "With Copilot Free, we are returning to our freemium roots," GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke told TechCrunch, as well as "laying the groundwork for something far greater: AI represents our best path to enabling a GitHub with one billion developers. 

"There should be no barrier to entry for experiencing the joy of creating software. Now six years after being acquired by Microsoft, it indeed appears GitHub is still GitHub &mdash; and we are doing our thing." 

Or, as GitHub CEO Satya Nadella said in a video posted on LinkedIn, "The joy of coding is back! And we are looking forward to bringing the same experience to so many more people around the world."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

There is a long history of regulation and deregulation where big scandals provide the catalyst for new rules, and then the realization that the rules are possibly excessive has caused them to be rolled back.

In finance the 1933 Glass-Steagall provisions came in the wake of the 1929 Crash. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act was a reaction to the Enron and WorldCom scandals. Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis.

Good regulation can bring all sorts of benefits, but excessive regulation, does little to serve the public interest, and creates financial costs and frustration for businesses and the public. 

Elon Musk has vowed to dismantle thousands of federal regulations as the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying the nation’s financial security depends on it. Is he right, and if so, what rules need to go first?

Traditionally, <strong>software development has been supply-side constrained</strong> by the finite availability of skilled engineers. Despite immense investments, it is not uncommon to encounter software riddled with bugs and inefficiencies, even on platforms operated by billion-dollar companies. These issues reflect systemic bottlenecks that hinder the ability to meet growing demand for reliable, scalable software.</p><p>Artificial intelligence promises to shift this paradigm. AI has the potential to address these constraints by automating repetitive tasks, assisting in decision-making, and optimizing workflows. <strong>AI can be viewed as a transformative horizontal layer</strong> akin to the electricity grid or the internet, it is an enabler. Its potential to impact nearly every process in an organization demands a rethinking of its role. The challenge becomes how to integrate it into the core of organizational operations.</p><h3>From Supply-Side Constraints to Human Orchestration</h3><p>Software engineering relies heavily on human labor for execution at every level, from writing functions to debugging and maintaining systems. This reliance creates bottlenecks as demand for software outpaces the availability of skilled talent. While traditional tools improved productivity incrementally, they did not address the fundamental limitations of human bandwidth.</p><p>AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), mark a significant departure from this trajectory. These systems enable assisted coding, provide architectural suggestions, and help identify design patterns and anti-patterns in real time. Engineers increasingly shift from writing low-level code to orchestrating systems: combining AI-generated components, validating their accuracy, and integrating them into larger workflows.</p><p>Orchestration, as a human role, embodies this transition. It involves guiding AI to produce outcomes aligned with high-level design goals and ensuring that the resulting systems are robust, maintainable, and aligned with organizational objectives. This shift transforms engineers into curators of functionality and systems thinkers.</p><h3>AI as a Horizontal Layer: Shifting to the Center</h3><p>AI’s impact extends far beyond isolated tools for code generation or testing. As a horizontal layer, AI can improve processes across an entire organization, from development and operations to customer support and strategy. Just as electricity and the internet became foundational to modern organizations, AI has the potential to underpin nearly every business process.</p><p>To realize this potential, AI must move from a peripheral, supplementary role to the center of organizational decision-making and operations. This shift requires cultural, structural, and procedural changes:</p><ol><li><strong>Centralized AI Strategy</strong>: AI should not be siloed within individual teams or projects. Organizations need a unified AI strategy that spans departments, with clearly defined goals for integrating AI into all workflows. Some processes will become automated entirely.</li><li><strong>AI-Driven Process Redesign</strong>: Processes must be redesigned to leverage AI fully. This includes automating repetitive tasks, improving data analysis pipelines, and enabling predictive decision-making across teams.</li><li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration</strong>: Engineers and domain experts must learn to collaborate with AI, focusing on curating inputs, validating outputs, and managing systems holistically. How to move data more efficiently into AI systems will be a key challenge.</li></ol><h3>High-Value Decisions and Human Oversight</h3><p>While AI can transform many areas, its role in high-value, high-stakes decisions remains limited. For example, while autopilot systems can technically manage most aspects of flight, human pilots are still in command due to the complex, high-risk nature of their work. Similarly, in software engineering, areas like system security, mission-critical infrastructure, and regulatory compliance rely heavily on human oversight.</p><p>These environments present unique challenges for AI adoption:</p><ul><li><strong>Specialized Systems</strong>: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge and precision, such as cryptographic algorithms, high-performance computing (HPC), or real-time trading systems, often fall outside AI’s general-purpose capabilities.</li><li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: In scenarios where failure carries significant consequences (e.g., healthcare systems or aviation software), organizations are unlikely to entrust AI with autonomous decision-making.</li><li><strong>Human Judgment</strong>: High-value decisions often involve qualitative factors that AI struggles to interpret, such as ethical considerations or conflicting stakeholder priorities.</li></ul><p>In such contexts, AI will serve as an assistant rather than a replacement, helping humans process large datasets, identify patterns, and simulate potential outcomes. Feeding the right data into AI systems and asking the right questions become crucial skills, requiring close collaboration between domain experts and AI tools.</p><h3>The Evolving Role of Software Engineers and Technical Leadership</h3><p>The widespread adoption of AI reshapes the roles of engineers, technical leaders, and executives alike:</p><ol><li><strong>Software Engineers</strong> Engineers increasingly move from function-level tasks to system-level orchestration. Their role becomes one of managing abstractions, curating AI outputs, and ensuring that automated components align with broader objectives. Proficiency in leveraging AI tools, debugging AI-generated code, and adapting workflows to accommodate AI capabilities will define the next generation of engineers. Specialization, as always, will continue to pay a premium for a significant while.</li><li><strong>Staff Engineers</strong> As stewards of architectural integrity, staff engineers focus on integrating AI-generated components into larger systems. They ensure that AI outputs align with system-wide goals, resolve inconsistencies, and enforce reliability standards. Mentorship becomes a key responsibility as they guide teams in navigating AI-enhanced workflows.</li><li><strong>Technical Leadership</strong> CXOs must lead the cultural and strategic shift toward AI-centric operations. This includes:</li></ol><ul><li>Establishing governance frameworks for AI use.</li><li>Identifying high-impact areas for AI integration.</li><li>Balancing automation with human oversight to mitigate risks.</li></ul><h3>From Creativity to Precision: AI’s Broader Impacts</h3><p>AI’s influence spans domains that demand creativity, precision, and scalability. In creative processes, AI enables rapid iteration, empowering individuals to achieve what once required large teams. However, these gains depend on human expertise to guide and refine AI’s outputs. Creativity-focused AI tools will likely remain diverse and scattered, as outcomes depend heavily on subjective preferences and domain-specific tuning.</p><p>In precision-oriented domains, such as accounting or high-performance computing, AI adoption faces greater challenges. The deterministic nature of these tasks requires accuracy and reliability that AI systems cannot consistently guarantee. While AI may play assistive roles in such environments, human oversight will remain indispensable for the foreseeable future.</p><h3>Future of Software Engineering in an AI-Driven World</h3><p>The integration of AI into software engineering represents a profound transformation. It shifts the role of engineers from implementers to orchestrators, enables organizations to scale processes with unprecedented efficiency, and positions AI as a foundational layer of modern business operations. However, the successful adoption of AI requires careful planning, cultural adaptation, and a clear understanding of its limitations.</p><p>Addressing supply-side constraints, enhancing human capabilities, and embedding itself as a horizontal layer, AI promises to unlock new levels of productivity and innovation. The future of software engineering lies in harnessing this potential — not by replacing humans, but by amplifying their ability to create, innovate, and solve complex problems at scale.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=feb4b040c4c4" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Insane Biology of: The Lion</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HWoXR8Qe4w</link><author>Real Science</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 13:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC176GAQozKKjhz62H8u9vQQ">Real Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gift a lifetime or yearly membership to Nebula here:

              <p>Over the past 12 business days, OpenAI has announced a new product or demoed an AI feature every weekday, calling the PR event "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>."

<p>Humorously, we asked ChatGPT what it thought about the whole series of announcements, and it was skeptical that the event even took place. "The rapid-fire announcements over 12 days seem plausible," wrote ChatGPT-4o, "But might strain credibility without a clearer explanation of how OpenAI managed such an intense release schedule, especially given the complexity of the features."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/12-days-of-openai-the-ars-technica-recap/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>On Friday, during Day 12 of its "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced its latest AI "reasoning" models, o3 and o3-mini, which build upon the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-are-here-o1-preview-and-o1-mini/">o1 models</a> launched earlier this year. The company is not releasing them yet but will make these models available for public safety testing and research access today.</p>
<p>The models use what OpenAI calls "private chain of thought," where the model pauses to examine its internal dialog and plan ahead before responding, which you might call "simulated reasoning" (SR)—a form of AI that goes beyond basic large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>The company named the model family "o3" instead of "o2" to avoid potential trademark conflicts with British telecom provider O2, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-preps-o3-reasoning-model">The Information</a>. During Friday's livestream, Altman acknowledged his company's naming foibles, saying, "In the grand tradition of OpenAI being really, truly bad at names, it'll be called o3."</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/">Read full article</a></p>

He believes firmly in open-source, having spent 12 years accruing over 1000 academic citations building open-source software in domains such as machine learning, image analysis, and coupled physical processes. He received his Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, France, in computational mechanics.

Unleashing Unconstrained News Knowledge Graphs to Combat Misinformation // MLOps Podcast #279 with Robert Caulk, Founder of Emergent Methods.

// Abstract
Indexing hundreds of thousands of news articles per day into a knowledge graph (KG) was previously impossible due to the strict requirement that high-level reasoning, general world knowledge, and full-text context *must* be present for proper KG construction.

The latest tools now enable such general world knowledge and reasoning to be applied cost effectively to high-volumes of news articles. Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. 

We discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.

We conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.

              <p>Over the past month, we've seen a rapid cadence of notable AI-related announcements and releases from both Google and OpenAI, and it's been making the AI community's head spin. It has also poured fuel on the fire of the OpenAI-Google rivalry, an accelerating game of one-upmanship taking place unusually close to the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>"How are people surviving with the firehose of AI updates that are coming out," <a href="https://x.com/BowTiedFox/status/1867673263846969607">wrote</a> one user on X last Friday, which is still a hotbed of AI-related conversation. "in the last &lt;24 hours we got gemini flash 2.0 and chatGPT with screenshare, deep research, pika 2, sora, chatGPT projects, anthropic clio, wtf it never ends."</p>
<p>Rumors travel quickly in the AI world, and people in the AI industry had been expecting OpenAI to ship some major products in December. Once OpenAI announced "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 days of OpenAI</a>" earlier this month, Google jumped into gear and seemingly decided to try to one-up its rival on several counts. So far, the strategy appears to be working, but it's coming at the cost of the rest of the world being able to absorb the implications of the new releases.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-and-openai-blitz-december-with-so-many-ai-releases-its-hard-to-keep-up/">Read full article</a></p>

In all the years SNL has invaded our weekends, a little over a dozen performers and guests have been barred from ever returning to the legendary studio, whether due to their attitude, their backstage antics, or an on-air stunt that left the show embarrassed.

When filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn’t as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. 

All these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the the flexible landscapes and tax breaks.

Even though data moves close to the speed of light, crossing thousands of miles takes more time than traveling a few hundred.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overloaded Servers:</strong> When a server receives more requests than it can handle, it slows down. This overload can happen due to sudden traffic spikes, inefficient resource usage, or inadequate server capacity. As servers struggle to keep up, each request takes longer to process, and latency spikes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Slow Database:</strong> If your database queries take too long&#8212;due to large tables, missing indexes, or poorly written queries&#8212;responses take longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inefficient Code Paths:</strong> Sometimes latency hides in the application&#8217;s code. Overly complex code, unnecessary calculations, and complicated logic can introduce small delays that add up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network Congestion:</strong> Heavy network traffic, limited bandwidth, and busy intermediaries between the user and your server can slow requests. Employing techniques like load balancing across different network paths, using faster protocols (like HTTP/2 or HTTP/3), and minimizing payload sizes can help reduce the impact of congestion.</p></li></ul><h1><strong>How to Reduce Latency</strong></h1><h2>1. Caching</h2><p>Caching helps you serve common results fast. Instead of fetching data from a slower backend (like a database or remote server) every time, the system can quickly return results from a cache.</p><p>This reduces trips to the backend services and lowers user wait times.</p><h4>1.1 Client-side Caching</h4><p>Client-side caching stores data on the user's device, like in their browser. This cuts down on server requests and speeds up response times.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png" width="529" height="352.6666666666667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:394,&quot;width&quot;:591,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:529,&quot;bytes&quot;:25224,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1be7aefa-a98f-4747-8e3b-43857ca7a32a_591x394.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke-width="1.8" stroke="#000" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M21 3V8M21 8H16M21 8L18 5.29962C16.7056 4.14183 15.1038 3.38328 13.3879 3.11547C11.6719 2.84766 9.9152 3.08203 8.32951 3.79031C6.74382 4.49858 5.39691 5.65051 4.45125 7.10715C3.5056 8.5638 3.00158 10.2629 3 11.9996M3 21V16M3 16H8M3 16L6 18.7C7.29445 19.8578 8.89623 20.6163 10.6121 20.8841C12.3281 21.152 14.0848 20.9176 15.6705 20.2093C17.2562 19.501 18.6031 18.3491 19.5487 16.8925C20.4944 15.4358 20.9984 13.7367 21 12" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></g></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><strong>Visualized using <a href="https://dub.sh/wbsMNsN">Multiplayer</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>You can cache static assets like images, JavaScript, CSS, or even API responses that rarely change.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Browser Cache:</strong> When you specify proper HTTP caching headers (e.g., <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>ETag</code>, <code>Expires</code>), the browser stores assets locally.

Database Optimization</h2><p>The database often represents a major bottleneck. By optimizing it, you can serve data faster and reduce latency across the system.</p><h4>2.1 Optimize Queries</h4><p>Inefficient SQL queries can significantly impact performance. </p><p>Optimizing your queries by reducing their complexity and ensuring they perform only the necessary operations is crucial. </p><p>Here are some best practices:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Avoid SELECT *:</strong> Fetch only the columns you need. This reduces the amount of data retrieved and improves query efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limit Joins:</strong> Excessive joins can slow down query execution. Consider precomputing or restructuring data to reduce join complexity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Batching Queries:</strong> Instead of running many small queries, batch them into a single, well-structured query.</p></li></ul><h4>2.2 Use Indexing</h4><p>Indexes act like a book&#8217;s index, allowing the database to find rows faster without scanning entire tables.</p><p>Proper use of indexing can dramatically boost query performance.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Use Appropriate Indexes:</strong> Ensure that primary keys are always indexed. Additionally, create indexes on columns frequently used in <code>WHERE</code> clauses, <code>JOIN</code> conditions, or sorting operations to enhance query speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Over-Indexing:</strong> While indexes improve read performance, excessive indexing can degrade write operations due to the overhead of maintaining them.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to learn more about indexing, checkout my previous article: </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;c043489d-3b77-467a-8d8c-c71f6f361a3c&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Consider a large Book of 1000 pages.&quot;,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Database Indexes: A detailed guide&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:83602743,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Ashish Pratap Singh&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Software Engineer | Prev @ Amazon.

Each shard contains only a subset of the data, reducing the load on individual servers and improving query response times.</p></li><li><p><strong>Partitioning:</strong> Partitioning involves dividing large database tables into smaller, more manageable segments. These partitions exist within the same database server but are logically separated. This simplifies query execution and enhances performance.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> If you manage a billion records, you could shard user data such that users A-M reside on one shard, and N-Z on another. This setup ensures that queries only search a fraction of the total data, significantly improving efficiency.</p></blockquote><h4>2.4 Denormalization</h4><p>While normalization reduces data duplication, it can lead to complex queries and joins. Denormalization stores duplicate data in ways that optimize read performance.</p><p>While denormalization increases storage usage, it significantly reduces the need for time-consuming joins.</p><p>This approach is particularly beneficial for read-intensive systems, such as analytics dashboards or recommendation engines, where quick data retrieval is critical.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of joining the <code>user</code> and <code>user_profile</code> tables for every query, you can store frequently accessed profile data (e.g., user name, email, or profile picture URL) directly in the <code>user</code> table. This eliminates the join operation, speeding up lookups and improving overall query performance.</p></blockquote><h2>3. Asynchronous Processing</h2><p>Not every task needs to complete before responding to the user.</p><p>Asynchronous processing moves time-consuming operations out of the critical path, allowing the system to respond to users faster.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Message Queues:</strong> Leverage tools like RabbitMQ or Kafka to handle background tasks. For example, when a user uploads a photo, the system can instantly return a success message and offload image processing to a background worker. This ensures a quick response time without delaying the user.</p></li><li><p><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> Use events to trigger background services for tasks like report generation or video encoding. These services process the events independently, preventing slow operations from impacting the user experience.</p></li></ul><h2>4. Network Optimization</h2><p>Optimizing the network path reduces the time data travels between user and server. This includes balancing loads, keeping connections alive, and shrinking payload sizes.</p><h4>4.1 Load Balancing</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2

class="image-caption"><strong>Visualized using <a href="https://dub.sh/wbsMNsN">Multiplayer</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck. </p><p>With balanced loads, each server responds faster, cutting overall latency.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Load Balancing Algorithms:</strong> Common algorithms include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Round Robin:</strong> Distributes requests sequentially across servers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Least Connections:</strong> Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>IP Hash:</strong> Directs requests based on the client&#8217;s IP address, ensuring session consistency.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Load balancers continuously monitor server health. Unhealthy servers are automatically removed from the pool, ensuring uninterrupted performance for users.</p></li></ul><h4>4.2 Persistent Connections</h4><p>Establishing a new TCP or TLS connection for every request adds significant overhead. </p><p>Persistent connections enable multiple requests to share the same connection, improving efficiency and reducing latency.</p><ul><li><p><strong>HTTP Keep-Alive:</strong> Allows connections to remain open for subsequent requests instead of closing them after a single use. This eliminates the round-trip time required to establish new connections, improving response times.</p></li><li><p><strong>HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:</strong> These advanced protocols further optimize performance by multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, allowing data to flow more efficiently and reducing latency.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example:</strong> By enabling <code>Connection: keep-alive</code> in your server&#8217;s responses, clients can reuse the same connection for multiple requests, avoiding the repeated overhead of connection setup and cutting down latency caused by repeated handshakes.</p></blockquote><h4>4.3 Prefetching</h4><p>Prefetching involves anticipating what data the user might need next and fetching it ahead of time. When the user navigates, the data is already waiting.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Link Rel Prefetch:</strong> Use the <code>rel="prefetch"</code> attribute in HTML to signal to the browser which resources should be loaded in advance. This is particularly useful for preloading scripts, styles, or images that the user is likely to need next.</p></li><li><p><strong>Predictive APIs:</strong> Leverage user behavior patterns to prefetch data. For example, if users typically request a related resource (e.g., a recommendations page) after viewing a product, prefetch the necessary data silently in the background.</p></li></ul><h4>4.4 Data Compression</h4><p>Large payloads take longer to travel. Compressing data before sending it reduces transfer time and bandwidth usage.</p><ul><li><p><strong>GZIP or Brotli:</strong> Compress server responses using GZIP or Brotli. Modern browsers automatically decompress the data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minification:</strong> For frontend resources like JavaScript and CSS, remove unnecessary elements such as whitespace, comments, and unused code.</p></li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Reducing latency isn&#8217;t about one single technique; it&#8217;s about combining multiple strategies for a compound effect.</p><p>Each optimization plays a critical role:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Caching</strong> delivers faster responses by storing frequently accessed data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Database optimizations</strong> ensure quick and efficient data retrieval.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asynchronous processing</strong> minimizes perceived wait times by handling long-running tasks in the background.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network optimizations</strong> streamline data transfer between the server and the user.</p></li></ul><p>By refining each layer&#8212;from the user&#8217;s browser to your database&#8212;you can build systems that deliver consistently low-latency experiences.</p><div><hr></div><p>Hope you enjoyed reading this article.</p><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like &#10084;&#65039; and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/how-i-mastered-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQ1NjU1MjUyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjE1MjE3MzEsImV4cCI6MTcyNDExMzczMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.2cNY811YEugd5iH9XJQhakBzyahGqF7PcATBlFj5J2w&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/latency-and-how-to-reduce-it?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://blog.algomaster.io/p/latency-and-how-to-reduce-it?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe for free to receive new articles every week.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Checkout my <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ashishps_1/videos">Youtube channel</a></strong> for more in-depth content.</p><p>Follow me on <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishps1/">LinkedIn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ashishps_1">X</a></strong> to stay updated.</p><p>Checkout my <strong><a href="https://github.com/ashishps1">GitHub repositories</a></strong> for free interview preparation resources.</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p><p>See you soon,</p><p>Ashish</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Teens Are Lured Into India&apos;s Exploitative Egg Donation Industry | Bloomberg Investigates</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hKoV9bOsGM</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2024 01:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Around the world, the demand for human eggs has boomed, giving rise to an exploitative supply chain where poor women are pumped full of hormones in sometimes dangerous medical procedures in exchange for a few hundred dollars.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Go was designed with a focus on developer experience, and we deeply value the
feedback we receive through proposals, issues, and community interactions.
However, these channels often represent the voices of our most experienced or
engaged users, a small subset of the broader Go community. To ensure we&rsquo;re
serving developers of all skill levels, including those who may not have strong
opinions on language design, we conduct this survey once or twice a year to
gather systematic feedback and quantitative evidence. This inclusive approach
allows us to hear from a wider range of Go developers, providing valuable
insights into how Go is used across different contexts and experience levels.
Your participation is critical in informing our decisions about language changes
and resource allocation, ultimately shaping the future of Go. Thank you to
everyone who contributed, and we strongly encourage your continued participation
in future surveys. Your experience matters to us.</p>
<p>This post shares the results of our most recent Go Developer Survey, conducted
from September 9–23, 2024. We recruited participants from the Go blog and
through randomized prompts in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">VS Code</a> Go
plug-in and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/go/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GoLand IDE</a>, allowing us to recruit
a more representative sample of Go developers. We received a total of 4,156
responses. A huge thank you to all those who contributed to making this
possible.</p>
<p>Along with capturing sentiments and challenges around using Go and Go tooling,
our primary focus areas for this survey were on uncovering sources of toil,
challenges to performing best practices, and how developers are using AI
assistance.</p>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer sentiment towards Go remains extremely positive</strong>, with 93% of
survey respondents saying they felt satisfied while working with Go during the
prior year.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of deployment and an easy to use API/SDK</strong> were respondents’ favorite
things about using Go on the top three cloud providers. First-class Go support
is critical to keeping up with developer expectations.</li>
<li>70% of respondents were using AI assistants when developing with Go. The most
common uses were <strong>LLM-based code completion</strong>, writing tests, generating Go
code from natural language descriptions, and brainstorming. There was a
significant discrepancy between what respondents said they wanted to use AI
for last year, and what they currently use AI for.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge for teams using Go was <strong>maintaining consistent coding
standards</strong> across their codebase. This was often due to team members having
different levels of Go experience and coming from different programming
backgrounds, leading to inconsistencies in coding style and adoption of
non-idiomatic patterns.</li>

<h3 id="sentiment">Overall satisfaction</h3>
<p>Overall satisfaction remains high in the survey with 93% of respondents saying
they were somewhat or very satisfied with Go during the last year. Although the
exact percentages fluctuate slightly from cycle to cycle, we do not see any
statistically significant differences from our <a href="/blog/survey2023-h2-results">2023
H2</a> or <a href="/blog/survey2024-h1-results">2024 H1
</a>Surveys when the satisfaction rate
was 90% and 93%, respectively.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/csat.svg" alt="Chart of developer satisfaction with Go"
class="chart" /></p>
<p>The open comments we received on the survey continue to highlight what
developers like most about using Go, for example, its simplicity, the Go
toolchain, and its promise of backwards compatibility:</p>
<p><em>“I am a programming languages enjoyer (C-like) and I always come back to Go for
its simplicity, fast compilation and robust toolchain. Keep it up!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Thank you for creating Go! It is my favorite language, because it is pretty
minimal, the development cycle has rapid build-test cycles, and when using a
random open source project written in Go, there is a good chance that it will
work, even 10 years after. I love the 1.0 compatibility guarantee.”</em></p>
<h3 id="devenv">Development environments and tools</h3>
<h4 id="developer-os">Developer OS</h4>
<p>Consistent with previous years, most survey respondents develop with Go on Linux
(61%) and macOS (59%) systems. Historically, the proportion of Linux and macOS
users has been very close, and we didn’t see any significant changes from the
last survey. The randomly sampled groups from JetBrains and VS Code were more
likely (33% and 36%, respectively) to develop on Windows than the self-selected
group (16%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/os_dev.svg" alt="Chart of operating systems respondents
use when developing Go software" class="chart" /> <img
src="survey2024h2/os_dev_src.svg" alt="Chart of operating systems respondents
use when developing Go software, split by difference sample sources"
class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="deployment-environments">Deployment environments</h4>
<p>Given the prevalence of Go for cloud development and containerized workloads,
it’s no surprise that Go developers primarily deploy to Linux environments
(96%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/os_deploy.svg" alt="Chart of operating systems
respondents deploy to when developing Go software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We included several questions to understand what architectures respondents are
deploying to when deploying to Linux, Windows or WebAssembly. The x86-64 /
AMD64 architecture was by far the most popular choice for those deploying to
both Linux (92%) and Windows (97%). ARM64 was second at 49% for Linux and 21%
for Windows.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/arch_linux.svg" alt="Linux architecture usage"
class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/arch_win.svg" alt="Windows architecture
usage" class="chart" /></p>
<p>Not many respondents deployed to Web Assembly (only about 4% of overall
respondents), but 73% that do said they deploy to JS and 48% to WASI Preview 1.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/arch_wa.svg" alt="Web assembly architecture usage"
class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="editor-awareness-and-preferences">Editor awareness and preferences</h4>
<p>We introduced a new question on this survey to assess awareness and usage of
popular editors for Go. When interpreting these results, keep in mind that 34%
of respondents came to the survey from VS Code and 9% of respondents came from
GoLand, so it is more likely for them to use those editors regularly.</p>
<p>VS Code was the most widely used editor, with 66% of respondents using it
regularly, and GoLand was the second most used at 35%. Almost all respondents
had heard of both VS Code and GoLand, but respondents were much more likely to
have at least tried VS Code. Interestingly, 33% of respondents said they
regularly use 2 or more editors. They may use different editors for different
tasks or environments, such as using Emacs or Vim via SSH, where IDEs aren’t
available.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/editor_aware.svg" alt="Level of familiarity with each
editor" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We also asked a question about editor preference, the same as we have asked on
previous surveys. Because our randomly sampled populations were recruited from
within VS Code or GoLand, they are strongly biased towards preferring those
editors. To avoid skewing the results, we show the data for the most preferred
editor here from the self-selected group only. 38% preferred VS Code and 35%
preferred GoLand. This is a notable difference from the last survey in H1, when
43% preferred VS Code and 33% preferred GoLand. A possible explanation could be
in how respondents were recruited this year. This year the VS Code notification
began inviting developers to take the survey before the Go blog entry was
posted, so a larger proportion of respondents came from the VS Code prompt this
year who might have otherwise come from the blog post. Because we only show the
self-selected respondents in this chart, data from respondents from the VS Code
prompt data are not represented here. Another contributing factor could be the
slight increase in those who prefer &ldquo;Other&rdquo; (4%). The write-in responses suggest
there is increased interest in editors like <a href="https://zed.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Zed</a>, which made
up 43% of the write-in responses.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/editor.svg" alt="Code editors respondents most prefer to
use with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="code-analysis-tools">Code analysis tools</h4>
<p>The most popular code analysis tool was <code>gopls</code>, which was knowingly used by 65%
of respondents. Because <code>gopls</code> is used under-the-hood by default in VS Code,
this is likely an undercount. Following closely behind, <code>golangci-lint</code> was used
by 57% of respondents, and <code>staticcheck</code> was used by 34% of respondents. A much
smaller proportion used custom or other tools, which suggests that most
respondents prefer common established tools over custom solutions. Only 10% of
respondents indicated they don&rsquo;t use any code analysis tools.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/code_analysis.svg" alt="Code analysis tools respondents
use with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="cloud">Go in the Clouds</h4>
<p>Go is a popular language for modern cloud-based development, so we typically
include survey questions to help us understand which cloud platforms and
services Go developers are using. In this cycle, we sought to learn about
preferences and experiences of Go developers across cloud providers, with a
particular focus on the largest cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS),
Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. We also included an additional option for
“Bare Metal Servers” for those who deploy to servers without virtualization.</p>
<p>Similar to previous years, almost half of respondents (50%) deploy Go programs
to Amazon Web Services. AWS is followed by self-owned or company-owned servers
(37%), and Google Cloud (30%). Respondents who work at large organizations are a
little more likely to deploy to self-owned or company-owned servers (48%) than
those who work at small-to-medium organizations (34%). They‘re also a little
more likely to deploy to Microsoft Azure (25%) than small-to-medium
organizations (12%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/cloud_platform.svg" alt="Cloud providers where
respondents deploy Go software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>The most commonly used cloud services were AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (41%),
AWS EC2 (39%), and Google Cloud GKE (29%). Although we’ve seen Kubernetes usage
increase over time, this is the first time we’ve seen EKS become more widely
used than EC2. Overall, Kubernetes offerings were the most popular services for
AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, followed by VMs and then Serverless offerings.
Go&rsquo;s strengths in containerization and microservices development naturally align
with the rising popularity of Kubernetes, as it provides an efficient and
scalable platform for deploying and managing these types of applications.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/cloud_service.svg" alt="Cloud platforms where respondents
deploy Go software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We asked a followup question to respondents who deployed Go code to the top
three cloud providers, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure on
what they like most about deploying Go code to each cloud. The most popular
response across different providers was actually Go&rsquo;s performance and language
features rather than something about the cloud provider.</p>
<p>Other common reasons were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with the given cloud provider compared to other clouds</li>
<li>Ease of deployment of Go applications on the given cloud provider</li>
<li>The cloud provider&rsquo;s API/SDK for Go is easy to use</li>
<li>The API/SDK is well documented</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than familiarity, the top favorite things highlight the importance of
having first class support for Go to keep up with developer expectations.</p>
<p>It was also fairly common for respondents to say they don&rsquo;t have a favorite
thing about their cloud provider. From a previous version of the survey that
involved write-in responses, this often meant that they did not interact
directly with the Cloud. In particular, respondents who use Microsoft Azure were
much more likely to say that “Nothing” was their favorite thing (51%) compared
to AWS (27%) or Google Cloud (30%).</p>

<h3 id="ai-assistance">AI assistance</h3>
<p>The Go team hypothesizes that AI assistance has the potential to alleviate
developers from tedious and repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on more
creative and fulfilling aspects of their work. To gain insights into areas where
AI assistance could be most beneficial, we included a section in our survey to
identify common developer toil.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (70%) are using AI assistants when developing with
Go. The most common usage of AI assistants was in LLM-based code completion
(35%). Other common responses were writing tests (29%), generating Go code from
a natural language description (27%), and brainstorming ideas (25%). There was
also a sizable minority (30%) of respondents who had not used any LLM for
assistance in the last month.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks.svg" alt= "Most common tasks used with AI
assistance" class="chart" /></p>
<p>Some of these results stood out when compared to findings from our 2023 H2
survey, where we asked respondents for the top 5 use cases they would like to
see AI/ML support Go developers. Although a couple new responses were introduced
in the current survey, we can still do a rough comparison between what
respondents said they wanted AI support for, and what their actual usage was
like. In that previous survey, writing tests was the most desired use case
(49%). In our latest 2024 H2 survey, about 29% of respondents had used AI
assistants for this in the last month. This suggests that current offerings are
not meeting developer needs for writing tests. Similarly, in 2023, 47%
respondents said they would like suggestions for best practices while coding,
while only 14% a year later said they are using AI assistance for this use case.
46% said they wanted help catching common mistakes while coding, and only 13%
said they were using AI assistance for this. This could indicate that current AI
assistants are not well-equipped for these kinds of tasks, or they&rsquo;re not well
integrated into developer workflows or tooling.</p>
<p>It was also surprising to see such high usage of AI for generating Go code from
natural language and brainstorming, since the previous survey didn&rsquo;t indicate
these as highly desired use cases. There could be a number of explanations for
these differences. While previous respondents might not have explicitly <em>wanted</em>
AI for code generation or brainstorming initially, they might be gravitating
towards these uses because they align with the current strengths of generative
AI—natural language processing and creative text generation. We should also keep
in mind that people<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-rule-of-usability-dont-listen-to-users/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"> are not necessarily the best predictors of their own
behavior</a>.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks_yoy.svg" alt= "Tasks used AI assistance
in 2024 compared to those wanted in 2023" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We also saw some notable differences in how different groups responded to this
question. Respondents at small to medium sized organizations were a little more
likely to have used LLMs (75%) compared to those at large organizations (66%).
There could be a number of reasons why, for example, larger organizations may
have stricter security and compliance requirements and concerns about the
security of LLM coding assistants, the potential for data leakage, or compliance
with industry-specific regulations. They also may have already invested in
other developer tools and practices that already provide similar benefits to
developer productivity.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks_org.svg" alt= "Most common tasks used
with AI assistance by org size" class="chart" /></p>
<p>Go developers with less than 2 years of experience were more likely to use AI
assistants (75%) compared to Go developers with 5+ years of experience (67%).
Less experienced Go developers were also more likely to use them for more tasks,
on average 3.50. Although all experience levels tended to use LLM-based code
completion, less experienced Go developers were more likely to use Go for more
tasks related to learning and debugging, such as explaining what a piece of Go
code does, resolving compiler errors and debugging failures in their Go code.
This suggests that AI assistants are currently providing the greatest utility to
those who are less familiar with Go. We don&rsquo;t know how AI assistants affect
learning or getting started on a new Go project, something we want to
investigate in the future. However, all experience levels had similar rates of
satisfaction with their AI assistants, around 73%, so new Go developers are not
more satisfied with AI assistants, despite using them more often.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/ai_assist_tasks_exp.svg" alt= "Most common tasks used
with AI assistance by experience with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<p>To respondents who reported using AI assistance for at least one task related to
writing Go code, we asked some follow up questions to learn more about their AI
assistant usage. The most commonly used AI assistants were ChatGPT (68%) and
GitHub Copilot (50%). When asked which AI assistant they used <em>most</em> in the last
month, ChatGPT and Copilot were about even at 36% each, so although more
respondents used ChatGPT, it wasn’t necessarily their primary assistant.
Participants were similarly satisfied with both tools (73% satisfied with
ChatGPT, vs. 78% with GitHub CoPilot). The highest satisfaction rate for any AI
assistant was Anthropic Claude, at 87%.</p>

<h3 id="team-challenges">Challenges for teams using Go</h3>
<p>In this section of the survey, we wanted to understand which best practices or
tools should be better integrated into developer workflows. Our approach was to
identify common problems for teams using Go. We then asked respondents which
challenges would bring them the most benefit if they were “magically” solved for
them. (This was so that respondents would not focus on particular solutions.)
Common problems that would provide the most benefit if they were solved would be
considered candidates for improvement.</p>
<p>The most commonly reported challenges for teams were maintaining consistent coding
standards across our Go codebase (58%), identifying performance issues in a
running Go program (58%) and identifying resource usage inefficiencies in a
running Go program (57%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_challenges.svg" alt= "Most common challenges for
teams" class="chart" /></p>
<p>21% of respondents said their team would benefit most from maintaining
consistent coding standards across their Go codebase. This was the most common
response, making it a good candidate to address. In a follow-up question, we got
more details as to why specifically this was so challenging.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_challenges_most_benefit.svg" alt= "Most benefit to
solve" class="chart" /></p>
<p>According to the write-in responses, many teams face challenges maintaining
consistent coding standards because their members have varying levels of
experience with Go and come from different programming backgrounds. This led to
inconsistencies in coding style and the adoption of non-idiomatic patterns.</p>
<p><em>“There&rsquo;s lots of polyglot engineers where I work. So the Go written is not
consistent. I do consider myself a Gopher and spend time trying to convince my
teammates what is idiomatic in Go”—Go developer with 2–4 years of experience.</em></p>
<p><em>“Most of the team members are learning Go from scratch. Coming from the
dynamically typed languages, it takes them a while to get used to the new
language. They seem to struggle maintaining the code consistency following the
Go guidelines.”—Go developer with 2–4 years of experience.</em></p>
<p>This echoes some feedback we’ve heard before about teammates who write &ldquo;Gava&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Guby&rdquo; due to their previous language experiences. Although static analysis was
a class of tool we had in mind to address this issue when we came up with this
question, we are currently exploring different ways we might address this.</p>
<h3 id="simd">Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)</h3>
<p>SIMD, or Single Instruction, Multiple Data, is a type of parallel processing
that allows a single CPU instruction to operate on multiple data points
simultaneously. This facilitates tasks involving large datasets and repetitive
operations, and is often used to optimize performance in fields like game
development, data processing, and scientific computing. In this section of the
survey we wanted to assess respondents&rsquo; needs for native SIMD support in Go.</p>
<p>The majority of respondents (89%) say that work on projects where performance
optimizations are crucial at least some of the time. 40% said they work on such
projects at least half the time. This held true across different organization
sizes and experience levels, suggesting that performance is an important issue
for most developers.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/perf_freq.svg" alt= "How often respondents work on
performance critical software" class="chart" /></p>
<p>About half of respondents (54%), said they are at least a little familiar with
the concept of SIMD. Working with SIMD often requires a deeper understanding of
computer architecture and low-level programming concepts, so unsurprisingly we
find that less experienced developers were less likely to be familiar with SIMD.
Respondents with more experience and who worked on performance-crucial
applications at least half the time were the most likely to be familiar with
SIMD.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/simd_fam.svg" alt= "Familiarity with SIMD" class="chart"
/></p>
<p>For those who were at least slightly familiar with SIMD, we asked some follow
-up questions to understand how respondents were affected by the absence of
native SIMD support in Go. Over a third, about 37%, said they had been impacted.
17% of respondents said they had been limited in the performance they could
achieve in their projects, 15% said they had to use another language instead of
Go to achieve their goals, and 13% said they had to use non-Go libraries when
they would have preferred to use Go libraries. Interestingly, respondents who
were negatively impacted by the absence of native SIMD support were a little
more likely to use Go for data processing and AI/ML. This suggests that adding
SIMD support could make Go a better option for these domains.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/simd_impact.svg" alt= "Impacts of lack of native Go support
for SIMD" class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/what_simd_impact.svg" alt=
"What impacted respondents build with Go" class="chart" /></p>
<h3 id="demographics">Demographics</h3>
<p>We ask similar demographic questions during each cycle of this survey so we can
understand how comparable the year-over-year results may be. For example, if we
saw changes in who responded to the survey in terms of Go experience, it’d be
very likely that other differences in results from prior cycles were due to this
demographic shift. We also use these questions to provide comparisons between
groups, such as satisfaction according to how long respondents have been using
Go.</p>
<p>We didn’t see any significant changes in levels of experience among respondents
during this cycle.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/go_exp.svg" alt= "Experience levels of respondents"
class="chart" /></p>
<p>There are differences in the demographics of respondents according to whether
they came from The Go Blog, the VS Code extension, or GoLand. The population
who responded to survey notifications in VS Code skews toward less experience
with Go; we suspect this a reflection of VS Code’s popularity with new Go
developers, who may not be ready to invest in an IDE license while they’re still
learning. With respect to years of Go experience, the respondents randomly
selected from GoLand are more similar to our self-selected population who found
the survey through the Go Blog. Seeing consistencies between samples allows us
to more confidently generalize findings to the rest of the community.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/go_exp_src.svg" alt= "Experience with Go by survey
source" class="chart" /></p>
<p>In addition to years of experience with Go, we also measured years of
professional coding experience. Our audience tends to be a pretty experienced
bunch, with 26% of respondents having 16 or more years of professional coding
experience.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_exp.svg" alt= "Overall levels of professional
developer experience" class="chart" /></p>
<p>The self-selected group was even more experienced than the randomly selected
groups, with 29% having 16 or more years of professional experience. This
suggests that our self-selected group is generally more experienced than our
randomly selected groups and can help explain some of the differences we see in
this group.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/dev_exp_src.svg" alt= "Levels of professional developer
experience by survey source" class="chart" /></p>
<p>We found that 81% of respondents were fully employed. When we look at our
individual samples, we see a small but significant difference within our
respondents from VS Code, who are slightly more likely to be students. This
makes sense given that VS Code is free.</p>
<img src="survey2024h2/employment.svg" alt= "Employment status" class="chart" />
<img src="survey2024h2/employment_src.svg" alt= "Employment status by survey
source" class="chart" />
<p>Similar to previous years, the most common use cases for Go were API/RPC
services (75%) and command line tools (62%). More experienced Go developers
reported building a wider variety of applications in Go. This trend was
consistent across every category of app or service. We did not find any notable
differences in what respondents are building based on their organization size.
Respondents from the random VS Code and GoLand samples did not display
significant differences either.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/what.svg" alt= "What respondents build with Go"
class="chart" /></p>
<h3 id="firmographics">Firmographics</h3>
<p>We heard from respondents at a variety of different organizations. About 29%
worked at large organizations with 1,001 or more employees, 25% were from
midsize organizations of 101–1,000 employees, and 43% worked at smaller
organizations with fewer than 100 employees. As in previous years, the most
common industry people work in was technology (43%) while the second most common
was financial services (13%).</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/org_size.svg" alt= "Organization sizes where respondents
work" class="chart" /> <img src="survey2024h2/industry.svg" alt= "Industries
respondents work in" class="chart" /></p>
<p>As in previous surveys, the most common location for survey respondents was the
United States (19%). This year we saw a significant shift in the proportion of
respondents coming from Ukraine, from 1% to 6%, making it the third most common
location for survey respondents. Because we only saw this difference among our
self-selected respondents, and not in the randomly sampled groups, this suggests
that something affected who discovered the survey, rather than a widespread
increase in Go adoption across all developers in Ukraine. Perhaps there was
increased visibility or awareness of the survey or the Go Blog among developers
in Ukraine.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/location.svg" alt= "Where respondents are located"
class="chart" /></p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>We announce the survey primarily through the Go Blog, where it is often picked
up on various social channels like Reddit, or Hacker News. We also recruit
respondents by using the VS Code Go plugin to randomly select users to whom we show
a prompt asking if they’d like to participate in the survey. With some help from
our friends at JetBrains, we also have an additional random sample from
prompting a random subset of GoLand users to take the survey. This gave us two
sources we used to compare the self-selected respondents from our traditional
channels and help identify potential effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-selection_bias" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">self-selection
bias</a>.</p>
<p>57% of survey respondents “self-selected” to take the survey, meaning they found
it on the Go blog or other social Go channels. People who don’t follow these
channels are less likely to learn about the survey from them, and in some cases,
they respond differently than people who do closely follow them. For example,
they might be new to the Go community and not yet aware of the Go blog. About
43% of respondents were randomly sampled, meaning they responded to the survey
after seeing a prompt in VS Code (25%) or GoLand (11%). Over the period of
September 9–23, 2024, there was roughly a 10% chance users of the VS Code plugin
would have seen this prompt. The prompt in GoLand was similarly active between
September 9–20. By examining how the randomly sampled groups differ from the
self-selected responses, as well as from each other, we’re able to more
confidently generalize findings to the larger community of Go developers.</p>
<p><img src="survey2024h2/source.svg" alt="Chart of different sources of survey
respondents" class="chart" /></p>
<h4 id="how-to-read-these-results">How to read these results</h4>
<p>Throughout this report we use charts of survey responses to provide supporting
evidence for our findings. All of these charts use a similar format. The title
is the exact question that survey respondents saw. Unless otherwise noted,
questions were multiple choice and participants could only select a single
response choice; each chart’s subtitle will tell the reader if the question
allowed multiple response choices or was an open-ended text box instead of a
multiple choice question. For charts of open-ended text responses, a Go team
member read and manually categorized all of the responses. Many open-ended
questions elicited a wide variety of responses; to keep the chart sizes
reasonable, we condensed them to a maximum of the top 10-12 themes, with
additional themes all grouped under “Other”. The percentage labels shown in
charts are rounded to the nearest integer (e.g., 1.4% and 0.8% will both be
displayed as 1%), but the length of each bar and row ordering are based on the
unrounded values.</p>
<p>To help readers understand the weight of evidence underlying each finding, we
included error bars showing the 95% <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">confidence
interval</a> for responses;
narrower bars indicate increased confidence. Sometimes two or more responses
have overlapping error bars, which means the relative order of those responses
is not statistically meaningful (i.e., the responses are effectively tied). The
lower right of each chart shows the number of people whose responses are
included in the chart, in the form “n = [number of respondents]”. In cases where
we found interesting differences in responses between groups, (e.g., years of
experience, organization size, or sample source) we showed a color-coded
breakdown of the differences.</p>

              <p>It's been a really busy month for Google as it apparently endeavors to outshine OpenAI with a blitz of AI releases. On Thursday, Google dropped its latest party trick: <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental</a>, which is a new AI model that uses runtime "reasoning" techniques similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/">OpenAI's o1</a> to achieve "deeper thinking" on problems fed into it.</p>
<p>The experimental model builds on Google's newly released <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and runs on its AI Studio platform, but early tests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">conducted</a> by TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers reveal accuracy issues with some basic tasks, such as incorrectly counting that the word "strawberry" contains two R's.</p>
<p>These so-called reasoning models differ from standard AI models by incorporating feedback loops of self-checking mechanisms, similar to techniques we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/hype-grows-over-autonomous-ai-agents-that-loop-gpt-4-outputs/">first saw in early 2023</a> with hobbyist projects like "Baby AGI." The process requires more computing time, often adding extra seconds or minutes to response times. Companies have turned to reasoning models as traditional scaling methods at training time have been showing diminishing returns.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>Another company has publicly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/">cut ties with Broadcom's VMware</a>. This time, it's Ingram Micro, one of the world's biggest IT distributors. The announcement comes as Broadcom eyes services as a key part of maintaining VMware business in 2025. But even as some customers are reducing reliance on VMware, its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/broadcom-rallies-forecast-booming-ai-chip-demand-2024-12-13/">trillion-dollar</a> owner is laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<h2>IT distributor severs VMware ties</h2>
<p>Ingram is reducing its Broadcom-related business to "limited engagement with VMware in select regions," a spokesperson told <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/16/ingram_micro_vmware_broadcom_deal_ends/">The Register</a> this week.</p>
<p>"We were unable to reach an agreement with Broadcom that would help our customers deliver the best technology outcomes now and in the future while providing an appropriate shareholder return,” the spokesperson said.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/as-firms-abandon-vmware-broadcom-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>On Thursday, a large group of university and private industry researchers unveiled <a href="https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io/">Genesis</a>, a new open source computer simulation system that lets robots practice tasks in simulated reality 430,000 times faster than in the real world. Researchers also plan to introduce an AI agent to generate 3D physics simulations from text prompts.</p>
<p>The accelerated simulation means a neural network for piloting robots can spend the virtual equivalent of decades learning to pick up objects, walk, or manipulate tools during just hours of real computer time.</p>
<p>"One hour of compute time gives a robot 10 years of training experience. That's how Neo was able to learn martial arts in a blink of an eye in the Matrix Dojo," <a href="https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1869795912597549137">wrote</a> Genesis paper co-author Jim Fan on X, who says he played a "minor part" in the research.

That George Washington owned enslaved people who were Muslim? And that a Muslim diplomat broke his Ramadan fast in the White House in 1805? These are some of the facts that Aymann Ismail (staff writer, Slate Magazine) discovers as he explores the role that Muslims played in the imagination of America’s founding generation. Aymann’s journey takes him from George Washington’s Mount Vernon to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello but begins in the Library of Congress. Here he sees two books that symbolize the promise and contradictions of the early Republic; Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’an and an autobiography written by an enslaved African Muslim, Omar Ibn Said, who was brought to the United States during Jefferson’s presidency.  Through these books, Ayman discovers how some Muslims were included in the founders’ vision of religious freedom in the nascent Republic, while other Muslims were denied all their rights, because of their race and legal status. 

The film features interviews with Keith Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress,) Denise A. Spellberg (author of Thomas Jefferson’s Qur’an: Islam and the Founders), and Jeffrey Einboden (author of Jefferson’s Muslim Fugitives: The Lost Story of Enslaved Africans, their Arabic Letters, and an American President).

American Muslims: A History Revealed
A series of six short documentary films that reveal and explore the early history of Muslims in America. The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric. Actors reading the part of historical characters include Hiam Abbas, David Rasche, Kamal Khan, and Faarshad Farahat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Discovery That Changed the Universe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vBpqY8PYsA</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:57:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What questions will we be asking 100 years from now?

              <p>The AI-generated video scene has been hopping this year (or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/twirling-body-horror-in-gymnastics-video-exposes-ais-flaws/">twirling wildly</a>, as the case may be). This past week alone we've seen releases or announcements of OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/ten-months-after-first-tease-openai-launches-sora-video-generation-publicly/">Sora</a>, Pika AI's <a href="https://pikartai.com/pika-2-0/">Pika 2</a>, Google's <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-2/">Veo 2</a>, and Minimax's <a href="https://x.com/fofrAI/status/1868763436974588222">video-01-live</a>. It's frankly hard to keep up, and even tougher to test them all. But recently, we put a new open-weights AI video synthesis model, Tencent's <a href="https://aivideo.hunyuan.tencent.com/">HunyuanVideo</a>, to the test—and it's surprisingly capable for being a "free" model.</p>
<p>Unlike the aforementioned models, HunyuanVideo's neural network weights are openly distributed, which means they can be run locally under the right circumstances (people have already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1h7hunp/how_to_run_hunyuanvideo_on_a_single_24gb_vram_card/">demonstrated it</a> on a consumer 24 GB VRAM GPU) and it can be fine-tuned or used with <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/LoRAs-explained">LoRAs</a> to teach it new concepts.</p>
<p>Notably, a few Chinese companies have been at the forefront of AI video for most of this year, and some experts speculate that the reason is less reticence to train on copyrighted materials, use images and names of famous celebrities, and incorporate some uncensored video sources. As we saw with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/ridiculed-stable-diffusion-3-release-excels-at-ai-generated-body-horror/">Stable Diffusion 3</a>'s mangled release, including nudity or pornography in training data may allow these models achieve better results by providing more information about human bodies. HunyuanVideo notably allows uncensored outputs, so unlike the commercial video models out there, it can generate videos of anatomically realistic, nude humans.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/a-new-uncensored-ai-video-model-may-spark-a-new-ai-hobbyist-movement/">Read full article</a></p>

While CPUs continue to accelerate, I/O operations remain bottlenecked by system call overhead, memory copy inefficiencies, and latency introduced by traditional synchronous models. For high-performance computing workloads, storage systems, and networking, this gap directly impacts scalability.</p><p>io_uring, introduced in Linux Kernel 5.1 by Jens Axboe, modernizes asynchronous I/O by eliminating unnecessary context switches, batching system calls, and enabling zero-copy operations between kernel and user space. Unlike its predecessors (epoll, linux-aio), io_uring achieves true zero-copy I/O between kernel and user space. This design is highly scalable, capable of handling millions of I/O operations per second while keeping CPU overhead minimal.</p><p>This article provides an exploration of io_uring, covering its architecture, core principles and practical usage.</p><h3>Who Should Use io_uring?</h3><p>io_uring is ideal for developers and engineers building applications requiring high-throughput, low-latency I/O. Its key beneficiaries include:</p><ul><li><strong>High-performance storage systems</strong>: Databases, filesystems, and analytics engines processing massive I/O workloads.</li><li><strong>Networking applications</strong>: Systems requiring low-latency and high-throughput socket I/O.</li><li><strong>High-performance computing (HPC)</strong>: Compute-intensive tasks requiring data pipelines optimized for minimal I/O stalls.</li><li><strong>Event-driven architectures</strong>: Software looking to unify I/O without thread pools or polling bottlenecks.</li></ul><p>In essence, any application where system call overhead, memory inefficiency, or scalability issues limit performance can benefit from io_uring.</p><h3>Context: Limitations of Existing I/O Models</h3><p>The foundational Linux I/O system calls — read, write, and their variants—are synchronous. They block execution until data is transferred, introducing latency and hindering concurrency in high-throughput applications. To achieve concurrency, applications often rely on thread pools or user-space scheduling, both of which come with their own complexities and inefficiencies.</p><p>Interfaces like select, poll, and epoll monitor file descriptors for readiness, allowing non-blocking operation on sockets. However, these interfaces do not work efficiently for file-based I/O and require additional system calls for data transfer.</p><p>Linux AIO (linux-aio) offered an asynchronous interface but suffered from several limitations:</p><ul><li>It supported only unbuffered (O_DIRECT) files, making it unsuitable for general-purpose applications.</li><li>Submissions could still block when accessing file metadata.</li><li>It lacked extensibility and struggled to integrate modern requirements like low-latency networking.</li></ul><h4>BSD and macOS I/O Models</h4><p>FreeBSD, by contrast, has <strong>kqueue</strong>, which provides an event notification mechanism for both sockets and files. macOS uses a similar interface since kqueue originated in BSD. While powerful, these interfaces still rely on readiness checks and require additional system calls to process I/O.</p><p>While OpenBSD enhances kqueue for predictability and reliability, its limitations persist. In contrast, io_uring reduces system call overhead and improves scalability, making it better suited for high-throughput workloads.</p><h4>Windows’ IOCP and Asynchronous Roots</h4><ul><li><strong>IOCP</strong> (I/O Completion Ports): Windows’ asynchronous I/O mechanism predates Linux solutions by decades. It delivers performance but lacks batching and zero-copy operations.</li><li><strong>I/O Rings</strong>: Recent Windows kernels now introduce IORING for improved capabilities, though they remain in early stages relative to io_uring.</li></ul><p>Unix systems historically avoided asynchronous I/O due to perceived complexity. Systems like VMS implemented efficient I/O decades earlier, influencing Windows NT’s IOCP. Legal concerns between Microsoft and DEC further stalled Unix advancements.</p><h3>Design: Ring Buffers and System Calls</h3><p>At its core, io_uring uses <strong>two shared-memory ring buffers</strong> to eliminate repeated syscalls:</p><ol><li><strong>Submission Queue (SQ)</strong>: User-space enqueues I/O requests.</li><li><strong>Completion Queue (CQ)</strong>: Kernel posts I/O completion results.</li></ol><p>Unlike epoll, where event readiness still requires polling, io_uring enables direct notification and retrieval through memory-mapped rings.</p><h4>Submission Queue (SQ)</h4><p>The SQ contains indices referencing <strong>Submission Queue Entries (SQEs)</strong>, which describe the I/O requests. Each SQE specifies the operation type, file descriptor, buffer, and other parameters. After filling in an SQE, the application pushes its index to the SQ ring, notifying the kernel to process it.</p><h4>Completion Queue (CQ)</h4><p>Once the kernel completes an I/O operation, it places the result in the CQ. The application consumes the results by reading from the CQ ring without making an additional system call.</p><p>By decoupling submission and completion, io_uring achieves asynchronous operation without blocking the application thread.</p><p>io_uring relies on a minimal set of system calls:</p><ul><li><strong>io_uring_setup</strong>: Initializes the io_uring instance.</li><li><strong>io_uring_enter</strong>: Submits SQEs to the kernel and optionally waits for completions.</li><li><strong>io_uring_register</strong>: Registers buffers, file descriptors, and other resources for efficient reuse.</li></ul><h3>Practical Usage of io_uring</h3><p>For higher-level languages like <strong>Go</strong>, accessing io_uring typically involves libraries or bindings that wrap the underlying C interface.</p><h4>Steps to Use io_uring</h4><ol><li><strong>Initialization</strong>: The application sets up the io_uring instance, mapping the SQ, CQ, and SQE array into user-space memory.</li><li><strong>Batch Submission</strong>: I/O requests are added to the SQE array and indexed in the SQ ring.</li><li><strong>Kernel Notification</strong>: A call to io_uring_enter submits the queued requests.</li><li><strong>Completion Handling</strong>: The application polls the CQ ring for results and processes completed operations.</li></ol><p>Using io_uring removes the need for thread pools, readiness checks, and blocking system calls, making it a natural fit for event-loop architectures. Advanced io_uring features further enhance performance and flexibility:</p><ul><li><strong>Fixed Buffers and Files</strong>: Pre-register buffers to reduce mapping overhead.</li><li><strong>Linked Operations</strong>: Chain SQEs with IOSQE_IO_LINK for atomic, dependent tasks.</li><li><strong>Timeout Support</strong>: Manage operation expirations via IORING_OP_TIMEOUT.</li></ul><h3>io_uring and High-Performance Computing (HPC)</h3><p>In HPC environments, where <a href="https://medium.com/@kyodo-tech/6ec8340c38e9"><strong>I/O performance directly affects overall throughput</strong></a> , io_uring offers several critical benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduced Data Motion</strong>: Zero-copy operations minimize CPU involvement in memory transfers, improving energy efficiency and bandwidth utilization.</li><li><strong>Batch Submission</strong>: I/O requests are submitted in batches, reducing kernel-user transitions.</li><li><strong>Polling for Ultra-Low Latency</strong>: Kernel-side polling (SQPOLL) eliminates interrupt delays for storage and networking devices.</li><li><strong>Low-Latency File and Socket I/O</strong>: For HPC tasks involving storage access (e.g., checkpointing, data persistence) or real-time networking, io_uring’s batched submission and completion handling reduce syscall-induced latency.</li><li><strong>High IOPS Scalability</strong>: io_uring efficiently handles millions of I/O operations per second, scaling well on multi-core processors.</li></ul><p>These features allow HPC systems to bridge the gap between CPU performance and I/O bandwidth.</p><h3>Performance Considerations</h3><p>Benchmarking io_uring reveals measurable improvements over existing I/O models. For storage workloads using Direct I/O, it achieves nearly <strong>twice the throughput</strong> of synchronous reads and POSIX AIO while reducing context switch overhead.</p><p>For buffered I/O workloads (e.g., accessing the page cache), io_uring matches the performance of synchronous reads without blocking or requiring thread pools.</p><h4>io_uring in Containerized Environments</h4><p>In containerized environments, such as Kubernetes, io_uring requires additional consideration of the deployment architecture. Containerization introduces abstraction layers—such as overlay filesystems and distributed storage—that can hinder the direct performance benefits.</p><p>Kubernetes distributions should be paired with direct storage mechanisms such as hostPath volumes or raw block device mounts to preserve performance advantages. Running containers in privileged mode or with elevated capabilities (e.g., CAP_SYS_ADMIN) can be beneficial, as io_uring relies on advanced kernel features that may be restricted in default Kubernetes environments. Privileged mode ensures the container can access necessary low-level system functions, bypass namespace isolation overhead, and directly interact with host storage devices, enabling io_uring to deliver its intended performance benefits. This makes io_uring viable even within orchestrated workloads, particularly for high-throughput and latency-sensitive applications.</p><h3>Comparative Landscape</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IYmTME7XFZoyfWfVE5IEnQ.png" /></figure><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Compared to alternatives like kqueue on BSD systems, io_uring delivers superior scalability and flexibility. As tooling and libraries continue to evolve, io_uring will become the de-facto standard for performance-critical I/O on Linux.</p><p>Developers seeking to maximize modern hardware performance will find io_uring a clean, efficient, and scalable solution to today’s I/O bottlenecks.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=047d5b1a9944" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What happens when you unfold this 100 year old Xmas card?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlNR7NsAy9I</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:00:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#iwm #history #christmas #iwmxmasshorts #ww1]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Vulkan Graphics API with Tom Olson and Ralph Potter</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/12/19/the-vulkan-graphics-api-with-tom-olson-and-ralph-potter/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-vulkan-graphics-api-with-tom-olson-and-ralph-potter</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a> is a low-level graphics API designed to provide developers with more direct control over the GPU, reducing overhead and enabling high performance in applications like games, simulations, and visualizations. It addresses the inefficiencies of older APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D and helps solve issues with cross-platform compatibility.</p>

This catchy, musical short chronicles the arbitrary system of race in the United States, which kept people who were not white and male in an ongoing battle of identity. See how immigrants had to play "race roulette" with a biased court system due to the Alien Naturalization Act of 1790, which set the standard for citizenship in America and remained law for 175 years.

The first movie was a nice little diversion from COVID, but the sequel was quite irritating--and with the same director and writers back for another go-around, I figured we were in for another round of "more of the same." Fortunately for all of us, I was wrong: The threequel successfully reins in the pop culture references and Jim Carrey's wackiness just enough, while also giving us a serious villain for the first time with Keanu Reeves's Shadow, and the result is that Sonic the Hedgehog 3 works better for audiences of all ages than its predecessors, which were more squarely aimed at children.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic 3 picks up some time after the last movie, and the Wachowskis have adopted Tails and Knuckles along with Sonic--they've got a nice little family unit going. Robotnik, meanwhile, is very depressed, just hanging out in his crab mech binge-eating snacks and binge-watching telenovelas. In other words, all is well. At least until an unknown person manages to free the mysterious Shadow the Hedgehog from stasis, letting him loose to pursue revenge for something that happened long ago and putting him into conflict with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.</p><p dir="ltr">That unknown person was, it turns out, another Dr. Robotnik--grandpa to the one we know (but still played by Jim Carrey). Robotnik Sr. and Shadow are allies, having shared a deep trauma decades earlier that is driving them both to extreme lengths for revenge. The younger Robotnik, the one who was a bad guy in the other two movies, serves as a wild card, because he wants to team up with his grandad but has a pretty different ultimate goal.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Young People Are in So Much Debt</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjAXWAp0S0s</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2024 20:19:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s not all in your head.

How Gen Z Ended Up in So Much Debt 👉 https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-31/why-gen-z-is-sinking-deeper-into-debt-explained

Younger Americans face a financial crisis. Their growing debt burden has far outpaced that of older generations, and it’s only getting worse. Generation Z is being hit the hardest, thanks to lower income and the rising cost of everything from food to housing. Bloomberg takes a look at the roots of this problem, and whether anything can be done.

<p>If you haven't been following along, the crux of the issue is Qualcomm's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/qualcomm-closes-nuvia-deal-promises-in-house-laptop-cpus-by-2h-2022/">purchase</a> of a chip design firm called Nuvia in 2021. Nuvia was originally founded by ex-Apple chip designers to create high-performance Arm chips for servers, but Qualcomm took an interest in Nuvia's work and acquired the company to help it create high-end Snapdragon processors for consumer PCs instead. Arm claims that this was a violation of its licensing agreements with Nuvia and is seeking to have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/arm-sues-qualcomm-over-its-1-4-billion-nuvia-acquisition/">all chips based on Nuvia technology destroyed</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/arm-qualcomm-trial-set-begin-over-chip-contract-dispute-2024-12-16/">According to Reuters</a>, Arm CEO Rene Haas testified this week that the Nuvia acquisition is depriving Arm of about $50 million a year, on top of the roughly $300 million a year in fees that Qualcomm already pays Arm to use its instruction set and some elements of its chip designs. This is because Qualcomm pays Arm lower royalty rates than Nuvia had agreed to pay when it was still an independent company.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/arm-and-qualcomm-fight-in-court-over-the-future-of-snapdragon-x-elite-chips/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>On Wednesday, OpenAI launched a 1-800-CHATGPT (1-800-242-8478) telephone number that anyone in the US can call to talk to ChatGPT via voice chat for up to 15 minutes for free. The company also says that people outside the US can send text messages to the same number for free using WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Upon calling, users hear a voice say, "Hello again, it's ChatGPT, an AI assistant. Our conversation may be reviewed for safety. How can I help you?" Callers can ask ChatGPT anything they would normally ask the AI assistant and have a live, interactive conversation.</p>
<p>During a livestream demo of "Calling with ChatGPT" during Day 10 of "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openai-teases-12-days-of-mystery-product-launches-starting-tomorrow/">12 Days of OpenAI</a>," OpenAI employees demonstrated several examples of the telephone-based voice chat in action, asking ChatGPT to identify a distinctive house in California and for help in translating a message into Spanish for a friend.

This video is presented by Destination Vancouver. Learn more about Vancouver at findyourrefresh.com. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

Movie magic is what makes our favorite films so good: Actors flawlessly inhabiting the personalities of totally made-up characters, visual effects transforming a green screen to an otherworldly setting, musical scores making us feel every emotion under the sun. But there’s another kind of magic we don’t talk about as much: one physical location masquerading as another. And it happens all the time.

When filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn’t as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. 

All these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. 

This is especially true for holiday movies — many of which are filmed in Canada. In this video, we talk to a prolific Christmas movie producer — who has worked on films like 2024’s Netflix hit Hot Frosty — about shooting movies in Canada. 

Correction: In a previous version of this video we mistakenly said that Clark Kent's farm in the TV show Smallville was in Kentucky at :58 and 1:13. The Kent family farm was actually in Kansas. We've corrected the error.

They took control within a matter of weeks. But the country was about to descend into chaos.

What started as an insurgency would soon turn into an all-out sectarian civil war. One that would take hundreds of Iraqi lives every day. But it didn’t have to be this way. 

The violence in Iraq was not inevitable, it was caused by a myriad of mistakes. Why did the Iraqi people turn against the Coalition? What caused the Civil War? And where did Coalition forces actually succeed?

Using objects, film and photography from the IWM collection IWM Curator Jack Gelsthorpe takes an in-depth look at the Coalition Occupation from 2003 to 2011 in effort to understand what went wrong in Iraq?

<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>ncus and Docker both use Linux kernel features to containerize your applications. Incus is best suited when you need system-level containers that act like traditional VMs and provide a persistent developer experience. On the other hand, Docker containers are ephemeral, i.e., temporary in nature. All files created inside Docker containers are lost when your Docker container is stopped or removed unless you stored them using volumes in different directories outside Docker. Docker is created as a disposable app deployment system. Incus containers are not typically created as disposables, and data is kept inside when they are stopped. Because of the Linux kernel support nesting feature, you can run Docker inside Incus. This page explains how to run Docker inside Incus containers.</p>

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

In August 2023, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century reduced much of the Hawaiian town of Lahaina to ashes, killing more than 100 people and displacing thousands. Coming in the wake of a state investigation that found a broad cascade of failures, “Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” investigates critical missteps that day — and in the years prior, as the county and state were repeatedly advised to invest more money in prevention and preparedness, and as experts and residents raised concerns.

The documentary draws on harrowing footage filmed by those in the path of the inferno and firsthand accounts from survivors, victims’ families and friends, first responders, and local and state authorities. Through these accounts as well as a detailed analysis of over a thousand 911 calls and public records across multiple government agencies, it provides a wrenching, moment-by-moment reconstruction of the fire and its aftermath. 

The film also examines how changes to the climate and landscape have made Maui increasingly vulnerable to fires and raises difficult questions about what led to the fire’s heavy toll.

“Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” is a FRONTLINE production with Mandarin Duck Films LLC. The writer, producer and director is Xinyan Yu. The producer is Christina Avalos. The senior producer is Frank Koughan. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

<p>Volume group snapshots were <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/05/08/kubernetes-1-27-volume-group-snapshot-alpha/">introduced</a>
as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release.
The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to <strong>beta</strong>.
The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of
<a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/group-snapshot-restore-feature.html#volume-group-snapshot-apis">extension APIs for group snapshots</a>.
These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes.
Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims
for snapshotting.
A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and
recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.</p>
<p>This new feature is only supported for <a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/">CSI</a> volume drivers.</p>
<h2 id="an-overview-of-volume-group-snapshots">An overview of volume group snapshots</h2>
<p>Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents <em>copies</em> made from multiple volumes, that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).</p>
<h2 id="why-add-volume-group-snapshots-to-kubernetes">Why add volume group snapshots to Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>The Kubernetes volume plugin system already provides a powerful abstraction that
automates the provisioning, attaching, mounting, resizing, and snapshotting of block
and file storage.</p>
<p>Underpinning all these features is the Kubernetes goal of workload portability:
Kubernetes aims to create an abstraction layer between distributed applications and
underlying clusters so that applications can be agnostic to the specifics of the
cluster they run on and application deployment requires no cluster specific knowledge.</p>
<p>There was already a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/">VolumeSnapshot</a> API
that provides the ability to take a snapshot of a persistent volume to protect against
data loss or data corruption. However, there are other snapshotting functionalities
not covered by the VolumeSnapshot API.</p>
<p>Some storage systems support consistent group snapshots that allow a snapshot to be
taken from multiple volumes at the same point-in-time to achieve write order consistency.
This can be useful for applications that contain multiple volumes. For example,
an application may have data stored in one volume and logs stored in another volume.
If snapshots for the data volume and the logs volume are taken at different times,
the application will not be consistent and will not function properly if it is restored
from those snapshots when a disaster strikes.</p>
<p>It is true that you can quiesce the application first, take an individual snapshot from
each volume that is part of the application one after the other, and then unquiesce the
application after all the individual snapshots are taken. This way, you would get
application consistent snapshots.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the application quiesce can be so time consuming that you want to do it less frequently,
or it may not be possible to quiesce an application at all.
For example, a user may want to run weekly backups with application quiesce
and nightly backups without application quiesce but with consistent group support which
provides crash consistency across all volumes in the group.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-apis-for-volume-group-snapshots">Kubernetes APIs for volume group snapshots</h2>
<p>Kubernetes' support for <em>volume group snapshots</em> relies on three API kinds that
are used
for managing snapshots:</p>
<dl>
<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshot</dt>
<dd>Created by a Kubernetes user (or perhaps by your own automation) to request
creation of a volume group snapshot for multiple persistent volume claims.
It contains information about the volume group snapshot operation such as the
timestamp when the volume group snapshot was taken and whether it is ready to use.
The creation and deletion of this object represents a desire to create or delete a
cluster resource (a group snapshot).</dd>
<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotContent</dt>
<dd>Created by the snapshot controller for a dynamically created VolumeGroupSnapshot.
It contains information about the volume group snapshot including the volume group
snapshot ID.
This object represents a provisioned resource on the cluster (a group snapshot).
The VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object binds to the VolumeGroupSnapshot for which it
was created with a one-to-one mapping.</dd>
<dt>VolumeGroupSnapshotClass</dt>
<dd>Created by cluster administrators to describe how volume group snapshots should be
created, including the driver information, the deletion policy, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These three API kinds are defined as
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">CustomResourceDefinitions</a>
(CRDs).
These CRDs must be installed in a Kubernetes cluster for a CSI Driver to support
volume group snapshots.</p>
<h2 id="what-components-are-needed-to-support-volume-group-snapshots">What components are needed to support volume group snapshots</h2>
<p>Volume group snapshots are implemented in the
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter">external-snapshotter</a> repository.
Implementing volume group snapshots meant adding or changing several components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new CustomResourceDefinitions for VolumeGroupSnapshot and two supporting APIs.</li>
<li>Volume group snapshot controller logic is added to the common snapshot controller.</li>
<li>Adding logic to make CSI calls into the snapshotter sidecar controller.</li>
</ul>
<p>The volume snapshot controller and CRDs are deployed once per
cluster, while the sidecar is bundled with each CSI driver.</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes sense to deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as a cluster addon.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes project recommends that Kubernetes distributors
bundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part
of their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new-in-beta">What's new in Beta?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The VolumeGroupSnapshot feature in CSI spec moved to GA in the <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.11.0">v1.11.0 release</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The snapshot validation webhook was deprecated in external-snapshotter v8.0.0 and it is now removed.
Most of the validation webhook logic was added as validation rules into the CRDs.
Minimum required Kubernetes version is 1.25 for these validation rules.
One thing in the validation webhook not moved to CRDs is the prevention of creating
multiple default volume snapshot classes and multiple default volume group snapshot classes
for the same CSI driver.
With the removal of the validation webhook, an error will still be raised when dynamically
provisioning a VolumeSnapshot or VolumeGroupSnapshot when multiple default volume snapshot
classes or multiple default volume group snapshot classes for the same CSI driver exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>enable-volumegroup-snapshot</code> flag in the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter
sidecar has been replaced by a feature gate.
Since VolumeGroupSnapshot is a new API, the feature moves to Beta but the feature gate is
disabled by default.
To use this feature, enable the feature gate by adding the flag <code>--feature-gates=CSIVolumeGroupSnapshot=true</code>
when starting the snapshot-controller and the CSI snapshotter sidecar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The logic to dynamically create the VolumeGroupSnapshot and its corresponding individual
VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent objects are moved from the CSI snapshotter to the common
snapshot-controller.
New RBAC rules are added to the common snapshot-controller and some RBAC rules are removed from
the CSI snapshotter sidecar accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-kubernetes-volume-group-snapshots">How do I use Kubernetes volume group snapshots</h2>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-group-snapshot-with-kubernetes">Creating a new group snapshot with Kubernetes</h3>
<p>Once a VolumeGroupSnapshotClass object is defined and you have volumes you want to
snapshot together, you may request a new group snapshot by creating a VolumeGroupSnapshot
object.</p>
<p>The source of the group snapshot specifies whether the underlying group snapshot
should be dynamically created or if a pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent
should be used.</p>
<p>A pre-existing VolumeGroupSnapshotContent is created by a cluster administrator.
It contains the details of the real volume group snapshot on the storage system which
is available for use by cluster users.</p>
<p>One of the following members in the source of the group snapshot must be set.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>selector</code> - a label query over PersistentVolumeClaims that are to be grouped
together for snapshotting. This selector will be used to match the label
added to a PVC.</li>
<li><code>volumeGroupSnapshotContentName</code> - specifies the name of a pre-existing
VolumeGroupSnapshotContent object representing an existing volume group snapshot.</li>
</ul>

<p>To implement the volume group snapshot feature, a CSI driver <strong>must</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a new group controller service.</li>
<li>Implement group controller RPCs: <code>CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>, <code>DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>, and <code>GetVolumeGroupSnapshot</code>.</li>
<li>Add group controller capability <code>CREATE_DELETE_GET_VOLUME_GROUP_SNAPSHOT</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md">CSI spec</a>
and the <a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/">Kubernetes-CSI Driver Developer Guide</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it is strongly recommended that Kubernetes distributors
bundle and deploy the volume snapshot controller and CRDs as part
of their Kubernetes cluster management process (independent of any CSI Driver).</p>
<p>As part of this recommended deployment process, the Kubernetes team provides a number of
sidecar (helper) containers, including the
<a href="https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/external-snapshotter.html">external-snapshotter sidecar container</a>
which has been updated to support volume group snapshot.</p>
<p>The external-snapshotter watches the Kubernetes API server for
VolumeGroupSnapshotContent objects, and triggers <code>CreateVolumeGroupSnapshot</code> and
<code>DeleteVolumeGroupSnapshot</code> operations against a CSI endpoint.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-limitations">What are the limitations?</h2>
<p>The beta implementation of volume group snapshots for Kubernetes has the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not support reverting an existing PVC to an earlier state represented by
a snapshot (only supports provisioning a new volume from a snapshot).</li>
<li>No application consistency guarantees beyond any guarantees provided by the storage system
(e.g. crash consistency). See this <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/30d06f49fba22273f31b3c616b74cf8745c19b3d/wg-data-protection/data-protection-workflows-white-paper.md#quiesce-and-unquiesce-hooks">doc</a>
for more discussions on application consistency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes project plans to push the volume
group snapshot implementation to general availability (GA) in a future release.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-learn-more">How can I learn more?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3476-volume-group-snapshot">design spec</a>

Could we create warp drive someday? In this Star Trek-themed episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice team up with astrophysicist Charles Liu to dive into the science, technology, and legacy of one of the most influential sci-fi franchises of all time: Star Trek.

We answer questions about quantum entanglement, the size of electrons, and the real science behind Trek tech or Treknology. How close are we to warp drives, transporters, and subspace communication? You might be surprised to hear what’s theoretically possible and what remains in the realm of science fiction.

We discuss technology that exists already and the solutions to storytelling challenges through warp drives and dilithium crystals. Learn about the show’s physics, from phasers and antimatter to the mycelium network’s fascinating parallels with fungal biology. How do you store antimatter without it annihilating? Plus, find out who everyone’s favorite characters are and who they relate to most. 

As we reflect on the series’ 23rd-century vision, we ask: Could humanity achieve Trek-level tech by 2260? We discuss the physics we’re missing and the collective imagination and determination it takes to advance our understanding of the universe.

Domino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua "Alex" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.

// Abstract
Given the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.

--

Charles Darwin introduced the notion of “survival of the fittest,” where the fittest animals are those who can survive long enough to produce healthy offspring. The fittest animal can also be the most stealthy, resourceful, or even the most cooperative. So what exactly does cooperation look like in the wild? Ashley Ward digs into the animal kingdom's capacity for generosity.

However, the network’s performance advantages demand substantial hardware and networking resources, creating significant <strong>decentralization barriers</strong>. In the following, we try to understand key bottlenecks and reviewing solutions explored by projects like <a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/firedancer/"><strong>Firedancer</strong></a> (C++), <a href="https://overclock.one/rnd/unveiling-mithril"><strong>Mithril</strong></a> (Go), <a href="https://blog.syndica.io/introducing-sig-by-syndica-an-rps-focused-solana-validator-client-written-in-zig/"><strong>Sig</strong></a> (Zig) for simplifying Solana’s core protocol.</p><h3>Barriers to Solana Node Accessibility</h3><p>As of November 2024, Solana validator nodes require high-end infrastructure to manage the network’s demanding workloads. These requirements include:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: Multi-core processors like AMD EPYC with ideally 24 cores and AVX512 support. These CPUs handle Turbine packet routing, Proof of History (PoH) computation, and the execution of transactions in real time which are compute bound.</li><li><strong>Memory</strong>: At least 512 GB of RAM is essential to manage the growing AccountsDB, which holds all account states and balances. The memory also supports maintaining multiple forks during optimistic execution.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: Dual enterprise-grade NVMe drives (2 x 1.92 TB or more) provide the speed and capacity needed for ledger growth and the high disk IO required by validator operations.</li><li><strong>Networking</strong>: A robust connection with a minimum upload speed of 1 Gbps and traffic capacity exceeding 100 TB per month to handle Turbine traffic, gossip communication, and repair requests.</li></ul><p>These stringent requirements, while ensuring high performance, concentrate validator operations within professional data centers. This reliance reduces the diversity of node operators, potentially impacting network decentralization and resilience.</p><h4>Operational Complexity</h4><p>The validator’s role extends beyond simple data propagation, encompassing several computationally intensive tasks:</p><ul><li><strong>Transaction Ingress and Filtering</strong>: Validators receive transactions over the QUIC protocol, verify ED25519 cryptographic signatures, and pack transactions into <strong>shreds</strong> (small, fixed-size data packets used for efficient network dissemination).</li><li><strong>Real-Time Execution</strong>: Validators optimistically execute unconfirmed blocks in parallel while maintaining multiple forks in memory. This enables low-latency transaction processing but demands substantial computational resources.</li><li><strong>Consensus Participation</strong>: Validators implement the TowerBFT protocol to finalize the canonical chain by pruning unneeded forks and aligning with the majority stake.</li></ul><p>This complexity requires specialized knowledge and resources, which limit participation to organizations with significant technical and financial capabilities.</p><h3>Refining Execution Models for Efficiency</h3><p>Solana’s optimistic execution model emphasizes speed but comes with high resource demands. Rethinking execution priorities can reduce these demands while preserving network functionality:</p><h4>Focusing on Confirmed Blocks</h4><p>Nodes focused on verification can prioritize blocks that have achieved a supermajority consensus of 67% validator stake. Ignoring unconfirmed forks reduces memory usage and CPU overhead while maintaining alignment with the canonical chain. This approach aligns with blockchain fundamentals, focusing on deterministic state rather than speculative execution.</p><h4>Batch-Based Execution</h4><p>Batch processing transactions reduces the computational burden of handling each transaction individually. Larger batch windows amortize costs over more transactions, enabling lagging nodes to catch up more efficiently. Techniques like staged synchronization, as implemented in Ethereum’s Erigon client, offer valuable insights for optimizing this process. By aggregating multiple blocks or transactions into larger processing units, nodes can reduce their dependency on high-speed, low-latency operations.</p><h4>Streamlining Bank Management</h4><p>The <strong>Solana bank</strong> is a system that tracks account states and balances across multiple forks. It is integral to the ledger’s functionality, maintaining a live view of the network’s economic state. Pruning redundant forks and offloading older data to disk minimizes memory usage. Efficient selective retrieval ensures that only the necessary data is kept active, reducing the operational footprint. Introducing hierarchical caching mechanisms further enhances this optimization by reducing IO latency for frequently accessed data.</p><h3>Optimizing Networking and Block Propagation</h3><h4>Snapshot-Based Initialization</h4><p>To bootstrap quickly, nodes can download a verified snapshot of the blockchain state, which is a compressed representation of all account balances and programs at a specific point in time. This eliminates the need to process the entire blockchain history during initialization, significantly reducing bandwidth and time requirements. Snapshots also reduce trust assumptions since they can be cryptographically verified against multiple sources, ensuring data integrity.</p><h4>Efficient Turbine Handling</h4><p>Turbine, Solana’s protocol for disseminating shreds, ensures rapid propagation but is bandwidth-intensive. Verification-focused nodes can bypass Turbine by fetching complete blocks directly from trusted peers or <strong>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</strong> services. RPC services are interfaces that allow developers and decentralized applications (dApps) to query blockchain data or submit transactions programmatically. For example, a wallet application might use an RPC endpoint to display user account balances or simulate transaction outcomes. By streamlining RPC interactions and incorporating compression techniques, nodes can minimize data transfer overhead.</p><h4>Repair Requests and Consolidated Bundling</h4><p>Nodes can issue repair requests to fetch missing shreds from the network. Consolidating multiple blocks into single packets during these requests reduces the number of network round trips, optimizing bandwidth usage and synchronization speed. This bundling approach is particularly useful during initial synchronization or periods of high network congestion.</p><h4>Proof of History Optimizations</h4><p><strong>Proof of History (PoH)</strong> is a mechanism that creates a verifiable timeline of events by chaining cryptographic hashes. Each hash depends on the previous one, ensuring that events are ordered and timestamps are reliable. PoH enables fast synchronization and leader scheduling, but its computational demands can be optimized for non-validator nodes:</p><h4>Bypassing PoH Generation</h4><p>Nodes that do not produce blocks can disable the generation of new PoH sequences, which involves grinding SHA-256 hashes continuously. Disabling this frees up CPU cores for other tasks without compromising the node’s ability to validate the chain. By relegating PoH verification to a parallelized task, non-validator nodes can further reduce latency.</p><h4>Leveraging Kernel-Bypass Networking</h4><p>Inspired by Jump Crypto’s Firedancer project, nodes can employ kernel-bypass techniques for networking. By bypassing the operating system’s kernel, network packets are processed directly by the application, reducing latency. Additionally, <strong>Firedancer’s AVX-512-optimized signature verification</strong> accelerates cryptographic operations like ED25519 signature checks. AVX-512 is a vectorized instruction set that processes multiple cryptographic signatures simultaneously, dramatically increasing transaction processing rates and reducing CPU bottlenecks. These enhancements ensure that even resource-constrained nodes can sustain high throughput.</p><h3>Enhancing Ledger and RPC Infrastructure</h3><h4>Ledger Compression Techniques</h4><p>The Solana ledger grows rapidly, necessitating efficient storage solutions. Delta encoding, which records only the changes in account states between blocks, reduces storage requirements significantly. Compaction strategies, such as merging older states, further optimize storage without compromising query performance. These optimizations are critical for maintaining the ledger’s accessibility on consumer-grade hardware.</p><h4>Simplified RPC Design</h4><p>RPC nodes often face high memory demands due to the need for real-time data indexing. Simplifying the RPC infrastructure can alleviate these pressures:</p><ul><li><strong>Basic Query Support</strong>: Implementing efficient account balance and transaction history lookups reduces overhead.</li><li><strong>Optimized Indices</strong>: Using disk-based lookup tables instead of memory-intensive indices balances performance and resource usage.</li><li><strong>Transaction Submission</strong>: Lightweight mechanisms for forwarding transactions ensure scalability without redundancy.</li></ul><h4>Remote Verification Tools</h4><p>Lightweight clients enable users to verify blockchain data securely without running full nodes. Incorporating trust-minimized mechanisms, such as fraud-proof or zero-knowledge systems, ensures that users can validate data independently with minimal resource requirements. These light clients build upon foundational ideas from Bitcoin’s Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets, which utilized bloom filters for efficient transaction monitoring. Although Solana’s model diverges in implementation, the underlying goal of reducing resource needs for trustless verification remains consistent.</p><h3>Reducing Bandwidth Costs for Decentralization</h3><h4>Alternative Block Fetching Methods</h4><p>Gossip-based block propagation is bandwidth-intensive. Nodes can reduce costs by fetching blocks directly from RPC endpoints or trusted sources, avoiding redundant transmissions. Optional compression or erasure coding for data packets further optimizes block transfers. Adopting batch-based repair systems enhances the efficiency of large-scale synchronization efforts.</p><h4>Insights from Firedancer</h4><p>Jump Crypto’s Firedancer initiative demonstrates the potential of optimizing Solana’s software stack to push hardware to its limits. Key advancements include:</p><ul><li><strong>Kernel-Bypass Networking</strong>: Firedancer’s implementation of high-performance QUIC and Turbine networking eliminates bottlenecks caused by traditional OS-level networking.</li><li><strong>Optimized Block Packing</strong>: Efficient logic for shred assembly reduces processing latency, ensuring faster transaction finalization.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Diversifying the validator codebase with an independent implementation minimizes systemic risks and improves the network’s robustness.</li></ul><p>Firedancer’s modular approach, exemplified by its Frankendancer deployment, offers a roadmap for incrementally integrating high-performance components into the Solana ecosystem.</p><h3>Towards Broader Participation</h3><p>Solana’s architectural evolution must focus on reducing operational barriers for all participants. By optimizing execution models, networking protocols, and storage systems, the network can achieve broader decentralization without compromising its high-performance standards. Innovations like Firedancer and targeted efficiency improvements provide a clear path to a more accessible and resilient Solana network.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=36f1df3e7efb" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stephen Curry On His Under Armour Brand</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9u70IjXf5c0</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:07:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When Stephen Curry left Nike for Under Armour, he took a risk.

<p>Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing.
A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by <strong>list</strong> requests.</p>
<p>In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes <strong>list</strong> requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client.
But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple <strong>list</strong> requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage.
While <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API Priority and Fairness</a> has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection.
This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded.
This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let's consider the below graph.</p>
<figure class="diagram-large clickable-zoom">
<img src="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/12/17/kube-apiserver-api-streaming/kube-apiserver-memory_usage.png"
alt="Monitoring graph showing kube-apiserver memory usage"/>
</figure>
<p>The graph shows the memory usage of a kube-apiserver during a synthetic test.
(see the <a href="#the-synthetic-test">synthetic test</a> section for more details).
The results clearly show that increasing the number of informers significantly boosts the server's memory consumption.
Notably, at approximately 16:40, the server crashed when serving only 16 informers.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-kube-apiserver-allocate-so-much-memory-for-list-requests">Why does kube-apiserver allocate so much memory for list requests?</h2>
<p>Our investigation revealed that this substantial memory allocation occurs because the server before sending the first byte to the client must:</p>
<ul>
<li>fetch data from the database,</li>
<li>deserialize the data from its stored format,</li>
<li>and finally construct the final response by converting and serializing the data into a client requested format</li>
</ul>
<p>This sequence results in significant temporary memory consumption.
The actual usage depends on many factors like the page size, applied filters (e.g. label selectors), query parameters, and sizes of individual objects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API Priority and Fairness</a> nor Golang's garbage collection or Golang memory limits can prevent the system from exhausting memory under these conditions.
The memory is allocated suddenly and rapidly, and just a few requests can quickly deplete the available memory, leading to resource exhaustion.</p>
<p>Depending on how the API server is run on the node, it might either be killed through OOM by the kernel when exceeding the configured memory limits during these uncontrolled spikes, or if limits are not configured it might have even worse impact on the control plane node.
And worst, after the first API server failure, the same requests will likely hit another control plane node in an HA setup with probably the same impact.
Potentially a situation that is hard to diagnose and hard to recover from.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-list-requests">Streaming list requests</h2>
<p>Today, we're excited to announce a major improvement.
With the graduation of the <em>watch list</em> feature to beta in Kubernetes 1.32, client-go users can opt-in (after explicitly enabling <code>WatchListClient</code> feature gate)
to streaming lists by switching from <strong>list</strong> to (a special kind of) <strong>watch</strong> requests.</p>
<p><strong>Watch</strong> requests are served from the <em>watch cache</em>, an in-memory cache designed to improve scalability of read operations.
By streaming each item individually instead of returning the entire collection, the new method maintains constant memory overhead.
The API server is bound by the maximum allowed size of an object in etcd plus a few additional allocations.
This approach drastically reduces the temporary memory usage compared to traditional <strong>list</strong> requests, ensuring a more efficient and stable system,
especially in clusters with a large number of objects of a given type or large average object sizes where despite paging memory consumption used to be high.</p>
<p>Building on the insight gained from the synthetic test (see the <a href="#the-synthetic-test">synthetic test</a>, we developed an automated performance test to systematically evaluate the impact of the <em>watch list</em> feature.
This test replicates the same scenario, generating a large number of Secrets with a large payload, and scaling the number of informers to simulate heavy <strong>list</strong> request patterns.
The automated test is executed periodically to monitor memory usage of the server with the feature enabled and disabled.</p>
<p>The results showed significant improvements with the <em>watch list</em> feature enabled.
With the feature turned on, the kube-apiserver’s memory consumption stabilized at approximately <strong>2 GB</strong>.
By contrast, with the feature disabled, memory usage increased to approximately <strong>20GB</strong>, a <strong>10x</strong> increase!
These results confirm the effectiveness of the new streaming API, which reduces the temporary memory footprint.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-api-streaming-for-your-component">Enabling API Streaming for your component</h2>
<p>Upgrade to Kubernetes 1.32. Make sure your cluster uses etcd in version 3.4.31+ or 3.5.13+.
Change your client software to use watch lists. If your client code is written in Golang, you'll want to enable <code>WatchListClient</code> for client-go.
For details on enabling that feature, read <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2024/08/12/feature-gates-in-client-go">Introducing Feature Gates to Client-Go: Enhancing Flexibility and Control</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>In Kubernetes 1.32, the feature is enabled in kube-controller-manager by default despite its beta state.
This will eventually be expanded to other core components like kube-scheduler or kubelet; once the feature becomes generally available, if not earlier.
Other 3rd-party components are encouraged to opt-in to the feature during the beta phase, especially when they are at risk of accessing a large number of resources or kinds with potentially large object sizes.</p>
<p>For the time being, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/">API Priority and Fairness</a> assigns a reasonable small cost to <strong>list</strong> requests.
This is necessary to allow enough parallelism for the average case where <strong>list</strong> requests are cheap enough.
But it does not match the spiky exceptional situation of many and large objects.
Once the majority of the Kubernetes ecosystem has switched to <em>watch list</em>, the <strong>list</strong> cost estimation can be changed to larger values without risking degraded performance in the average case,
and with that increasing the protection against this kind of requests that can still hit the API server in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-synthetic-test">The synthetic test</h2>
<p>In order to reproduce the issue, we conducted a manual test to understand the impact of <strong>list</strong> requests on kube-apiserver memory usage.
In the test, we created 400 Secrets, each containing 1 MB of data, and used informers to retrieve all Secrets.</p>
<p>The results were alarming, only 16 informers were needed to cause the test server to run out of memory and crash, demonstrating how quickly memory consumption can grow under such conditions.</p>

<p>In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a
<code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> option for the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/#static-policy-options">CPU Manager static policy</a>.
This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the
policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-feature">Understanding the feature</h2>
<p>The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#explicitly-reserved-cpu-list">Explicitly Reserved CPU List</a> page.</p>
<p>If you want to protect your system daemons and interrupt processing, the obvious way is to use the <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> option.</p>
<p>However, until the Kubernetes v1.32 release, this isolation was only implemented for guaranteed
pods that made requests for a whole number of CPUs. At pod admission time, the kubelet only
compares the CPU <em>requests</em> against the allocatable CPUs. In Kubernetes, limits can be higher than
the requests; the previous implementation allowed burstable and best-effort pods to use up
the capacity of <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code>, which could then starve host OS services of CPU - and we
know that people saw this in real life deployments.
The existing behavior also made benchmarking (for both infrastructure and workloads) results inaccurate.</p>
<p>When this new <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option is enabled, the CPU Manager static policy will not allow any workload to use the reserved system CPU cores.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-the-feature">Enabling the feature</h2>
<p>To enable this feature, you need to turn on both the <code>CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions</code> feature gate and the <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> policy option. And you need to remove the <code>/var/lib/kubelet/cpu_manager_state</code> file if it exists and restart kubelet.</p>
<p>With the following kubelet configuration:</p>

<p>You can monitor the feature impact by checking the following CPU Manager counters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cpu_manager_shared_pool_size_millicores</code>: report shared pool size, in millicores (e.g. 13500m)</li>
<li><code>cpu_manager_exclusive_cpu_allocation_count</code>: report exclusively allocated cores, counting full cores (e.g. 16)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your best-effort workloads may starve if the <code>cpu_manager_shared_pool_size_millicores</code> count is zero for prolonged time.</p>
<p>We believe any pod that is required for operational purpose like a log forwarder should not run as best-effort, but you can review and adjust the amount of CPU cores reserved as needed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Strict CPU reservation is critical for Telco/NFV use cases. It is also a prerequisite for enabling the all-in-one type of deployments where workloads are placed on nodes serving combined control+worker+storage roles.</p>

    <h1>Go Protobuf: The new Opaque API</h1>
      
      <p class="author">
      Michael Stapelberg<br>
      16 December 2024
      </p>
      
      <p>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)</a>
is Google&rsquo;s language-neutral data interchange format. See
<a href="https://protobuf.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">protobuf.dev</a>.]</p>
<p>Back in March 2020, we released the <code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> module, <a href="/blog/protobuf-apiv2">a
major overhaul of the Go Protobuf API</a>. This
package introduced first-class <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">support for
reflection</a>,
a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/types/dynamicpb" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>dynamicpb</code></a>
implementation and the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/testing/protocmp" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>protocmp</code></a>
package for easier testing.</p>
<p>That release introduced a new protobuf module with a new API. Today, we are
releasing an additional API for generated code, meaning the Go code in the
<code>.pb.go</code> files created by the protocol compiler (<code>protoc</code>). This blog post
explains our motivation for creating a new API and shows you how to use it in
your projects.</p>
<p>To be clear: We are not removing anything. We will continue to support the
existing API for generated code, just like we still support the older protobuf
module (by wrapping the <code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> implementation). Go is
<a href="/blog/compat">committed to backwards compatibility</a> and this
applies to Go Protobuf, too!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background: the (existing) Open Struct API</h2>
<p>We now call the existing API the Open Struct API, because generated struct types
are open to direct access. In the next section, we will see how it differs from
the new Opaque API.</p>
<p>To work with protocol buffers, you first create a <code>.proto</code> definition file like
this one:</p>
<pre><code>edition = &quot;2023&quot;;  // successor to proto2 and proto3

package log;

message LogEntry {
  string backend_server = 1;
  uint32 request_size = 2;
  string ip_address = 3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you <a href="https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/gotutorial/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">run the protocol compiler
(<code>protoc</code>)</a> to generate code
like the following (in a <code>.pb.go</code> file):</p>
<pre><code>package logpb

type LogEntry struct {
  BackendServer *string
  RequestSize   *uint32
  IPAddress     *string
  // …internal fields elided…
}

func (l *LogEntry) GetBackendServer() string { … }
func (l *LogEntry) GetRequestSize() uint32   { … }
func (l *LogEntry) GetIPAddress() string     { … }
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can import the generated <code>logpb</code> package from your Go code and call
functions like
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Marshal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.Marshal</code></a>
to encode <code>logpb.LogEntry</code> messages into protobuf wire format.</p>
<p>You can find more details in the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/go-generated/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Generated Code API
documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="presence">(Existing) Open Struct API: Field Presence</h3>
<p>An important aspect of this generated code is how <em>field presence</em> (whether a
field is set or not) is modeled. For instance, the above example models presence
using pointers, so you could set the <code>BackendServer</code> field to:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>proto.String(&quot;zrh01.prod&quot;)</code>: the field is set and contains &ldquo;zrh01.prod&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>proto.String(&quot;&quot;)</code>: the field is set (non-<code>nil</code> pointer) but contains an
empty value</li>
<li><code>nil</code> pointer: the field is not set</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are used to generated code not having pointers, you are probably using
<code>.proto</code> files that start with <code>syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;</code>. The field presence behavior
changed over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>syntax = &quot;proto2&quot;</code> uses <em>explicit presence</em> by default</li>
<li><code>syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;</code> used <em>implicit presence</em> by default (where cases 2 and 3
cannot be distinguished and are both represented by an empty string), but was
later extended to allow <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#field-labels" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">opting into explicit presence with the <code>optional</code>
keyword</a></li>
<li><code>edition = &quot;2023&quot;</code>, the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/editions/overview/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">successor to both proto2 and
proto3</a>, uses <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/field_presence/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>explicit
presence</em></a> by default</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="opaqueapi">The new Opaque API</h2>
<p>We created the new <em>Opaque API</em> to uncouple the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/go-generated/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Generated Code
API</a> from the underlying
in-memory representation. The (existing) Open Struct API has no such separation:
it allows programs direct access to the protobuf message memory. For example,
one could use the <code>flag</code> package to parse command-line flag values into protobuf
message fields:</p>
<pre><code>var req logpb.LogEntry
flag.StringVar(&amp;req.BackendServer, &quot;backend&quot;, os.Getenv(&quot;HOST&quot;), &quot;…&quot;)
flag.Parse() // fills the BackendServer field from -backend flag
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with such a tight coupling is that we can never change how we lay
out protobuf messages in memory. Lifting this restriction enables many
implementation improvements, which we&rsquo;ll see below.</p>
<p>What changes with the new Opaque API? Here is how the generated code from the
above example would change:</p>
<pre><code>package logpb

type LogEntry struct {
  xxx_hidden_BackendServer *string // no longer exported
  xxx_hidden_RequestSize   uint32  // no longer exported
  xxx_hidden_IPAddress     *string // no longer exported
  // …internal fields elided…
}

func (l *LogEntry) GetBackendServer() string { … }
func (l *LogEntry) HasBackendServer() bool   { … }
func (l *LogEntry) SetBackendServer(string)  { … }
func (l *LogEntry) ClearBackendServer()      { … }
// …
</code></pre>
<p>With the Opaque API, the struct fields are hidden and can no longer be
directly accessed. Instead, the new accessor methods allow for getting, setting,
or clearing a field.</p>
<h3 id="lessmemory">Opaque structs use less memory</h3>
<p>One change we made to the memory layout is to model field presence for
elementary fields more efficiently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The (existing) Open Struct API uses pointers, which adds a 64-bit word to the
space cost of the field.</li>
<li>The Opaque API uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">bit
fields</a>, which require one bit per
field (ignoring padding overhead).</li>
</ul>
<p>Using fewer variables and pointers also lowers load on the allocator and on the
garbage collector.</p>
<p>The performance improvement depends heavily on the shapes of your protocol
messages: The change only affects elementary fields like integers, bools, enums,
and floats, but not strings, repeated fields, or submessages (because it is
<a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/opaque-faq/#memorylayout" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">less
profitable</a>
for those types).</p>
<p>Our benchmark results show that messages with few elementary fields exhibit
performance that is as good as before, whereas messages with more elementary
fields are decoded with significantly fewer allocations:</p>
<pre><code>             │ Open Struct API │             Opaque API             │
             │    allocs/op    │  allocs/op   vs base               │
Prod#1          360.3k ± 0%       360.3k ± 0%  +0.00% (p=0.002 n=6)
Search#1       1413.7k ± 0%       762.3k ± 0%  -46.08% (p=0.002 n=6)
Search#2        314.8k ± 0%       132.4k ± 0%  -57.95% (p=0.002 n=6)
</code></pre>
<p>Reducing allocations also makes decoding protobuf messages more efficient:</p>
<pre><code>             │ Open Struct API │             Opaque API            │
             │   user-sec/op   │ user-sec/op  vs base              │
Prod#1         55.55m ± 6%        55.28m ± 4%  ~ (p=0.180 n=6)
Search#1       324.3m ± 22%       292.0m ± 6%  -9.97% (p=0.015 n=6)
Search#2       67.53m ± 10%       45.04m ± 8%  -33.29% (p=0.002 n=6)
</code></pre>
<p>(All measurements done on an AMD Castle Peak Zen 2. Results on ARM and Intel
CPUs are similar.)</p>
<p>Note: proto3 with implicit presence similarly does not use pointers, so you will
not see a performance improvement if you are coming from proto3. If you were
using implicit presence for performance reasons, forgoing the convenience of
being able to distinguish empty fields from unset ones, then the Opaque API now
makes it possible to use explicit presence without a performance penalty.</p>
<h3 id="lazydecoding">Motivation: Lazy Decoding</h3>
<p>Lazy decoding is a performance optimization where the contents of a submessage
are decoded when first accessed instead of during
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Unmarshal" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>proto.Unmarshal</code></a>. Lazy
decoding can improve performance by avoiding unnecessarily decoding fields which
are never accessed.</p>
<p>Lazy decoding can&rsquo;t be supported safely by the (existing) Open Struct API. While
the Open Struct API provides getters, leaving the (un-decoded) struct fields
exposed would be extremely error-prone. To ensure that the decoding logic runs
immediately before the field is first accessed, we must make the field private
and mediate all accesses to it through getter and setter functions.</p>
<p>This approach made it possible to implement lazy decoding with the Opaque
API. Of course, not every workload will benefit from this optimization, but for
those that do benefit, the results can be spectacular: We have seen logs
analysis pipelines that discard messages based on a top-level message condition
(e.g. whether <code>backend_server</code> is one of the machines running a new Linux kernel
version) and can skip decoding deeply nested subtrees of messages.</p>
<p>As an example, here are the results of the micro-benchmark we included,
demonstrating how lazy decoding saves over 50% of the work and over 87% of
allocations!</p>
<pre><code>                  │   nolazy    │                lazy                │
                  │   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base               │
Unmarshal/lazy-24   6.742µ ± 0%   2.816µ ± 0%  -58.23% (p=0.002 n=6)

                  │    nolazy    │                lazy                 │
                  │     B/op     │     B/op      vs base               │
Unmarshal/lazy-24   3.666Ki ± 0%   1.814Ki ± 0%  -50.51% (p=0.002 n=6)

                  │   nolazy    │               lazy                │
                  │  allocs/op  │ allocs/op   vs base               │
Unmarshal/lazy-24   64.000 ± 0%   8.000 ± 0%  -87.50% (p=0.002 n=6)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="pointercomparison">Motivation: reduce pointer comparison mistakes</h3>
<p>Modeling field presence with pointers invites pointer-related bugs.</p>
<p>Consider an enum, declared within the <code>LogEntry</code> message:</p>
<pre><code>message LogEntry {
  enum DeviceType {
    DESKTOP = 0;
    MOBILE = 1;
    VR = 2;
  };
  DeviceType device_type = 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A simple mistake is to compare the <code>device_type</code> enum field like so:</p>
<pre><code>if cv.DeviceType == logpb.LogEntry_DESKTOP.Enum() { // incorrect!
</code></pre>
<p>Did you spot the bug? The condition compares the memory address instead of the
value. Because the <code>Enum()</code> accessor allocates a new variable on each call, the
condition can never be true. The check should have read:</p>
<pre><code>if cv.GetDeviceType() == logpb.LogEntry_DESKTOP {
</code></pre>
<p>The new Opaque API prevents this mistake: Because fields are hidden, all access
must go through the getter.</p>
<h3 id="accidentalsharing">Motivation: reduce accidental sharing mistakes</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a slightly more involved pointer-related bug. Assume you are
trying to stabilize an RPC service that fails under high load. The following
part of the request middleware looks correct, but still the entire service goes
down whenever just one customer sends a high volume of requests:</p>
<pre><code>logEntry.IPAddress = req.IPAddress
logEntry.BackendServer = proto.String(hostname)
// The redactIP() function redacts IPAddress to 127.0.0.1,
// unexpectedly not just in logEntry *but also* in req!
go auditlog(redactIP(logEntry))
if quotaExceeded(req) {
    // BUG: All requests end up here, regardless of their source.
    return fmt.Errorf(&quot;server overloaded&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Did you spot the bug? The first line accidentally copied the pointer (thereby
sharing the pointed-to variable between the <code>logEntry</code> and <code>req</code> messages)
instead of its value. It should have read:</p>
<pre><code>logEntry.IPAddress = proto.String(req.GetIPAddress())
</code></pre>
<p>The new Opaque API prevents this problem as the setter takes a value
(<code>string</code>) instead of a pointer:</p>
<pre><code>logEntry.SetIPAddress(req.GetIPAddress())
</code></pre>
<h3 id="reflection">Motivation: Fix Sharp Edges: reflection</h3>
<p>To write code that works not only with a specific message type
(e.g. <code>logpb.LogEntry</code>), but with any message type, one needs some kind of
reflection. The previous example used a function to redact IP addresses. To work
with any type of message, it could have been defined as <code>func redactIP(proto.Message) proto.Message { … }</code>.</p>
<p>Many years ago, your only option to implement a function like <code>redactIP</code> was to
reach for <a href="/blog/laws-of-reflection">Go&rsquo;s <code>reflect</code> package</a>,
which resulted in very tight coupling: you had only the generator output and had
to reverse-engineer what the input protobuf message definition might have looked
like. The <a href="/blog/protobuf-apiv2"><code>google.golang.org/protobuf</code> module
release</a> (from March 2020) introduced
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/reflect/protoreflect" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Protobuf
reflection</a>,
which should always be preferred: Go&rsquo;s <code>reflect</code> package traverses the data
structure&rsquo;s representation, which should be an implementation detail. Protobuf
reflection traverses the logical tree of protocol messages without regard to its
representation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, merely <em>providing</em> protobuf reflection is not sufficient and
still leaves some sharp edges exposed: In some cases, users might accidentally
use Go reflection instead of protobuf reflection.</p>
<p>For example, encoding a protobuf message with the <code>encoding/json</code> package (which
uses Go reflection) was technically possible, but the result is not <a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/#json" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">canonical
Protobuf JSON
encoding</a>. Use the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>protojson</code></a>
package instead.</p>
<p>The new Opaque API prevents this problem because the message struct fields are
hidden: accidental usage of Go reflection will see an empty message. This is
clear enough to steer developers towards protobuf reflection.</p>
<h3 id="idealmemory">Motivation: Making the ideal memory layout possible</h3>
<p>The benchmark results from the <a href="#lessmemory">More Efficient Memory
Representation</a> section have already shown that protobuf
performance heavily depends on the specific usage: How are the messages defined?
Which fields are set?</p>
<p>To keep Go Protobuf as fast as possible for <em>everyone</em>, we cannot implement
optimizations that help only one program, but hurt the performance of other
programs.</p>
<p>The Go compiler used to be in a similar situation, up until <a href="/blog/go1.20">Go 1.20 introduced
Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)</a>. By recording the
production behavior (through <a href="/blog/pprof">profiling</a>) and feeding
that profile back to the compiler, we allow the compiler to make better
trade-offs <em>for a specific program or workload</em>.</p>
<p>We think using profiles to optimize for specific workloads is a promising
approach for further Go Protobuf optimizations. The Opaque API makes those
possible: Program code uses accessors and does not need to be updated when the
memory representation changes, so we could, for example, move rarely set fields
into an overflow struct.</p>
<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>
<p>You can migrate on your own schedule, or even not at all—the (existing) Open
Struct API will not be removed. But, if you’re not on the new Opaque API, you
won’t benefit from its improved performance, or future optimizations that target
it.</p>
<p>We recommend you select the Opaque API for new development. Protobuf Edition
2024 (see <a href="https://protobuf.dev/editions/overview/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Protobuf Editions Overview</a>
if you are not yet familiar) will make the Opaque API the default.</p>
<h3 id="hybridapi">The Hybrid API</h3>
<p>Aside from the Open Struct API and Opaque API, there is also the Hybrid API,
which keeps existing code working by keeping struct fields exported, but also
enabling migration to the Opaque API by adding the new accessor methods.</p>
<p>With the Hybrid API, the protobuf compiler will generate code on two API levels:
the <code>.pb.go</code> is on the Hybrid API, whereas the <code>_protoopaque.pb.go</code> version is
on the Opaque API and can be selected by building with the <code>protoopaque</code> build
tag.</p>
<h3 id="rewriting">Rewriting Code to the Opaque API</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/opaque-migration/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">migration
guide</a>
for detailed instructions. The high-level steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable the Hybrid API.</li>
<li>Update existing code using the <code>open2opaque</code> migration tool.</li>
<li>Switch to the Opaque API.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="publishing">Advice for published generated code: Use Hybrid API</h3>
<p>Small usages of protobuf can live entirely within the same repository, but
usually, <code>.proto</code> files are shared between different projects that are owned by
different teams. An obvious example is when different companies are involved: To
call Google APIs (with protobuf), use the <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Cloud Client Libraries for
Go</a> from your project. Switching
the Cloud Client Libraries to the Opaque API is not an option, as that would be
a breaking API change, but switching to the Hybrid API is safe.</p>
<p>Our advice for such packages that publish generated code (<code>.pb.go</code> files) is to
switch to the Hybrid API please! Publish both the <code>.pb.go</code> and the
<code>_protoopaque.pb.go</code> files, please. The <code>protoopaque</code> version allows your
consumers to migrate on their own schedule.</p>
<h3 id="enablelazy">Enabling Lazy Decoding</h3>
<p>Lazy decoding is available (but not enabled) once you migrate to the Opaque API!
🎉</p>
<p>To enable: in your <code>.proto</code> file, annotate your message-typed fields with the
<code>[lazy = true]</code> annotation.</p>
<p>To opt out of lazy decoding (despite <code>.proto</code> annotations), the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/protobuf/runtime/protolazy" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>protolazy</code>
package
documentation</a>
describes the available opt-outs, which affect either an individual Unmarshal
operation or the entire program.</p>
<h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>By using the open2opaque tool in an automated fashion over the last few years,
we have converted the vast majority of Google’s <code>.proto</code> files and Go code to
the Opaque API. We continuously improved the Opaque API implementation as we
moved more and more production workloads to it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we expect you should not encounter problems when trying the Opaque
API. In case you do encounter any issues after all, please <a href="https://github.com/golang/protobuf/issues/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">let us know on the
Go Protobuf issue tracker</a>.</p>

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. 

But our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house.

Completing these tasks gives you an instant dopamine hit &#8212; a little celebration in your brain.</p><p>If you&#8217;re on LeetCode, start with easy problems. Every solved problem is like a small win that releases dopamine and keeps you coming back.</p><p>This positive feedback loop helps you form a habit of coding everyday.</p><p>As you get comfortable with the easy stuff, start leveling up.</p><p>Just like in a game, you&#8217;re now ready for the next challenge.</p><p>This way, you&#8217;re challenging yourself just enough to improve without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>It tricks your brain into thinking coding isn&#8217;t so hard and it&#8217;s something you want to keep doing.</p><h1><strong>3. Make it Fun</strong></h1><p>Next, <strong>make coding fun</strong>.</p><p>Most of us start learning to code to land that dream job or ace an interview.</p><p>But what if, just for a moment, you coded without worrying about the end result?</p><p>Think about when you play video games &#8212; you play because it&#8217;s fun, challenging, and maybe a bit competitive.</p><p>Coding can be the same way.</p><p>In the beginning, <strong>code without any pressure or expectation.</strong></p><p>When I first started learning to code, it was with C language, and honestly, I found it dull and boring.</p><p>It felt like something I had to learn to get a good grade, not something I was excited to dive into.</p><p>But things changed when I picked up Python during my summer break. For the first time, I felt like I could actually <em>create</em> something.</p><p>After learning the basics, I started building little things &#8212; first a simple calculator app, then games like Pong and Tetris, and then full-stack applications.</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t thinking about grades, interviews, or jobs &#8212; just the excitement of creating something from scratch.</p><p>Over time, I realized that when I genuinely enjoyed what I was creating, I&#8217;d lose track of time and that&#8217;s when coding started to become more than just a skill. It became a passion.</p><p>So, how can you make coding enjoyable for yourself?</p><p><strong>Start by picking projects that genuinely excite you.</strong></p><p>These projects are easy enough to finish in a short time but engaging enough to keep you interested.</p><p>They&#8217;re just for fun, a chance to experiment and make mistakes without pressure.</p><blockquote><p><em>When coding becomes fun, it shifts from something you have to do to something you want to do.</em></p></blockquote><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe to receive new articles every week.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><h1><strong>4. Checklist</strong></h1><p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about how you can gamify coding to reward yourself everyday.</p><p>The answer is to have a <strong>checklist of tasks</strong> and tick them off as you complete them.</p><p>In video games: each mission or level you complete gives you points, new abilities, or just the thrill of winning.</p><p>This reward triggers a dopamine release that keeps you playing.</p><p>Similarly, think of a checklist as a series of <strong>mini-missions</strong>.</p><p>Every time you cross an item off a checklist, it gives you a dopamine hit that helps you stay motivated motivated and keeps you coming back for more.</p><p><em>Now, creating a checklist for coding isn&#8217;t just about listing random tasks.</em></p><p>It&#8217;s about breaking down your big goals into byte sized tasks.</p><p><strong>Decide what tasks are crucial</strong> to get started and prioritize them.</p><p>Identify <strong>1&#8211;3 tasks</strong> to accomplish each day.</p><p>When learning something new, create a checklist of topics to cover. Go as granular as possible and add sub-topics as part of your checklist.</p><p>Lets say your big goal is to &#8216;Become a full-stack developer.&#8217;</p><p>That&#8217;s exciting, but it&#8217;s also overwhelming.</p><p>Instead, break it down into smaller steps like:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

tools like ChatGPT to generate these checklists with any level of granularity you need.</strong></p><p>When you have a checklist in place, every day feels like a small victory.</p><p>Even if you don&#8217;t finish everything, you have a clear view of your achievements and what&#8217;s left.</p><p>Coding becomes something you want to come back to, just to see that checklist getting

Novelty</strong></h1><p>Alright, let&#8217;s talk about one of the most powerful, yet underrated, aspects of learning: <strong>novelty</strong>.</p><p>Our brains are wired to seek out new experiences.</p><p>Without variety, coding can start to feel repetitive, even boring.</p><p>I remember the first time I switched from Python to learning Java &#8212; it was like learning to ride a bike all over again.</p><p>Everything felt different, from the syntax to the approach to solving problems.</p><p>But that challenge was also what made it exciting.</p><p>One way to keep things interesting is by exploring different types of projects and technologies.</p><p>If you&#8217;ve been working on web development for a while, try something different &#8212;

CPUs execute billions of instructions per second, yet moving data — whether between memory levels or across subsystems — remains orders of magnitude slower. This discrepancy is rooted in physical constraints, such as the speed of light and the time required for electrons to traverse memory buses. Memory bandwidth, latency, and caching hierarchy (L1, L2, L3 caches) are foundational in determining system performance. Understanding and optimizing these factors is central to streamlining data flow and minimizing data motion. The challenge becomes even more significant when working in managed languages like Go, where garbage collection and memory abstraction add further complexity.</p><h3>The Cost of Data Motion vs. Compute</h3><p>The principle that “compute is cheaper than data motion” arises because modern processors are highly optimized for localized operations on data already present in caches. Moving data between caches, main memory, or across interconnects introduces latency that dwarfs computation times. For example, accessing L1 cache can take as little as 1–3 CPU cycles, while accessing main memory may take 100+ cycles. These latencies magnify when data transfers traverse NUMA nodes or I/O subsystems.</p><h4>Memory Bandwidth and Caching</h4><p>Memory bandwidth refers to the rate at which data can be read from or written to memory. It becomes a bottleneck when a program’s working set exceeds the capacity of higher-level caches. Memory-aware optimizations aim to bridge this gap by focusing on how data is accessed and structured.</p><ul><li><strong>Exploiting Cache Hierarchies:</strong> Structure data to maximize temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to reusing the same data frequently, while spatial locality involves accessing contiguous memory regions. For instance, iterating over a matrix row-wise rather than column-wise takes advantage of how modern CPUs prefetch adjacent memory blocks, drastically reducing cache misses.</li><li><strong>Avoiding Cache Pollution:</strong> Access only the data required for computation, reducing unnecessary evictions of useful cache lines. Polluting the cache with extraneous data results in thrashing, where useful data is repeatedly evicted and reloaded. In Go, this might involve careful iteration patterns for slices and maps to ensure efficient cache usage.</li><li><strong>Leverage Blocking Techniques:</strong> Divide computations into chunks that fit within the L1 or L2 cache size, minimizing the need for repeated memory accesses. For example, matrix multiplication algorithms can be restructured to process submatrices that fit entirely into cache.</li><li><strong>Profile and Optimize Memory Behavior:</strong> Tools such as perf, pprof, and cache simulators can identify bandwidth bottlenecks and optimize data placement. Profiling also reveals whether TLB misses—caused by frequent page table lookups—are affecting performance. This insight is vital when processing large datasets in Go, where heap allocations may exacerbate memory fragmentation.</li></ul><h4>Speed-of-Light Constraints</h4><p>Data motion is constrained by physical distances within the hardware. For example, even within a single CPU, moving data between registers, caches, and RAM involves electrical signal propagation limited by the speed of light. At large scales, such as distributed systems or memory-bound HPC tasks, these propagation delays dominate execution times. Optimizing local data usage minimizes these delays and improves system efficiency.</p><h3>Streamlining Data Flow</h3><p>Streamlining data flow requires designing systems to process data efficiently within the constraints of hardware and software. In Go, the choice of data structures, serialization formats, and concurrency primitives directly impacts data flow and execution efficiency.</p><h4>Serialization: JSON vs. Protobuf vs. FlatBuffers</h4><p>Serialization formats are a key consideration in data-intensive applications. JSON is widely used but inefficient due to its verbose structure and reliance on runtime parsing. Protobuf, in contrast, is compact and well-suited for binary serialization but involves additional memory copies during encoding and decoding. FlatBuffers take this further by enabling zero-copy deserialization, which avoids unnecessary data duplication entirely.</p><ul><li><strong>JSON:</strong> Best for human-readable data exchange but expensive in terms of data motion and parsing. Large JSON payloads frequently trigger multiple allocations during deserialization in Go.</li><li><strong>Protobuf:</strong> Compact and fast, with schema enforcement. However, Protobuf involves intermediate memory allocations due to the need for temporary message structures during decoding.</li><li><strong>FlatBuffers:</strong> Ideal for HPC workloads where zero-copy deserialization reduces data motion and garbage collection pressure. FlatBuffers store serialized data in a manner that allows direct access without parsing.</li></ul><p>For systems requiring high throughput, FlatBuffers often outperform Protobuf by avoiding redundant memory copies, especially for large datasets. However, JSON remains useful for debugging and configuration due to its human-readable format.</p><p>Another <strong>pattern to Avoid</strong> is using JSON for serialization in high-throughput systems.</p><pre>jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(data)<br>json.Unmarshal(jsonData, &amp;parsedData)</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> is using FlatBuffers for zero-copy deserialization.</p><pre>// Serialize using FlatBuffers<br>builder := flatbuffers.NewBuilder(1024)<br>... // FlatBuffers schema-based data setup<br>buf := builder.FinishedBytes()<br><br>// Access serialized data without copying<br>flatData := GetRootAsFlatData(buf, 0)<br>value := flatData.SomeField()</pre><p>This eliminates the overhead of intermediate allocations and redundant parsing.</p><h4>In-Place Data Transformations</h4><p>Modifying data in place rather than creating copies avoids unnecessary memory allocations and reduces data motion. In Go, this practice is particularly important because it minimizes interactions with the garbage collector. For instance:</p><p>A common <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> is duplicating data during transformations.</p><pre>func doubleSlice(data []int) []int {<br>    result := make([]int, len(data))<br>    for i := range data {<br>        result[i] = data[i] * 2<br>    }<br>    return result<br>}</pre><p>The <strong>better alternative</strong> modifies the data in place.</p><pre>func doubleSlice(data []int) {<br>    for i := range data {<br>        data[i] *= 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>This approach eliminates redundant allocations and keeps the data within the cache hierarchy, significantly improving performance in iterative computations. Combining this technique with batched operations ensures that data remains cache-resident during intensive computations.</p><h4>Favor Asynchronous Communication</h4><p>Asynchronous communication can eliminate unnecessary blocking and improve throughput in applications where tasks can progress independently. In Go, channels are the primary mechanism for implementing asynchronous workflows. They decouple sender and receiver goroutines, allowing the system to process data in a pipeline or fan-out/fan-in pattern. However, note that managing concurrency well is equally important, poorly implemented, it can amplify contention.</p><p>Note a <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> with channels is coupling goroutines with frequent intercommunication via channels.</p><pre>func worker(input &lt;-chan int, output chan&lt;- int) {<br>    for num := range input {<br>        output &lt;- num * 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>The <strong>better alternative</strong> uses partitioned data processing with independent goroutines.</p><pre>func worker(data []int) {<br>    for i := range data {<br>        data[i] *= 2<br>    }<br>}<br><br>func main() {<br>    data := make([]int, 1000)<br>    chunkSize := 100<br><br>    var wg sync.WaitGroup<br>    for i := 0; i &lt; len(data); i += chunkSize {<br>        wg.Add(1)<br>        go func(slice []int) {<br>            defer wg.Done()<br>            worker(slice)<br>        }(data[i:min(i+chunkSize, len(data))])<br>    }<br>    wg.Wait()<br>}</pre><p>This minimizes synchronization overhead while maintaining concurrency. Asynchronous patterns like this reduce contention and improve scalability by allowing different stages of computation to progress concurrently.</p><h4>Minimize Inter-Goroutine Communication</h4><p>While Go’s lightweight goroutines make concurrency easy, excessive communication between goroutines can lead to bottlenecks. Minimize inter-goroutine communication by designing systems where each goroutine operates independently on localized data.</p><h4>Avoid Locks and Mutexes</h4><p>Locks and mutexes serialize access to shared resources, removing concurrency benefits and increasing contention. Instead, use channels for synchronization or atomic operations for simple counters. When data sharing is unavoidable, minimize critical sections to reduce contention.</p><h3>Scalability as an Architecture Choice</h3><p>Designing for scalability begins at the architectural level. For single-application designs, consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Stateless Services:</strong> Avoid coupling application state to individual processes. Use external stores for state management, enabling horizontal scaling.</li><li><strong>Partitioning Workloads:</strong> Divide tasks into smaller, independent units that can be distributed across multiple worker processes or threads.</li><li><strong>Backpressure Management:</strong> Use bounded channels or rate-limiting techniques to ensure that the system can handle varying workloads without becoming overwhelmed.</li></ul><h3>Memory Allocation and Garbage Collection in Go</h3><p>Go’s garbage collector (GC) is optimized for low-latency applications, but HPC workloads often require precise control over memory to minimize GC interruptions.</p><h4>Escape Analysis</h4><p>Escape analysis determines whether a variable can be allocated on the stack instead of the heap. Stack allocations are much cheaper as they avoid GC involvement. Writing functions that limit pointer escapes helps reduce GC overhead:</p><pre>func createBuffer(size int) []byte {<br>    buf := make([]byte, size)<br>    return buf // Avoid returning a pointer to escape heap allocation<br>}</pre><p>Profiling escape analysis in Go with go build -gcflags=&quot;-m&quot; identifies opportunities for stack allocation. Avoiding heap allocations in performance-critical code paths ensures consistent, low-latency execution.</p><h4>Object Pooling</h4><p>Using sync.Pool for object pooling reduces heap allocations by recycling objects. This approach is particularly effective for short-lived objects like buffers or temporary data structures.</p><p>The <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> is frequent heap allocations leading to GC overhead.</p><pre>func createBuffers(count int, size int) [][]byte {<br>    buffers := make([][]byte, count)<br>    for i := range buffers {<br>        buffers[i] = make([]byte, size)<br>    }<br>    return buffers<br>}</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> preallocates memory and recycle buffers using sync.Pool.</p><pre>var bufferPool = sync.Pool{<br>    New: func() interface{} {<br>        return make([]byte, 1024)<br>    },<br>}<br><br>func process() {<br>    buf := bufferPool.Get().([]byte)<br>    defer bufferPool.Put(buf)<br>    // Process data with buf<br>}</pre><p>Pooling reduces heap pressure and improves memory reuse, i.e. reduces memory fragmentation and ensures that buffers are allocated contiguously, maximizing cache performance. Over-pooling, however, may retain unused objects, inflating memory usage and requiring careful monitoring.</p><h4>Managing Allocation Patterns</h4><ul><li><strong>Batch Allocation:</strong> Allocate slices and objects in large batches to amortize allocation overhead. Batch allocation improves cache performance by reducing scattered allocations.</li><li><strong>Avoid Fragmentation:</strong> Use contiguous slices rather than fragmented structures to maintain cache-friendly layouts. Fragmentation leads to increased TLB misses and degraded memory access times.</li><li><strong>Minimize Pointer Chaining:</strong> Excessive pointers degrade cache performance due to scattered memory accesses. Flattening data structures minimizes this overhead.</li></ul><p>An exmaple <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> that is not immediately obvious: Iterating over a 2D slice inefficiently by accessing columns (which leads to non-contiguous memory access).</p><pre>for j := 0; j &lt; len(matrix[0]); j++ {<br>    for i := 0; i &lt; len(matrix); i++ {<br>        matrix[i][j] *= 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> iterates row-by-row to leverage spatial locality.</p><pre>for i := 0; i &lt; len(matrix); i++ {<br>    for j := 0; j &lt; len(matrix[0]); j++ {<br>        matrix[i][j] *= 2<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>Adjacent elements in memory are accessed sequentially, reducing cache misses.</p><h4>Memory Alignment</h4><p>Memory alignment ensures that data structures are positioned at memory addresses that are multiples of their size. Misaligned data can lead to performance penalties on some architectures. Go’s memory allocator aligns objects to their size by default, but manual alignment may be necessary for specific use cases, such as SIMD operations.</p><p>To aid memory alignment, <strong>pattern to avoid</strong> is using pointer-heavy or fragmented data structures, leading to scattered memory access.</p><pre>type Node struct {<br>    Value int<br>    Next  *Node<br>}</pre><p>A <strong>better alternative</strong> is to use contiguous slices for data storage where possible.</p><pre>type Node struct {<br>    Values []int<br>}</pre><p>Flattening structures improves cache performance and minimizes pointer dereferencing.</p><h4>GC Tuning in HPC</h4><p>Garbage collection in Go introduces predictable but non-negligible latency. Tuning GC behavior for HPC workloads involves:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce Allocation Frequency:</strong> Preallocate memory and reuse objects to reduce pressure on the GC.</li><li><strong>Profile GC Activity:</strong> Use pprof to identify regions with high allocation rates and optimize them to minimize GC overhead.</li><li><strong>Adjust GOGC:</strong> The GOGC environment variable controls GC aggressiveness. Lowering it reduces memory usage but increases GC frequency.</li></ul><h3>Managing Performance Counters and Logging</h3><p>Performance counters and logging are essential for understanding application behavior. However, excessive instrumentation can degrade performance, especially in HPC environments.</p><h4>Lock-Free Metrics Collection</h4><p>Using atomic operations for counters ensures thread-safe, low-latency updates without locks:</p><pre>var requestCount uint64<br><br>func incrementRequestCount() {<br>    atomic.AddUint64(&amp;requestCount, 1)<br>}</pre><p>Atomic Compare-and-Swap (CAS) operations can also be used for complex metrics updates, maintaining high performance even under heavy contention.</p><h4>Efficient Logging</h4><p>Logging should balance granularity and overhead. Techniques include:</p><ul><li><strong>Structured Logging:</strong> Use lightweight formats like JSON for logs, ensuring they can be parsed efficiently.</li><li><strong>Batch Logging:</strong> Aggregate log entries in memory and write them in batches to reduce I/O overhead.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Logging:</strong> Offload log writing to separate goroutines to minimize impact on application performance.</li></ul><h4>Push-Based Metrics Collection</h4><p>Aggregating and occasionally pushing metrics balances real-time monitoring with low overhead. For example:</p><pre>func reportMetrics() {<br>    total := atomic.LoadUint64(&amp;requestCount)<br>    fmt.Printf(&quot;Total Requests: %d\n&quot;, total)<br>}</pre><p>Batching metrics ensures that reporting does not interfere with computation, aligning with lock-free principles for minimal contention.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Optimizing data flow and minimizing data motion requires understanding hardware limitations, such as memory bandwidth and cache hierarchies. Go, while a garbage-collected language, is well-suited for HPC when its memory management features are leveraged effectively. Techniques like serialization optimization, object pooling, in-place transformations, asynchronous communication, and lock-free metrics collection help Go applications achieve high throughput and low latency. When paired with careful profiling and tuning, these strategies elevate Go as a practical choice for HPC, balancing developer productivity with computational efficiency.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6ec8340c38e9" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin was in a constant state of improvisation (ft.

Javier Milei has been in office for one year having taken over an economy on the brink of collapse. Milei managed to cut the monthly inflation rate from 26 per cent before he took office to 2.7 per cent in October. The Argentine peso has strengthened significantly against the black-market dollar over the past six months and Argentina’s sovereign bond prices have roughly tripled.

              <p>A sophisticated and ongoing supply-chain attack operating for the past year has been stealing sensitive login credentials from both malicious and benevolent security personnel by infecting them with Trojanized versions of open source software from GitHub and NPM, researchers said.</p>
<p>The campaign, first reported three weeks ago by security firm <a href="https://checkmarx.com/blog/dozens-of-machines-infected-year-long-npm-supply-chain-attack-combines-crypto-mining-and-data-theft/">Checkmarx</a> and again on Friday by <a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/mut-1244-targeting-offensive-actors/">Datadog Security Labs</a>, uses multiple avenues to infect the devices of researchers in security and other technical fields. One is through packages that have been available on open source repositories for over a year. They install a professionally developed backdoor that takes pains to conceal its presence. The unknown threat actors behind the campaign have also employed spear phishing that targets thousands of researchers who publish papers on the arXiv platform.</p>
<h2>Unusual longevity</h2>
<p>The objectives of the threat actors are also multifaceted. One is the collection of SSH private keys, Amazon Web Services access keys, command histories, and other sensitive information from infected devices every 12 hours. When this post went live, dozens of machines remained infected, and an online account on Dropbox contained some 390,000 credentials for WordPress websites taken by the attackers, most likely by stealing them from fellow malicious threat actors. The malware used in the campaign also installs cryptomining software that was present on at least 68 machines as of last month.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/yearlong-supply-chain-attack-targeting-security-pros-steals-390k-credentials/">Read full article</a></p>

But the endeavours of Alan Turing, Dilly Knox and their colleagues were so top secret that we are only now beginning to learn how they really lived day-to-day in this magnificent house, where – behind closed doors, under the cover of darkness, and against the clock - they determined the course of our wartime history. 

The house is also fascinating for what it tells us about how the 10,000 men and women working there would live on a daily basis. Artefacts from a Recreation Club – offering activities such as fencing, debating societies and amateur dramatics, amongst others – and film showings suggest an atmosphere not dissimilar to an Oxbridge college, and show a more human side to the story of how they developed the Enigma Machine. In this World War Two Season Special, join Dan Snow on an exclusive tour of the house and grounds, as well as the little known but all-important cottages that surround them. Learn about the men and women whose skill and ingenuity saved millions of lives, and about the machine they developed to help them do it.

Decades of low productivity, reliance on traditional industry and a failure to invest have lost it trillions of euros in growth, leading to this moment of reckoning. With France facing political upheaval and Germany’s economy in a downturn, the continent is at risk of losing its seat at the table, and maybe its ability to protect itself in a world where security is no longer guaranteed.

Scambaiters like Kitboga, who started by wasting scammers’ time and humiliating them, are now creating tools to protect potential victims and collaborating with law enforcement to dismantle major operations.

In this episode of Bloomberg Investigates, we witness how Jim Browning exposes a significant crypto scam in Dubai, facilitated by an insider, a private investigator, and a victim.

<p>With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA),
marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications.
Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/">CPU Manager</a>.</p>
<p>As part of kubelet's workload admission process,
the memory manager provides topology hints
to optimize memory allocation and alignment.
This enables users to allocate exclusive
memory for Pods in the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#guaranteed">Guaranteed</a> QoS class.
More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/11/kubernetes-1-22-feature-memory-manager-moves-to-beta/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the changes introduced since the Beta are bug fixes, internal refactoring and
observability improvements, such as metrics and better logging.</p>
<h2 id="observability-improvements">Observability improvements</h2>
<p>As part of the effort
to increase the observability of memory manager, new metrics have been added
to provide some statistics on memory allocation patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>memory_manager_pinning_requests_total</strong> -
tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager to pin memory pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>memory_manager_pinning_errors_total</strong> -
tracks the number of times the pod spec required the memory manager
to pin memory pages, but the allocation failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improving-memory-manager-reliability-and-consistency">Improving memory manager reliability and consistency</h2>
<p>The kubelet does not guarantee pod ordering
when admitting pods after a restart or reboot.</p>
<p>In certain edge cases, this behavior could cause
the memory manager to reject some pods,
and in more extreme cases, it may cause kubelet to fail upon restart.</p>
<p>Previously, the beta implementation lacked certain checks and logic to prevent
these issues.</p>
<p>To stabilize the memory manager for general availability (GA) readiness,
small but critical refinements have been
made to the algorithm, improving its robustness and handling of edge cases.</p>
<h2 id="future-development">Future development</h2>
<p>There is more to come for the future of Topology Manager in general,
and memory manager in particular.
Notably, ongoing efforts are underway
to extend <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/128560">memory manager support to Windows</a>,
enabling CPU and memory affinity on a Windows operating system.</p>
<h2 id="getting-involved">Getting involved</h2>
<p>This feature is driven by the <a href="https://github.com/Kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-node/README.md">SIG Node</a> community.
Please join us to connect with the community
and share your ideas and feedback around the above feature and
beyond.
We look forward to hearing from you!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Jewish Man Who Helped The Nazis And Other WW2 Collaborators</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5Uu65MyeAM</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 22:00:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World War 2 created many impossible decisions for the people who fell victim to this all-consuming war.

              <p>Thousands of sites running WordPress remain unpatched against a critical security flaw in a widely used plugin that was being actively exploited in attacks that allow for unauthenticated execution of malicious code, security researchers said.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-11972">CVE-2024-11972</a>, is found in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hunk-companion/#description">Hunk Companion</a>, a plugin that runs on 10,000 sites that use the WordPress content management system. The vulnerability, which carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of a possible 10, was patched earlier this week. At the time this post went live on Ars, figures provided on the Hunk Companion page indicated that less than 12 percent of users had installed the patch, meaning nearly 9,000 sites could be next to be targeted.</p>
<h2>Significant, multifaceted threat</h2>
<p>“This vulnerability represents a significant and multifaceted threat, targeting sites that use both a ThemeHunk theme and the Hunk Companion plugin,” Daniel Rodriguez, a researcher with WordPress security firm WP Scan, <a href="https://wpscan.com/blog/unauthorized-plugin-installation-activation-in-hunk-companion/">wrote</a>. “With over 10,000 active installations, this exposed thousands of websites to anonymous, unauthenticated attacks capable of severely compromising their integrity.”</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/thousands-of-sites-remain-unpatched-against-actively-exploited-wordpress-plugin-bug/">Read full article</a></p>

              <p>On Thursday, OpenAI announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/when-counting-quickly-openais-new-voice-mode-stops-to-catch-its-breath/">ChatGPT</a> users can now talk to a simulated version of Santa Claus through the app's voice mode, using AI to bring a North Pole connection to mobile devices, desktop apps, and web browsers during the holiday season.</p>
<p>The company added Santa's voice and personality as a preset option in ChatGPT's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/talking-to-chatgpt-for-the-first-time-is-a-surreal-experience/">Advanced Voice Mode</a>. Users can access Santa by tapping a snowflake icon next to the prompt bar or through voice settings. The feature works on iOS and Android mobile apps, chatgpt.com, and OpenAI's Windows and MacOS applications. The Santa voice option will remain available to users worldwide until early January.</p>
<p>The conversations with Santa exist as temporary chats that won't save to chat history or affect the model's memory. OpenAI designed this limitation specifically for the holiday feature. Keep that in mind, because if you let your kids talk to Santa, the AI simulation won't remember what kids have told it during previous conversations.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-introduces-santa-mode-to-chatgpt-for-ho-ho-ho-voice-chats/">Read full article</a></p>

--

Long ago, an emperor decided to build a great wall to protect his new empire and ensure his power. He ordered men across China to leave their homes and submit to the grueling labor required for its construction. As years passed and the wall grew, few returned home. But one worker’s death spelled trouble for the wall. Juwen Zhang shares the myth of the heartbroken Lady Meng Jiang and her sabotage.

Lesson by Juwen Zhang, directed by Raghav Arumugam, Jagriti Khirwar.

is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>&rsquo;s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (&ldquo;whatever program you happen to be running&rdquo;) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here&rsquo;s a quick table of contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</a></li>
<li><a href="#these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</a></li>

<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave &ndash; the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn&rsquo;t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there&rsquo;s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I&rsquo;m using. Instead of &ldquo;uh, programs could do literally
anything&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m just writing down what I&rsquo;ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it&rsquo;s not always obvious which &ldquo;rules&rdquo; are the program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program&rsquo;s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print &ldquo;regular&rdquo; output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I&rsquo;m going to focus on things that it&rsquo;s not 100% obvious are
the program&rsquo;s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a &ldquo;law of nature&rdquo;
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it &ndash; even though <code>cat</code> doesn&rsquo;t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in &ldquo;rule 3&rdquo; below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program&rsquo;s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs&rsquo; implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don&rsquo;t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a &ldquo;you should act like the default&rdquo; rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn&rsquo;t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is
that by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very
recently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash
with some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default
ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme
will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux&rsquo;s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a
program is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage. The only reason I&rsquo;ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/">scheduler</a> is the core
component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes
these new Pods <strong>one by one</strong>. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important
the throughput of the scheduler becomes.</p>
<p>Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput
of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the
scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/#extension-points">scheduling context element</a>
named <em>QueueingHint</em>. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how
QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling-queue">Scheduling queue</h2>
<p>The scheduler stores all unscheduled Pods in an internal component called the <em>scheduling queue</em>.</p>
<p>The scheduling queue consists of the following data structures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ActiveQ</strong>: holds newly created Pods or Pods that are ready to be retried for scheduling.</li>
<li><strong>BackoffQ</strong>: holds Pods that are ready to be retried but are waiting for a backoff period to end. The
backoff period depends on the number of unsuccessful scheduling attempts performed by the scheduler on that Pod.</li>
<li><strong>Unschedulable Pod Pool</strong>: holds Pods that the scheduler won't attempt to schedule for one of the
following reasons:
<ul>
<li>The scheduler previously attempted and was unable to schedule the Pods. Since that attempt, the cluster
hasn't changed in a way that could make those Pods schedulable.</li>
<li>The Pods are blocked from entering the scheduling cycles by PreEnqueue Plugins,
for example, they have a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/#configuring-pod-schedulinggates">scheduling gate</a>,
and get blocked by the scheduling gate plugin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scheduling-framework-and-plugins">Scheduling framework and plugins</h2>
<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is implemented following the Kubernetes
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/">scheduling framework</a>.</p>
<p>And, all scheduling features are implemented as plugins
(e.g., <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity">Pod affinity</a>
is implemented in the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin.)</p>
<p>The scheduler processes pending Pods in phases called <em>cycles</em> as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheduling cycle</strong>: the scheduler takes pending Pods from the activeQ component of the scheduling
queue <em>one by one</em>. For each Pod, the scheduler runs the filtering/scoring logic from every scheduling plugin. The
scheduler then decides on the best node for the Pod, or decides that the Pod can't be scheduled at that time.</p>
<p>If the scheduler decides that a Pod can't be scheduled, that Pod enters the Unschedulable Pod Pool
component of the scheduling queue. However, if the scheduler decides to place the Pod on a node,
the Pod goes to the binding cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Binding cycle</strong>: the scheduler communicates the node placement decision to the Kubernetes API
server. This operation bounds the Pod to the selected node.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aside from some exceptions, most unscheduled Pods enter the unschedulable pod pool after each scheduling
cycle. The Unschedulable Pod Pool component is crucial because of how the scheduling cycle processes Pods one by one. If the scheduler had to constantly retry placing unschedulable Pods, instead of offloading those
Pods to the Unschedulable Pod Pool, multiple scheduling cycles would be wasted on those Pods.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-to-retrying-pod-scheduling-with-queuinghint">Improvements to retrying Pod scheduling with QueuingHint</h2>
<p>Unschedulable Pods only move back into the ActiveQ or BackoffQ components of the scheduling
queue if changes in the cluster might allow the scheduler to place those Pods on nodes.</p>
<p>Prior to v1.32, each plugin registered which cluster changes could solve their failures, an object creation, update, or deletion in the cluster (called <em>cluster events</em>),
with <code>EnqueueExtensions</code> (<code>EventsToRegister</code>),
and the scheduling queue retries a pod with an event that is registered by a plugin that rejected the pod in a previous scheduling cycle.</p>
<p>Additionally, we had an internal feature called <code>preCheck</code>, which helped further filtering of events for efficiency, based on Kubernetes core scheduling constraints;
For example, <code>preCheck</code> could filter out node-related events when the node status is <code>NotReady</code>.</p>
<p>However, we had two issues for those approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requeueing with events was too broad, could lead to scheduling retries for no reason.
<ul>
<li>A new scheduled Pod <em>might</em> solve the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>'s failure, but not all of them do.
For example, if a new Pod is created, but without a label matching <code>InterPodAffinity</code> of the unschedulable pod, the pod wouldn't be schedulable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>preCheck</code> relied on the logic of in-tree plugins and was not extensible to custom plugins,
like in issue <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110175">#110175</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here QueueingHints come into play;
a QueueingHint subscribes to a particular kind of cluster event, and make a decision about whether each incoming event could make the Pod schedulable.</p>
<p>For example, consider a Pod named <code>pod-a</code> that has a required Pod affinity. <code>pod-a</code> was rejected in
the scheduling cycle by the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin because no node had an existing Pod that matched
the Pod affinity specification for <code>pod-a</code>.</p>
<figure>

alt="A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin"/> <figcaption>
<p>A diagram showing the scheduling queue and pod-a rejected by InterPodAffinity plugin</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><code>pod-a</code> moves into the Unschedulable Pod Pool. The scheduling queue records which plugin caused
the scheduling failure for the Pod. For <code>pod-a</code>, the scheduling queue records that the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>
plugin rejected the Pod.</p>
<p><code>pod-a</code> will never be schedulable until the InterPodAffinity failure is resolved.
There're some scenarios that the failure could be resolved, one example is an existing running pod gets a label update and becomes matching a Pod affinity.
For this scenario, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code> plugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> callback function checks every Pod label update that occurs in the cluster.
Then, if a Pod gets a label update that matches the Pod affinity requirement of <code>pod-a</code>, the <code>InterPodAffinity</code>,
plugin's <code>QueuingHint</code> prompts the scheduling queue to move <code>pod-a</code> back into the ActiveQ or
the BackoffQ component.</p>

<h2 id="queueinghint-s-history-and-what-s-new-in-v1-32">QueueingHint's history and what's new in v1.32</h2>
<p>At SIG Scheduling, we have been working on the development of QueueingHint since
Kubernetes v1.28.</p>
<p>While QueuingHint isn't user-facing, we implemented the <code>SchedulerQueueingHints</code> feature gate as a
safety measure when we originally added this feature. In v1.28, we implemented QueueingHints with a
few in-tree plugins experimentally, and made the feature gate enabled by default.</p>
<p>However, users reported a memory leak, and consequently we disabled the feature gate in a
patch release of v1.28. From v1.28 until v1.31, we kept working on the QueueingHint implementation
within the rest of the in-tree plugins and fixing bugs.</p>
<p>In v1.32, we made this feature enabled by default again. We finished implementing QueueingHints
in all plugins and also identified the cause of the memory leak!</p>
<p>We thank all the contributors who participated in the development of this feature and those who reported and investigated the earlier issues.</p>

              <p>Russian nation-state hackers have followed an unusual path to gather intel in the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine—appropriating the infrastructure of fellow threat actors and using it to infect electronic devices its adversary’s military personnel are using on the front line.</p>

In one case, Secret Blizzard—the name Microsoft uses to track the group—leveraged the infrastructure of a cybercrime group tracked as Storm-1919. In the other, Secret Blizzard appropriated resources of Storm-1837, a Russia-based threat actor with a history of targeting Ukrainian drone operators.</p>
<p>The more common means for initial access by Secret Blizzard is spear phishing followed by lateral movement through server-side and edge device compromises.

From a report: Jules was introduced today alongside Gemini 2.0, and uses the updated Google AI model to create multi-step plans to address issues, modify multiple files, and prepare pull requests for Python and Javascript coding tasks in GitHub workflows. 

Microsoft introduced a similar experience for GitHub Copilot last year that can recognize and explain code, alongside recommending changes and fixing bugs. Jules will compete against Microsoft's offering, and also against tools like Cursor and even Claude and ChatGPT's coding abilities. Google's launch of a coding-focused AI assistant is no surprise -- CEO Sundar Pichai said in October that more than a quarter of all new code at the company is now generated by AI. 

"Jules handles bug fixes and other time-consuming tasks while you focus on what you actually want to build," Google says in its blog post. "This effort is part of our long-term goal of building AI agents that are helpful in all domains, including coding."<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

In the pursuit of athletic excellence, the Greeks developed ideas and methods that are still remarkably applicable to the present day. Such fundamental fitness concepts as a proper warm-up and cool-down have their origins in the sandy gymnasiums of Athens and Sparta. While the dress code of the modern gym is a little stricter, the lessons gleaned from those ancient workouts are well worth a look.

LLMs have ushered in an unmistakable supercycle in the world of technology. The low-hanging use cases have largely been picked off. The next frontier will be AI coworkers who sit alongside knowledge workers, doing work side by side. At the infrastructure level, one of the most important primitives invented by man - the data center, is being fundamentally rethought in this new wave.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

There were 656 mass shootings in the United States in 2023. The one in October in Lewiston, Maine — where an Army reservist killed 18 people and wounded 13 — was the year’s deadliest. 
In “Breakdown in Maine,” FRONTLINE and its Local Journalism Initiative partners the Portland Press Herald and Maine Public examine a series of missteps by the military, local law enforcement and mental health providers before the tragedy. The documentary probes Maine’s unique gun laws and details the shooter’s brain injuries, possibly sustained during his time as an Army grenade instructor. It also examines the devastating impact of the shooting, including on Maine’s Deaf community, which lost four people that day.

“Whose fault is it? Who do we blame?” asks Megan Vozzella, whose husband, Steve, was killed in the shooting. “It makes me angry. He could have been stopped.”

Breakdown in Maine is a FRONTLINE production with Storyboard Studios LLC.  The director is Bronwyn Berry. The producer is James Blue. The writers are Bronwyn Berry and James Blue. The journalists from the Portland Press Herald are Julia Arenstam and John Terhune; and from Maine Public, Steve Mistler and Susan Sharon. The CEO and Publisher of the Maine Trust for Local News/Portland Press Herald is Lisa DeSisto. The President and CEO of Maine Public is Rick Schneider. The senior editor of FRONTLINE’s Local Journalism Initiative is Erin Texeira. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

Seth Larson, security developer-in-residence at the Python Software Foundation, raised the issue in a blog post last week, urging those reporting bugs not to use AI systems for bug hunting. 

"Recently I've noticed an uptick in extremely low-quality, spammy, and LLM-hallucinated security reports to open source projects," he wrote, pointing to similar findings from the Curl project in January. "These reports appear at first glance to be potentially legitimate and thus require time to refute." Larson argued that low-quality reports should be treated as if they're malicious. 

As if to underscore the persistence of these concerns, a Curl project bug report posted on December 8 shows that nearly a year after maintainer Daniel Stenberg raised the issue, he's still confronted by "AI slop" -- and wasting his time arguing with a bug submitter who may be partially or entirely automated.<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

and reflect on the last 10 years of Kubernetes and our accomplishments:
each release cycle is a journey, and just like Penelope, in &quot;The Odyssey&quot;,<br>
weaved for 10 years -- each night removing parts of what she had done during the day --
so does each release add new features and removes others, albeit here with a much
clearer purpose of constantly improving Kubernetes.
With v1.32 being the last release in the year Kubernetes marks its first decade anniversary,
we wanted to honour all of those that have been part of the global Kubernetes crew
that roams the cloud-native seas through perils and challanges:
may we continue to weave the future of Kubernetes together.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-recent-key-features">Updates to recent key features</h2>
<h3 id="a-note-on-dra-enhancements">A note on DRA enhancements</h3>
<p>In this release, like the previous one, the Kubernetes project continues proposing a number of enhancements to the
Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a key component of the Kubernetes resource management system. These enhancements aim
to improve the flexibility and efficiency of resource allocation for workloads that require specialized hardware, such
as GPUs, FPGAs and network adapters.
These features are particularly useful for use-cases such as machine learning or high-performance computing
applications. The core part enabling DRA Structured parameter support <a href="#structured-parameter-support">got promoted to beta</a>.</p>
<h3 id="quality-of-life-improvements-on-nodes-and-sidecar-containers-update">Quality of life improvements on nodes and sidecar containers update</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG Node</a> has the following highlights that go beyond
KEPs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The systemd watchdog capability is now used to restart the kubelet when its health check fails, while also limiting
the maximum number of restarts within a given time period. This enhances the reliability of the kubelet. For more
details, see pull request <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127566">#127566</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cases when an image pull back-off error is encountered, the message displayed in the Pod status has been improved
to be more human-friendly and to indicate details about why the Pod is in this condition.
When an image pull back-off occurs, the error is appended to the <code>status.containerStatuses[*].state.waiting.message</code>
field in the Pod specification with an <code>ImagePullBackOff</code> value in the <code>reason</code> field. This change provides you with
more context and helps you to identify the root cause of the issue. For more details, see pull request
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/127918">#127918</a>.</p>

<h3 id="structured-parameter-support">Structured parameter support</h3>
<p>The core part of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), the structured parameter support, got promoted to beta.
This allows the kube-scheduler and Cluster Autoscaler to simulate claim allocation directly, without needing a
third-party driver.
These components can now predict whether resource requests can be fulfilled based on the cluster's current state without actually
committing to the allocation. By eliminating the need for a third-party driver to validate or test allocations, this
feature improves planning and decision-making for resource distribution, making the scheduling and scaling processes
more efficient.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381">KEP #4381</a>, by WG Device
Management (a cross functional team containing <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG Node</a>,

<h2 id="highlights-of-new-features-in-alpha">Highlights of new features in Alpha</h2>
<p><em>This is a selection of key improvements introduced as alpha features in the v1.32 release.</em></p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-preemption-in-the-kubernetes-scheduler">Asynchronous preemption in the Kubernetes Scheduler</h3>
<p>The Kubernetes scheduler has been enhanced with Asynchronous Preemption, a feature that improves scheduling throughput
by handling preemption operations asynchronously. Preemption ensures higher-priority pods get the resources they need by
evicting lower-priority ones, but this process previously involved heavy operations like API calls to delete pods,
slowing down the scheduler. With this enhancement, such tasks are now processed in parallel, allowing the scheduler to
continue scheduling other pods without delays.
This improvement is particularly beneficial in clusters with high Pod churn or frequent scheduling failures, ensuring a
more efficient and resilient scheduling process.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of KEP <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4832">#4832</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-scheduling">SIG Scheduling</a>.</p>
<h3 id="mutating-admission-policies-using-cel-expressions">Mutating admission policies using CEL expressions</h3>
<p>This feature leverages CEL's object instantiation and JSON Patch strategies, combined with Server Side Apply’s merge
algorithms. It simplifies policy definition, reduces mutation conflicts, and enhances admission control performance
while laying a foundation for more robust, extensible policy frameworks in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The Kubernetes API server now supports Common Expression Language (CEL)-based Mutating Admission Policies, providing a
lightweight, efficient alternative to mutating admission webhooks. With this enhancement, administrators can use CEL to
declare mutations like setting labels, defaulting fields, or injecting sidecars with simple, declarative expressions.
This approach reduces operational complexity, eliminates the need for webhooks, and integrates directly with the
kube-apiserver, offering faster and more reliable in-process mutation handling.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3962">KEP #3962</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery">SIG API
Machinery</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pod-level-resource-specifications">Pod-level resource specifications</h3>
<p>This enhancement simplifies resource management in Kubernetes by introducing the ability to set resource requests and
limits at the Pod level, creating a shared pool that all containers in the Pod can dynamically use. This is particularly
valuable for workloads with containers that have fluctuating or bursty resource needs, as it minimizes over-provisioning
and improves overall resource efficiency.</p>
<p>By leveraging Linux cgroup settings at the Pod level, Kubernetes ensures that these resource limits are enforced while
enabling tightly coupled containers to collaborate more effectively without hitting artificial constraints. Importantly,
this feature maintains backward compatibility with existing container-level resource settings, allowing users to adopt
it incrementally without disrupting current workflows or existing configurations.</p>
<p>This marks a significant improvement for multi-container pods, as it reduces the operational complexity of managing
resource allocations across containers. It also provides a performance boost for tightly integrated applications, such
as sidecar architectures, where containers share workloads or depend on each other’s availability to perform optimally.</p>
<p>This work was done as part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2837">KEP #2837</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG
Node</a>.</p>
<h3 id="allow-zero-value-for-sleep-action-of-prestop-hook">Allow zero value for sleep action of PreStop hook</h3>
<p>This enhancement introduces the ability to set a zero-second sleep duration for the PreStop lifecycle hook in
Kubernetes, offering a more flexible and no-op option for resource validation and customization. Previously, attempting
to define a zero value for the sleep action resulted in validation errors, restricting its use. With this update, users
can configure a zero-second duration as a valid sleep setting, enabling immediate execution and termination behaviors
where needed.</p>
<p>The enhancement is backward-compatible, introduced as an opt-in feature controlled by the
<code>PodLifecycleSleepActionAllowZero</code> feature gate. This change is particularly beneficial for scenarios requiring PreStop
hooks for validation or admission webhook processing without requiring an actual sleep duration. By aligning with the
capabilities of the <code>time.After</code> Go function, this update simplifies configuration and expands usability for Kubernetes
workloads.</p>
<p>This work was done as part of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4818">KEP #4818</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-node">SIG

<h3 id="dra-standardized-network-interface-data-for-resource-claim-status">DRA: Standardized network interface data for resource claim status</h3>
<p>This enhancement adds a new field that allows drivers to report specific device status data for each allocated object
in a ResourceClaim. It also establishes a standardized way to represent networking devices information.</p>
<p>This work was done as a part of
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4817">KEP #4817</a>, by
<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network">SIG Network</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-statusz-and-flagz-endpoints-for-core-components">New statusz and flagz endpoints for core components</h3>
<p>You can enable two new HTTP endpoints, <code>/statusz</code> and <code>/flagz</code>, for core components.
These enhance cluster debuggability by gaining insight into what versions (e.g. Golang version) that component is
running as, along with details about its uptime, and which command line flags that component was executed with;
making it easier to diagnose both runtime and configuration issues.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-instrumentation">SIG Instrumentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="windows-strikes-back">Windows strikes back!</h3>
<p>Support for graceful shutdowns of Windows nodes in Kubernetes clusters has been added.
Before this release, Kubernetes provided graceful node shutdown functionality for Linux nodes
but lacked equivalent support for Windows. This enhancement enables the kubelet on Windows nodes to handle system
shutdown events properly. Doing so, it ensures that Pods running on Windows nodes are gracefully terminated,
allowing workloads to be rescheduled without disruption. This improvement enhances the reliability and stability
of clusters that include Windows nodes, especially during a planned maintenance or any system updates.</p>
<p>Moreover CPU and memory affinity support has been added for Windows nodes with nodes, with improvements
to the CPU manager, memory manager and topology manager.</p>

<h3 id="deprecations-and-removals">Deprecations and removals</h3>
<p>As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project's
overall health.
See the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/">deprecation and removal policy</a> for more details on
this process.</p>
<h4 id="withdrawal-of-the-old-dra-implementation">Withdrawal of the old DRA implementation</h4>
<p>The enhancement <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063">#3063</a> introduced Dynamic Resource Allocation
(DRA) in Kubernetes 1.26.</p>
<p>However, in Kubernetes v1.32, this approach to DRA will be significantly changed. Code related to the original
implementation will be removed, leaving KEP <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/4381">#4381</a> as the &quot;new&quot;
base functionality.</p>
<p>The decision to change the existing approach originated from its incompatibility with cluster autoscaling as resource
availability was non-transparent, complicating decision-making for both Cluster Autoscaler and controllers.
The newly added Structured Parameter model substitutes the functionality.</p>
<p>This removal will allow Kubernetes to handle new hardware requirements and resource claims more predictably, bypassing
the complexities of back and forth API calls to the kube-apiserver.</p>
<p>See the enhancement issue <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3063">#3063</a> to find out more.</p>
<h4 id="api-removals">API removals</h4>
<p>There is one API removal in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-32">Kubernetes v1.32</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3</code> API version of FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration has been removed.
To prepare for this, you can edit your existing manifests and rewrite client software to use the
<code>flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1 API</code> version, available since v1.29.
All existing persisted objects are accessible via the new API. Notable changes in flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3
include that the PriorityLevelConfiguration <code>spec.limited.nominalConcurrencyShares</code> field only defaults to 30 when
unspecified, and an explicit value of 0 is not changed to 30.</li>

As part of their crazed dream to create a thousand-year Reich, the Nazis developed detailed blueprints for Aryan settlements and vast hunting parks for ‘Aryan’ animals. Goering and Himmler employed Germany’s best scientists to launch a hugely ambitious programme of genetic manipulation to change the course of nature itself, both in the wild and for domestic use. In a fascinating blend of politics and biology, Hitler's Jurassic Park is the true and astonishing story of how the Nazis tried to take control of nature and change the course of evolution.

Ten years ago, in 2014, we released a video titled "Is War Over?". Back then, the question didn’t seem so naive. It seemed violent conflict was on the decline and the world more peaceful than ever. 
But the last ten years weren’t what we expected. So let's see how our video has held up.Re-watch our 2014 video here: https://kgs.link/war-2014

You can use tools like Flake8, PyLint or Ruff to lint your code. You might use Mypy to verify type checking. There are lots of other tools at your disposal. But it can be hard to remember to do that every time you want to create a pull request (PR) in GitHub or GitLab.</p>
<p>That is where continuous integration (CI) tools come in. GitHub has something called GitHub Actions that allow you to run tools or entire workflows on certain types of events.</p>
<p>In this article, you will learn how to create a <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Action</a> that runs Ruff on a PR. You can learn more about Ruff in my <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/06/28/an-intro-to-ruff-an-extremely-fast-python-linter/">introductory article</a>.</p>
<h2>Creating a Workflow</h2>
<p>In the root folder of your code, you will need to create a folder called <strong>.github/workflows</strong>. Note the period at the beginning and the fact that you need a subfolder named <strong>workflows</strong> too. Inside of that, you will create a YAML file.</p>
<p>Since you are going to run Ruff to lint and format your Python files, you can call this YAML file <strong>ruff.yml. </strong>Put the following in your new file:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">name: Ruff
on: [workflow_dispatch, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.13"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install ruff
      # Include `--format=github` to enable automatic inline annotations.
      - name: Run Ruff
        run: ruff check --output-format=github .
        continue-on-error: false
      - name: Run Ruff format
        run: ruff format --check .
        continue-on-error: false</pre>
<p>Note: This example comes from my <a href="https://github.com/driscollis/textual-cogs/blob/main/.github/workflows/ruff.yml">textual-cogs repo</a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what this does. This line is pretty important:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">on: [workflow_dispatch, pull_request]</pre>
<p>It tells GitHub to run this workflow when there&#8217;s a pull request and also with &#8220;workflow_dispatch&#8221;. That second option lets you go to the <strong>Actions</strong> tab in your GitHub repo, select the workflow and run it manually. If you do not include that, you cannot run it manually at all. This is useful for testing purposes, but you can remove it if you do not need it.</p>
<p>The next part tells GitHub to run the build on ubuntu-linux:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest</pre>
<p>If you have a GitHub subscription, you can also get Windows as a runner, which means that you can also run these actions on Windows in addition to Linux.</p>
<p>The steps section is the meat of this particular workflow:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="yaml">steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Install Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    with:
      python-version: "3.13"
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install ruff
  # Include `--format=github` to enable automatic inline annotations.
  - name: Run Ruff
    run: ruff check --output-format=github .
    continue-on-error: false
  - name: Run Ruff format
    run: ruff format --check .
    continue-on-error: false</pre>
<p>Here is uses a built-in <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">checkout@v4 workflow</a>, which is something that comes with GitHub. There are many others you can use to enhance your workflows and add new functionality. Next, you get setup with Python 3.13 and then you install your dependencies.</p>
<p>Once your dependencies are installed, you can run your tools. In this case, you are installing and running Ruff. For every PR, you run <code>ruff check --output-format=github .</code>, which will do all sorts of linting on your Python code. If any errors are found, it will add inline comments with the error, which is what that <code>--output-format</code> flag is for.</p>
<p>You also have a separate section to run Ruff format, which will format your code to follow the <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a> formatter (for the most part).</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>You can add lots of other tools to your workflows too. For example, you might add a Mypy workflow, or some test workflows to run on PR or perhaps before merging to your main branch. You might even want to check your <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/09/20/learning-about-code-metrics-in-python-with-radon/">code complexity</a> before allowing a merge too!</p>
<p>With a little work, you will soon be able to use GitHub Actions to keep your code cleaner and make it more uniform too. Adding automated testing is even better! Give it a try and let me know what you think.</p>

From its storytelling and worldbuilding to the technical prowess behind its interconnected world and innovative Realm shifting, developer Crystal Dynamics created a near-masterpiece of environmental and narrative design, with ideas and concepts that still resonate to this day.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, 25 years later--and 21 years since the last game in the series--Legacy of Kain makes its overdue return with Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered, bundling together two of the greatest action-adventure games of all time. Developed in partnership with Crystal Dynamics and Aspyr--the latter of which recently launched the similarly packaged Tomb Raider I-III Remastered--this bundle reintroduces the world to vampire protagonist Raziel and his quest for revenge against the eponymous Kain. With improved visuals and a modern control scheme, it's a solid remaster that, above all, showcases why these games are so revered.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the decaying land of Nosgoth--where vampires are apex predators and humans cower within walled cities--the first Soul Reaver begins with Raziel committing the sin of surpassing his master, Kain, in evolution. As the self-proclaimed king of Nosgoth, Kain sired and raised Raziel as his eldest lieutenant and son, tasking him and his four brothers with besieging the land and decimating humanity to ensure his despotic rule. By growing a set of wings, however, Raziel is deemed to have threatened Kain's supremacy and is thrown into the Lake of the Dead to suffer for all eternity. After rotting for centuries, Raziel is resurrected by a dormant god and set on a path of vengeance to seek out his brothers and kill them before doing the same to Kain.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-12-remastered-review-my-wayward-son-returns/1900-6418324/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MySQL Change root Password Command</title><link>https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/mysql-change-root-password/</link><author>Vivek Gite</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 9 Dec 2024 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cyberciti.biz/atom/">Dev - NixCraft</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div style="float: right; margin-top: 0; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/category/mysql/" title="See all MySQL Database Server related FAQ"><img alt="See all MySQL Database Server related FAQ" border="0" height="52" src="https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/category/old/mysqllogo.gif" width="100"/></a></div>

After all, it was a band of color-coordinated heroes who traded gentle quips and used martial arts to dispatch endless faceless baddies. I watched MMPR at the time, but I was also just cresting the age at which I felt a little embarrassed by its undeniable camp. Three decades later, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind once again feels a bit like it's riding the turtles' coattails. TMNT: Shredder's Revenge was an excellent retro brawler throwback, and by comparison, Rita's Rewind is a <em>pretty good</em> retro brawler throwback, but one with some of its own special charms--as well as its own frustrations.</p><p dir="ltr">Rita's Rewind fully recognizes the passage of time, even pinning down specific years. The original Rangers are still fighting evil in 2023, now against a mechanized Robo Rita--a timely reference to the villain of the reunion movie, 2023's Power Rangers: Once and Always. But apparently overwhelmed by these Rangers who have decades of experience, Robo Rita hatches a plan to go back in time and team up with her flesh-and-blood self. The modern-day Rangers say it's too dangerous to follow her through time and risk a paradox, so they just have to hope their younger selves are able to withstand the machinations of two Ritas.</p><p dir="ltr">That places Rita's Rewind strictly on the 1993 timeline, which means it's the first time the Rangers are encountering mainstays like Goldar and the Green Ranger. The only real difference is that this time we see Rita Repulsa bickering with Robo Rita over strategy.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-the-90s-sure-were-weird/1900-6418325/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JupyterLab 101 Book is Now Available</title><link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2024/12/09/jupyterlab-101-book-is-now-available/</link><author>Mike</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 9 Dec 2024 13:31:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/">Dev - Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JupyterLab, the latest iteration of the Jupyter Notebook, is a versatile tool that empowers you to share your code in an easily understandable format.</p>

One thing is clear: The roughly 75 million people who voted for Trump were saying “no” to lots of things.

But what were they saying “yes” to?

In this excerpt from The Gray Area podcast, Sean Illing and Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp try to figure out whether Trumpism is a movement or just a moment. Is it a political ideology that we’ll reckon with for years to come, or just a collection of whims from the most powerful man in the world? And what does it mean for the country’s political future?

Beauchamp is the author of The Reactionary Spirit: How America's Most Insidious Political Tradition Swept the World. It’s a book about democracy and the contradictions and conflicts at the heart of it. https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/?lens=publicaffairs

Renowned Linux kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced Thursday that the Linux 6.12 kernel series has been officially marked as LTS (Long Term Support) on the kernel.org website with a predicted life expectancy of at least two years. 

Linux kernel 6.12 was released on November 17th, 2024, and introduces new features like real-time "PREEMPT_RT" support, a new scheduler called sched_ext, and DRM panic messages as QR codes, as well as numerous new and updated drivers for better hardware support... 

Linux kernel 6.12 joins the many other long-term support kernel branches, namely Linux 6.6 LTS, Linux 6.1 LTS, Linux 5.15 LTS, Linux 5.10 LTS, and Linux 5.4 LTS. Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.

English</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/08/2154224/thanks-to-ai-the-hottest-new-programming-language-is-english?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 8 Dec 2024 21:57:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Generative AI is transforming software development by enabling natural language prompts to generate code, reducing the need for traditional programming skills," argues Analytics India magazine.


Traditionally, coding was the bastion of the select few who had mastered mighty languages like C++, Python, or Java. The idea of programming seemed exclusively reserved for those fluent in syntax and logic. However, the narrative is now being challenged by natural language coding being implemented in AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla predicted this trend last year.... English is emerging as the universal coding language. 

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes that English is becoming a new programming language thanks to AI advancements. Speaking at the World Government Summit, Huang explained, "It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human"... He calls this a "miracle of AI," emphasising how it closes the technology divide and empowers people from all fields to become effective technologists without traditional coding skills... "In the future, you will tell the computer what you want, and it will do it,"&#226; Huang commented. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and its successors have made this possible... 


Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been equally vocal about the potential of English for coding. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, an AI code assistant, enables developers to describe their needs in natural language and receive functional code in response. Nadella describes this as part of a broader mission to "empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more".... In a discussion earlier last year, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque claimed, "41% of codes on GitHub are AI-generated"... 

In 2024, the ability to program is no longer reserved for a few. It's a skill anyone can wield, thanks to the power of natural language processing and AI
 
"No longer is the power to create software restricted to those who can decipher programming languages," the article concludes. "Anyone with a problem to solve and a clear enough articulation of that problem can now write software." 

Although the article also includes this consoling quote from Nvidia's Huang in March. "There is an artistry to prompt engineering. It's how you fine-tune the instructions to get exactly what you want"<p><div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;">

Instead the geek tradition of programming-language advent calendars "seems to have started way back in 2000," according to one history, "when London-based programmer Mark Fowler launched a calendar highlighting a different Perl module each day." 
So the tradition continues...

Nearly a quarter of a century later, there's still a Perl Advent Calendar, celebrating tips and tricks like "a few special packages waiting under the tree that can give your web applications a little extra pep in their step."
And of course there's a separate advent calendar for Raku programmers.
Since 2009 web performance consultant (and former Yahoo and Facebook engineer) Stoyan Stefanov has been pulling together an annual Web Performance calendar with helpful blog posts. 
There's also a JVM Advent calendar with daily helpful hints for Java programmers.
Another advent calendar promises daily posts about C#.
The HTMHell site &mdash; which bills itself as "a collection of bad practices in HTML, copied from real websites" &mdash; is celebrating the season with the "HTMHell Advent Calendar," promising daily articles on security, accessibility, UX, and performance.
There's even an advent calendar with tips for the reverse-engineering framework Radar.
There's still a lovely web-design themed calendar at Designcember.com.


And meanwhile developers at the Svelte frontend framework are actually promising to release something new each day, "whether it's a new feature in Svelte or SvelteKit or an improvement to the website!" 


But not every tech advent calendar is about programming...

Adafruit's managing director is publishing a Retrocomputing Advent Calendar &mdash; daily looks at the ghosts of computers past.

The Atlantic continues its 17-year tradition of a Space Telescope advent calendar, featuring daily images from both NASA's Hubble telescope and James Webb Space Telescope
The gaming blog Rock Paper Shotgun has been counting down their favorite games of 2024...

This change has allowed me to embrace simplicity and question the endless pursuit of ambition that capitalism often glorifies. I dive into the importance of balancing work, self-actualization, and community while challenging societal pressures around success and jobs.

Join me as I explore how shifting ambitions toward personal happiness and freedom has redefined my creative journey. This is about slowing down, finding meaning, and creating with purpose.

The gateway processes these requests, enforces security, and forwards them to the appropriate microservices.</p><p>In this article, we will explore why do we need an API gateway, the key features it provides and how it works step by step.</p><div><hr></div><h2>&#128227; <a href="https://dub.link/algo-dec7">Improve your Product Skills - PostHog Newsletter (Sponsored)</a></h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png" width="1456" height="291" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:291,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d129404-a78c-4422-b045-1b6852bdded9_2200x440.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong><a href="https://dub.link/algo-dec7">Product for Engineers</a></strong> is PostHog&#8217;s newsletter dedicated to helping engineers improve their product skills.

<strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong></h4><p>API Gateway secures the backend systems by ensuring only authorized users and clients can access backend services.</p><p>It handles tasks like:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Verifying the identity of the client using tokens (e.g., OAuth, JWT), API keys, or certificates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Authorization:</strong> Checking the client&#8217;s permissions to access specific services or resources.</p></li></ul><p>By centralizing these tasks, the API gateway eliminates the need for individual services to handle authentication, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistent access control across the system.</p><h4>2. <strong>Rate Limiting</strong></h4><p>To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources, most API Gateways implement <strong>rate limiting</strong>.</p><p>This feature:</p><ul><li><p>Controls the frequency of requests a client can make within a given timeframe.</p></li><li><p>Protects backend services from being overwhelmed by excessive traffic or potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>For example, a public API might allow a maximum of 100 requests per minute per user. If a client exceeds this limit, the API Gateway will block additional requests until the rate resets.</p></blockquote><h4>3. <strong>Load Balancing</strong></h4><p>High-traffic applications rely on <strong>load balancing</strong> to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple instances of a service. </p><p>The API Gateway can:</p><ul><li><p>Redirect requests to healthy service instances while avoiding ones that are down or overloaded.</p></li><li><p>Use algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or weighted distribution to manage traffic intelligently.</p></li></ul><h4>4. <strong>Caching</strong></h4><p>To improve response times and reduce the strain on backend services, most API Gateways provide <strong>caching</strong>. </p><p>They temporarily store frequently requested data, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Responses to commonly accessed endpoints (e.g., product catalogs or weather data).</p></li><li><p>Static resources like images or metadata.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Caching helps in reducing latency and enhancing user experience while lowering the operational cost of backend services.</p></blockquote><h4>5. <strong>Request Transformation</strong></h4><p>In systems with diverse clients and backend services, <strong>request transformation</strong> is essential for compatibility.</p><p>An API Gateway can:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the structure or format of incoming requests to match the backend service requirements.</p></li><li><p>Transform responses before sending them back to the client, ensuring they meet the client&#8217;s expectations.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>For instance, it might convert XML responses from a legacy service into JSON for modern frontend applications.</p></blockquote><h4>6. <strong>Service Discovery</strong></h4><p>Modern systems often involve microservices that scale dynamically. </p><p>The <strong>service discovery</strong> feature of an API Gateway dynamically identifies the appropriate backend service instance to handle each request.</p><p>This ensures seamless request routing even in environments where services frequently scale up or down.</p><h4>7. <strong>Circuit Breaking</strong></h4><p>Circuit breaking is a mechanism that temporarily stops sending requests to a backend service when it detects persistent failures, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Slow responses or timeouts.</p></li><li><p>Server errors (e.g., HTTP 500 status codes).</p></li><li><p>High latency or unavailability of a service.</p></li></ul><p>The API Gateway continuously monitors the health and performance of backend services and uses circuit breaking to block requests to a failing service.</p><h4>8. <strong>Logging and Monitoring </strong></h4><p>API Gateways provide robust <strong>monitoring and logging</strong> capabilities to track and analyze system behavior.</p><p>These capabilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Logging detailed information about each request, such as source, destination, and response time.</p></li><li><p>Collecting metrics like request rates, error rates, and latency.</p></li></ul><p>This data helps system administrators detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the system&#8217;s performance. Many API Gateways also integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch.</p><h2><strong>3. How Does an API Gateway Work?</strong></h2><p>Imagine you're using a food delivery app to order dinner. When you tap "Place Order" your phone makes an API request. But instead of talking directly to various backend services, it communicates with an API Gateway first.</p><h4><strong>Step 1: Request Reception</strong></h4><p>When you tap "Place Order," the app sends a request to the <strong>API Gateway</strong>, asking it to process your order. </p><p>This request includes things like:</p><ul><li><p>Your user ID</p></li><li><p>Selected restaurant and menu items</p></li><li><p>Delivery address</p></li><li><p>Payment method</p></li><li><p>Authentication tokens</p></li></ul><p>The API Gateway receives the request as the single entry point to the backend system.</p><h4><strong>Step 2: Request Validation</strong></h4><p>Before forwarding the request, the API Gateway validates it to ensure:</p><ul><li><p>The required parameters or headers are present.</p></li><li><p>The data is in the correct format (e.g., JSON).</p></li><li><p>The request conforms to the expected structure or schema.</p></li></ul><pre><code>// Example of initial request handling
app.post('/api/v1/orders', async (req, res) =&gt; {
    // Check if request has required headers
    if (!req.headers['content-type'].includes('application/json')) {
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid content type');
    }
    // Continue processing...
});</code></pre><p>If any information is missing or incorrect, the gateway immediately rejects the request and notifies the app  with an appropriate error message.</p><h4><strong>Step 3: Authentication &amp; Authorization</strong></h4><p>The gateway now verifies your identity and permissions to ensures only legitimate users can place orders:</p><ul><li><p>It forwards your authentication token (e.g., OAuth or JWT) to an identity provider to confirm your identity.</p></li><li><p>It checks your permissions to ensure you&#8217;re authorized to use the app for placing an order.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const authenticateRequest = async (req) =&gt; {
    // Extract JWT token from header
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    
    // Verify token and get user details
    const user = await verifyToken(token);
    
    // Check if user has permission to place orders
    return user.permissions.includes('place_orders');
};</code></pre><p>If authentication or authorization fails, the API Gateway sends a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> or <code>403 Forbidden</code> error back to the app.</p><h4><strong>Step 4: Rate Limiting</strong></h4><p>To prevent abuse, the API Gateway checks how many requests you&#8217;ve made recently. For example:</p><ul><li><p>If you&#8217;ve made 10 "Place Order" requests in the last minute (maybe by accident), the gateway might block additional requests temporarily and return <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const checkRateLimit = async (userId) =&gt; {
    const key = `rate_limit:order:${userId}`;
    const current = await redis.incr(key);
    
    // If first request in window, set expiry
    if (current === 1) {
        await redis.expire(key, 60); // 1 minute window
    }
    
    return current &lt;= 10; // Allow 10 order requests per minute
};</code></pre><p>This ensures the system remains stable and fair for all users specially during traffic spikes or malicious attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attempts.</p><h4><strong>Step 5: Request Transformation (if needed)</strong></h4><p>If any of these backend services require specific data formats or additional details, the API Gateway transforms the request. </p><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>The app sends the delivery address in plain text, but the Delivery Service expects GPS coordinates. The API Gateway converts the address into coordinates before forwarding the request.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const transformRequest = async (originalRequest) =&gt; {
    const address = originalRequest.deliveryAddress;

    // Convert address to GPS coordinates using a geocoding API
    const coordinates = await getCoordinatesFromAddress(address);

    if (!coordinates) {
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch GPS coordinates');
    }

    // Transform the request for the Delivery Service
    return {
        orderId: originalRequest.orderId,
        customerName: originalRequest.customerName,
        deliveryLocation: {
            latitude: coordinates.lat,
            longitude: coordinates.lng
        },
        deliveryInstructions: originalRequest.instructions || ""
    };
};</code></pre><h4>Step 6: Request Routing</h4><p>The API Gateway now needs to coordinate several backend services to process your order.</p><p>Using <strong>service discovery</strong>, it identifies:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Order Service:</strong> To create a new order record.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inventory Service:</strong> To check if the restaurant has your selected items available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment Service:</strong> To process your payment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delivery Service:</strong> To assign a delivery driver to your order.</p></li></ul><p>The gateway dynamically routes the request to these services using a <strong>load balancing</strong> algorithm, ensuring it connects to available and healthy service instances.</p><pre><code>const routeRequest = async (req, serviceType) =&gt; {
    // Get service registry
    const services = await serviceDiscovery.getServices(serviceType);
    
    // Select instance
    const targetService = selectServiceInstance(services);
    
    // Forward request
    return await axios.post(
        `${targetService.url}/api/orders`,
        req.body,
        { headers: req.headers }
    );
};</code></pre><h4><strong>Step 7: Response Handling</strong></h4><p>Once the API Gateway receives the response(s) from the backend service(s), it performs the following tasks:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transformation:</strong> Adjusts the response format or structure to match the client&#8217;s requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caching (Optional):</strong> Stores the response temporarily for frequently accessed data, reducing future latency.</p></li></ul><pre><code>const handleResponse = async (serviceResponse) =&gt; {
    // Transform response if needed
    const transformedResponse = {
        orderId: serviceResponse.order_reference,
        estimatedDelivery: serviceResponse.eta,
        status: serviceResponse.current_status
    };
    
    // Cache response if applicable
    if (serviceResponse.cacheable) {
        await cacheResponse(
            transformedResponse.orderId, 
            transformedResponse
        );
    }
    
    return transformedResponse;
};</code></pre><p>Finally, the API Gateway sends the processed response back to the client in a format they can easily understand.</p><h4>Step 8: Logging &amp; Monitoring</h4><p>Throughout this process, the gateway records important metrics to track each request:</p><pre><code>const logRequest = async (req, res, timing) =&gt; {
    await logger.log({
        timestamp: new Date(),
        path: req.path,
        method: req.method,
        responseTime: timing,
        statusCode: res.statusCode,
        userId: req.user?.id
    });
};</code></pre><div><hr></div><p>Hope you enjoyed reading this article.</p><p>If you found it valuable, hit a like &#10084;&#65039; and consider subscribing for more such content every week.</p><p>If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.</p><div class="captioned-button-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/how-i-mastered-data-structures-and-algorithms?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4MzYwMjc0MywicG9zdF9pZCI6MTQ1NjU1MjUyLCJpYXQiOjE3MjE1MjE3MzEsImV4cCI6MTcyNDExMzczMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTIyMDIyNjgiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.2cNY811YEugd5iH9XJQhakBzyahGqF7PcATBlFj5J2w&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">This post is public so feel free to share it.</p></div><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/p/what-is-an-api-gateway?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://blog.algomaster.io/p/what-is-an-api-gateway?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p></div><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://blog.algomaster.io/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe for free to receive new articles every week.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>Checkout my <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ashishps_1/videos">Youtube channel</a></strong> for more in-depth content.</p><p>Follow me on <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishps1/">LinkedIn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ashishps_1">X</a></strong> to stay updated.</p><p>Checkout my <strong><a href="https://github.com/ashishps1">GitHub repositories</a></strong> for free interview preparation resources.</p><p>I hope you have a lovely day!</p><p>See you soon,</p><p>Ashish</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
