So little time is essentially equivalent to simply running the command.Well, it's a combination of a misunderstanding, a misconfiguration, and the suggestion, 17 years ago, of a somewhat questionable unit of time by the Git maintainer himself.How was this designed to work?It's important to note that this is  the default functionality of Git.The  response to typing a command that doesn't exist is to simply not run anything, figure out which commands you might have meant by string similarity and then just exit. If most of you type , you'll probably get this instead:❯ git pushy
git: 'pushy' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
        pushOriginally, if you typed an unknown command, it would just say "this is not a git command". Then in 2008, Johannes Schindelin (somewhat jokingly) introduced a small patch to go through all the known commands, show you what is most similar to what you typed and if there is only one closely matching, simply run it.Then Alex Riesen introduced a patch to make it configurable via the  setting. In this initial patch, this setting was simply a boolean. Since Git config settings that expect a boolean will interpret a  value as , you could originally set  to  to have it automatically run the corrected command rather than just tell you what is similar.As part of the conversation around this patch, Junio Hamano, to this day the Git maintainer, suggested:Please make autocorrect not a binary but optionally the number of
deciseconds before it continues, so that I have a chance to hit ^C ;-)Which was what the setting value was changed to in the patch that was eventually accepted. This means that setting  to  logically means "wait 100ms (1 decisecond) before continuing".Now, why Junio thought  was a reasonable unit of time measurement for this is never discussed, so I don't really know why that is. Perhaps 1 full second felt too long so he wanted to be able to set it to half a second? We may never know. All we truly know is that this has never made sense to anyone ever since., the reason why it waits 100ms for David is that at some point he presumably learned about this setting, quite reasonably assumed that it was a boolean and set it to what Git config also generally considers to be a 'true' value in order to enable it:❯ git config --global help.autocorrect 1Not understanding that in this context, this means "wait 1 decisecond, then do whatever you think is best" rather than "please turn this feature on".So, clearly you can set it to  for a full second or whatever. However, over the years, this setting has gathered a few other options that it will recognize. According to the documentation, here are the values it can be set to:0 (default): show the suggested command.positive number: run the suggested command after specified deciseconds (0.1 sec)."immediate": run the suggested command immediately."prompt": show the suggestion and prompt for confirmation to run the command."never": don’t run or show any suggested command.Honestly, "prompt" is probably what most people would find the most reasonable, rather than a specific amount of time to wait for you to cancel the command.If you  want to have it prompt you, you can run this:❯ git config --global help.autocorrect prompt

❯ git pushy
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'pushy', which does not exist.
Run 'push' instead [y/N]?To keep picking on David, he followed up after doing some quick testing to see what the logic could be and it turns out that Git won't just take wild guesses. There is a point where it will simply assume you're way off and not guess anything:However, it's interesting to play around with this a bit:❯ git bass
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'bass', which does not exist.
Run 'rebase' instead [y/N]? n

❯ git bassa
git: 'bassa' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

❯ git dm
git: 'dm' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar commands are
        am
        rm

❯ git dma
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'dma', which does not exist.
Run 'am' instead [y/N]?So,  is close enough to  for it to guess that this could be what you mean. But  is not close enough for it to  think you maybe meant .Also,  could mean  or , but interestingly it matches on the end of the string and not necessarily from the beginning. Also,  confidently matches .As some of you may have guessed, it's based on a fairly simple, modified Levenshtein distance algorithm - which is basically a way to figure out how expensive it is to change one string into a second string given single character edits, with some operations being more expensive than others. It has a hard coded cutoff, so once it's too expensive for any of the known commands, it just assumes you really messed up, which is why some of these don't match anything and others, even though quite different, match several options.In going through a bunch of the related autocorrect Git code in order to research this little blog post, I realized that there could be a relatively simple and largely backwards compatible fix. Since a  value is so fast, it's in all human terms functionally equivalent to "immediately", I wrote up a small patch to interpret a  as "immediately" rather than "wait 100ms".Junio came back to request that instead of special casing the "1" string, we should properly interpret any boolean string value (so "yes", "no", "true", "off", etc), so version two of my patch is currently in flight to additionally do that. If I can get this landed, maybe future versions of Git will no longer test the mettle of Formula One drivers.Anyhow, hope you enjoyed that little trip down this old alley of seemingly strange Git functionality. As is often the case with Git, there is some hidden method to the apparent madness, and like any open source project, there is a path to make it slightly better!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Reverse Engineering Bambu Connect</title><link>https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Reverse_Engineering_Bambu_Connect</link><author>pabs3</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 03:08:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bambu Connect is an Electron App with Security through Obscurity principles, hence it is inherently insecure.
To read the main.js for further analysis or extracting the private key stored by Bambu in the app:
Use the MacOs .dmg file, not the exe. Finding the needed decryption code is easier in the .dmgExtract bambu-connect-beta-darwin-arm64-v1.0.4_4bb9cf0.dmg, in there you can find the files of the underlying Electron app in Bambu Connect (Beta).app/Contents/Resources folderThe app uses asarmor to prevent easy reading, the key is stored in ./app.asar.unpacked/.vite/build/main.node and can be extracted. Unpacking app.asar without fixing it first will result in an encrypted main.js file and 100 GB of decoy files generated, don't try it.Load main.node in Ghidra and Auto-Analyze it. Then search for the GetKey function, or press G and go to 0000b67eWrite down the hex key, for this build it's B0AE6995063C191D2B404637FBC193AE10DAB86A6BC1B1DE67B5AEE6E03018A2Install the npm package asarfix and use it to fix the archive: npx asarfix app.asar -k B0AE6995063C191D2B404637FBC193AE10DAB86A6BC1B1DE67B5AEE6E03018A2 -o fixed.asarNow you can extract it in cleartext with  npx asar extract fixed.asar src./src/.vite/build/main.js is minified, use any JavaScript beautifier to make it better readable.

Early on Monday morning, several buses carrying the detainees left the gates of Israel's Ofer prison, just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the release. The freed prisoners are said to be women and teenage boys from the West Bank and Jerusalem. They are the first of 1900 Palestinians Israel is set to release in exchange for 33 Israeli hostages in phase one of the deal.
Earlier, the first Israeli hostages were freed by Hamas militants as part of the deal.  Three women held captive for 471 days were finally brought back home to Israel - alive.  For other families, the wait continues. The six-week pause in fighting, which began on Sunday, will also allow hundreds of truckloads of aid per day to be brought in to the devastated territory.

The production-ready "Aptera Launch Edition" made its first appearance this month at CES 2025, and "also offers up to 400 miles (640 km) of range from a single charge via an electrical output, company representatives said in a statement." 


LiveScience describes the vehicle as "lighter and more energy-efficient than conventional EVs, while offering a 50% reduction in aerodynamic resistance," with an energy efficiency rating of 100 Watt-hours per mile (Wh/mile).
By contrast, a Tesla Model S (released in 2022) consumes 194 Wh/mile in the city in mild weather and 288 Wh/mile on the highway in mild weather, according to the EV Database. At a maximum range of 440 miles — including 40 miles using solar power and 400 miles using electricity — the Aptera EV may also overtake the current longest-range vehicles in production. The Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+ has a maximum range of 425 miles (684 km), according to the EV Database, followed by the Lucid Air Grand Touring at 410 miles (660 km). 
Aptera says it's raised $135 million "through equity crowdfunding" to fund its pre-production progress. "Since its launch, the Company has accepted $1.7 billion in pre-orders with nearly 50,000 vehicles reserved by future Aptera owners in the U.S. and internationally." 

 MotorTrend writes that "nearly two decades in the making, the otherworldly three-wheel Aptera is headed to production this year as a $40,000, 400-mile EV that can capture up to 40 miles worth of free solar energy every day. Maybe."

The California startup made similar promises in 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2022 and yet it has never delivered a single vehicle. Is anything different this time...? 

At CES, co-CEO (and one of Aptera's original founders) Chris Anthony told MotorTrend it will take another $60 million to finish the development work, buy the tooling, and build out the Carlsbad, California, assembly plant. "We're still in fundraising mode and we hope that we inspire some people in this beautiful building (Las Vegas Convention Center) to invest in Aptera," Anthony said. "We're trying to raise $20 million in the first quarter of this year. That will basically kick off all the long-lead items to get into production, but it's a $60 million plan to get into volume production." Anthony said the company has already made one of its largest purchases, the molds for the carbon-fiber sheet-molding composite body structure and the fiberglass sheet-molding composite body panels that will be made in Italy. The next $20 million will cover the tooling for the diecast metal suspension arms and the injection-molded interior components... 



It would be relatively easy for Aptera to hand build cars in a garage and announce the start of production, but the plan calls for building up to 80 cars per day per the guidance of engineering consultant and YouTuber Sandy Munro, who is an Aptera investor and adviser. "He really helped shepherd the design from what was an early prototype prove-out design into how to make the most manufacturable vehicle ever," Anthony said. The structure is built from just six parts and the entire car has been designed to be put together in a factory with just 12 stations. But that radical simplicity complicates the job at hand right now. In addition to developing the car, the small engineering team also has to create the machine that makes it. Anthony's plan has the factory ramping up to build 20,000 vehicles a year within nine months of starting production at the end of 2025. 
Before that can happen, Aptera needs to clear the same hurdle that tripped it up in 2011 and sent the company stumbling into liquidation — the money. "We would love one investor to be so inspired by what we're doing that they just hand us a $60 million check," Anthony told MotorTrend. "But it could be something that's kind of piecemeal over the next nine months to get that $60 million into the company."

rebuke, a senior Taliban figure has called on the group's leadership to end the ban on education for women and girls in Afghanistan.Afghan foreign ministry political deputy Sher Abbas Stanikzai made the remarks in a speech on Saturday in south-eastern Afghanistan's Khost province.He told an audience at a religious school ceremony there was no reason to deny education to women and girls, "just as there was no justification for it in the past and there shouldn't be one at all".The Taliban has banned women from higher education at institutions like Kabul University.Mr Stanikzai asserted the ongoing prohibition against female education had no religious justification."We are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a population of 40 million, depriving them of all their rights," Mr Stanikzai said in a video shared by his official account on social media."This is not in Islamic law, but our personal choice or nature." Comments dismissed as bid to 'rebrand' TalibanMr Stanikzai was once the head of the Taliban team in talks that led to the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan.It is not the first time he has said that women and girls deserve an education.He made similar remarks in September 2022, a year after schools closed for girls and months before the introduction of a university ban.Activists have warned that true progress can only come when there is the full restoration of women's rights in Afghanistan.()"We call on the leadership again to open the doors of education," he said, marking the first call for a change in policy and a direct appeal to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.However, Afghan women's rights advocates warned against viewing it as a turning point.Zubaida Akbar, an activist with the women's human rights organisation Femena, said the remarks were likely a strategic move to bolster credibility for the Taliban internationally."The Taliban deputy's remarks about there being no excuse for the education bans on Afghan women and girls reflects desperation," Ms Akbar told the ABC."They think making these statements is a strategic move to rebrand themselves as progressive."Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai is often criticised by his peers for advocating for women's rights.Crisis Group analyst Ibraheem Bahiss said Mr Stanikzai had periodically made statements deeming education to be the right of all Afghan women and girls."However, this latest statement seems to go further in the sense that he is publicly calling for a change in policy and questioned the legitimacy of the current approach," Mr Bahiss said.Susan Hutchinson, executive director of the NGO Azadi-e Zan (Free Woman), who has helped several women's rights defenders from Afghanistan, said Mr Stanikzai's comments alone are not enough to lead to a lift in the ban."Mr Stanikzai is one of the more progressive of the Taliban leaders and is often criticised by his peers for his stand on women's freedoms," Ms Hutchinson explained."The lack of educational access is a serious issue for the Afghan economy and overall welfare of the country," she added.Pressure on Taliban regime over denial of women's rightsNo country recognises the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, but countries like Russia have been building ties with them.India has also been developing relations with Afghan authorities.Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai has called on the international community to speak out against the Taliban's ban on women and girls' education.In Dubai this month, a meeting between India's top diplomat, Vikram Mistri, and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi showed their deepening cooperation.The United Nations has said that recognition of the Taliban government is almost impossible while bans on female education and employment remain in place and women can't go out in public without a male guardian.Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai this month told a conference hosted by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the Muslim World League that Islamic leaders should challenge the Taliban on women and girls' education.Ms Akbar highlighted the broader repression under the Taliban including banning women from work, singing or being heard in public."Access to education is not meaningful progress if women cannot freely move, speak, or participate in public life," Ms Akbar said.She called on the international community to remain vigilant against attempts to use partial reforms to win legitimacy. "The Taliban negotiator's statements appear to be a calculated effort to present an image of reform within their ranks."Some activists warn that the Taliban's statements may be a calculated effort to present an image of reform.()A statement on behalf of Ambassador Wahidullah Waissi of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Canberra to the ABC echoed these sentiments."Restoring girls' access to education — an essential and fundamental human right —requires more than superficial policy changes or public discourse; it demands a transformative shift in attitudes to undo the deep damage caused by their oppressive actions," said the statement.Since the Taliban's forced takeover in August 2021, the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Canberra has continued to fulfill its diplomatic responsibilities under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, operating independently of Taliban influence.The Taliban has increasing added restrictions on women since taking power. Last September, there were reports authorities had also stopped medical training and courses for women.In Afghanistan, women and girls can only be treated by female doctors and health professionals.Authorities have yet to confirm the medical training ban.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can someone tell me the big deal about

VPCs were invented and how they work. This is critical to understand because almost everything you do in AWS will happen inside of VPC. If you don't understand VPCs, it will be difficult to understand any of the other networking concepts.If you're reading this, maybe you have one of theseand you just found out that to put your app on AWS, you need all of this:And you have no idea what VPCs, subnets and so on are.This is the story of VPCs (Virtual Private Cloud)s, our first big topic. Many moons (and suns) ago, some AWS engineers were sitting in a room. They had a serious issue."Guys, lets talk business. Why aren't more companies moving to AWS?" they said."Maybe because all instances run in a single shared network, which means users can access each other's instances, and see each other's data," someone said."Maybe because it's hard for them to move their existing servers to AWS, because of IP address conflicts," someone else said."Wait… what are IP address conflicts?”Now we both have servers with the same IP address!Sidebar: You can find your local IP address using `ipconfig getifaddr en1` (works for Macs for wireless internet connections).Bam: IP address conflict. Every server in a network needs to have a unique IP address for the same reason that every house in a city needs to have a unique address. Otherwise, if someone has a package, they wouldn't know which house to deliver it to.This was a huge problem for AWS! I mean, see how serious these engineers look:This IP conflict issue meant people with on-prem servers had no easy way to gradually move to AWS. Think of all the potential customers they were losing! I'm giving you this background so you can understand why VPCs were invented. IP address conflicts weren't the only issue. In AWS, everyone's servers used to be on the same network, which meant if you were careless, it was easy for anyone to connect to your server and look at all kinds of sensitive data!For both these reasons, Amazon needed to give each customer their own private network, instead of having them all on the same shared network. And so VPCs were born.So there are two problems we're trying to solve:The fact that users can access each other's instances because they're in one big shared network.Maybe you're wondering, "why can't we just change the IP addresses so all machines have a unique IP address?" Well, in networking, you set up some things based around specific IP addresses (I'll get to exactly what stuff later), so that idea would require a lot of work in practice.Separate networks would also solve the security problem.By the way, why am I spending so long on VPCs? Isn't this post about putting one of theseBecause everything we will build happens in a VPC, so it's the starting point for things.Because a VPC is not something you can see, and I like to visualize my internet architecture. Other people visualize it in a way that's really confusing for me, and I want to make it less confusing for you.AWS docsAnd they'll draw an image that looks like this:But less pretty obviously – this is what theirs look like:Both of those are physical places. But what is the VPC? Is it a big tarp that sits on top of the data centers? Is it a dark fog? Is it a general feeling of unease that blankets the region, as all the data centers play Radiohead's "Fitter, Happier" on repeat?We've talked about why AWS needed VPCs, and the idea behind VPCs, but how are they implemented? How do they actually work?Your instances in AWS always run inside a VPC. But in real life, of course, your instances are just running on servers in AWS datacenters.Suppose I have an instance A on server 1, and I want to talk to another instance B on server 2.The mapping service is what ensures that we can never connect to each other's instances. Through the mapping service, all my instances are connected together, and they can have any IP address I want, because it's like they're namespaced to me. The mapping service is what creates the private network inside AWS for me.So when you think VPC, picture a service that connects all these instances together.Going back to this image, we can now understand what it means:That VPC box just means the scope of the mapping service. A mapping service can connect EC2 instances that are on servers in different availability zones, which is why the VPC is overlaid over the two availability zones. But the mapping service can't connect instances in different regions, so the VPC doesn't span regions.So we find out that they don't play "Fitter, Happier" in the data centers after all. Maybe it's just a recording of Jeff Bezos singing "Money" by Pink Floyd.Throughout this guide, I'll show you how to create AWS resources using Terraform. I find Terraform easier to follow than point-and-click on the AWS console, because you can just copy the code and run it.Here's the Terraform code to create a VPC:resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
}The full code listing is hereIn AWS, every customer has their own private network called the VPC.Without private networks, we run into IP address collisions.Without private networks, everyone is on the same network, which is really bad for security.VPCs are implemented using the mapping service.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will TikTok keep running in the US? #trump #bloomberg #socialmedia</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSQCXErwYZk</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:51:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TikTok restored service to its app in the US on Sunday with some help from President-elect Donald Trump, who's pledged to extend a deadline to sell the company once he takes office.

 Grand Theft Hamlet won SXSW's Jury Award for best documentary, and has now opened in U.S. theatres this weekend (and begun streaming on Mubi), after opening in the U.K. and Ireland. But nearly the entire film is set in Grand Theft Auto's crime-infested version of Los Angeles, the Times reports, "where even the good guys have weapons and a nihilistic streak — the vengeful Prince of Denmark fits right in."
Yet when Sam Crane, a.k.a. @Hamlet_thedane, launches into one of the Bard's monologues, he's often murdered by a fellow player within minutes. Everyone's a critic. 

Crane co-directed the movie with his wife, Pinny Grylls, a first-time gamer who functions as the film's camera of sorts. What her character sees, where she chooses to stand and look, makes up much of the film, although the editing team does phenomenal work splicing in other characters' points of view. (We're never outside of the game until the last 30 seconds; only then do we see anyone's real face....) The Bard's story is only half the point. Really, this is a classic let's-put-on-a-pixilated-show tale about the need to create beauty in the world — even this violent world — especially when stage productions in England have shuttered, forcing Crane, a husband and father, and Mark Oosterveen, single and lonely, to kill time speeding around the digital desert... 


To our surprise (and theirs), the play's tussles with depression and anguish and inertia become increasingly resonant as the production and the pandemic limps toward their conclusions. When Crane and Oosterveen's "Grand Theft Auto" avatars hop into a van with an anonymous gamer and ask this online stranger for his thoughts on Hamlet's suicidal soliloquy, the man, a real-life delivery driver stuck at home with a broken leg, admits, "I don't think I'm in the right place to be replying to this right now...." 
In 2014 Hamlet was also staged in Guild Wars 2, the article points out. "This is, however, the first attempt I'm aware of that attempts to do the whole thing live in one go, no matter if one of the virtual actors falls to their doom from a blimp. 

"As Grylls says, 'You can't stop production just because somebody dies.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Israeli hostages freed as Gaza ceasefire begins | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MaiQImmpNY</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:03:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Video released by the Israeli government showed tearful scenes inside a hospital where three women — Emily Damari, Doron Steinbrecher and Romi Gonen — held captive in Gaza for 15 months were finally reunited with family members.

Yet post-graduation, their trajectory is an economic tragedy - and a hidden arbitrage opportunity.Top London hardware engineer graduates: £30,000-£50,000Silicon Valley equivalent: $150,000+The reality for most graduates is even grimmer:£25,000 starting salaries at traditional engineering firmsExodus to consulting or finance just because it's compensated betterMeanwhile computer science graduates land lucrative jobs in big tech or quant trading, often starting at £100,000+Examples of wasted potential:Sarah: Built a fusion reactor at 16. Now? Debugging fintech payment systems.James: 3D-printed prosthetic limbs for A-levels. Today? Writing credit risk reports.Alex: Developed AI drone swarms for disaster relief at 18. Graduated with top honours from Imperial. His job? Tweaking a single button's ergonomics on home appliances.These aren't outliers. They're a generation of engineering prodigies whose talents are being squandered.This isn't just wage disparity. It's misallocation of human capital on a national scale.As a hardware founder in London, I've witnessed this firsthand. We have the talent for groundbreaking innovation, but lack the means to realise it.: Unlike lucrative software jobs, hardware engineering demands physical presence.European VCs, mostly bullish on fintech and SaaS, remain wary of hardware. Result? A feedback loop of underinvestment and missed opportunities. Traditional engineering firms fail to innovate in talent strategies and match compensation, accelerating brain drain. We're not just losing salary differences; we're missing out on the next ARM or Tesla. One successful hardware company can spawn dozens of ancillary businesses. We're losing these compounding effects.National Security Implications: In an era where technological edge equals geopolitical power, can we afford to let our best hardware talent languish?Brain Drain Acceleration: We risk losing our top talent permanently to overseas markets."London's lower living costs justify lower salaries."False. London is around the same as NYC and more expensive than most parts of California and definitely Texas. This also ignores:Wealth Creation and Ecosystem Acceleration: High salaries and successful exits compound dramatically over time, that's why the US has so much more VC and angel capital.Talent attraction: Top jobs draw global talent. Example: Google's entry into London with competitive salaries reshaped the entire tech ecosystem."UK's small market limits growth."Outdated thinking. Consider:Dyson: From a Wiltshire barn to a global technology powerhouse, now innovating in Singapore and Malaysia.Ocado: Online grocer turned global automation technology provider, with robotics solutions deployed across Europe and North America.ARM: Powering 95% of smartphones globally."Hardware is riskier than software."Development speed: 3D prints and PCB prototypes now available in 24 hours, rivalling software iteration speeds.Moat strength: Apple's hardware-software ecosystem is far more defensible than most pure software plays.ARM: Sold to SoftBank for $32B in 2016, now worth $140B+.CSR (Cambridge Silicon Radio): Acquired by Qualcomm for $2.5B in 2015.Dyson: While not an exit, it's valued at over £20B as of 2023.It isn't about costs. It's about ambition.While software talent flows freely globally, ambitious UK hardware startups can exclusively tap into a world-class, locally-bound talent pool.The Software Brain Drain:US tech giants easily poach UK software talentRemote work erases geographical boundariesResult: Constant outflow of top software engineersThe Hardware Opportunity:Physical presence matters - can't build rockets remotelyUK hardware talent largely untapped by global competitionBuild something ambitious, attract local engineering superstarsBrilliant minds wasting away in soul-crushing corporate jobsYour future "10x engineer" is someone else's bored employeeForget software. Hardware is the new frontier.Build the next ARM or Dyson, not another fintech appLeverage UK's world-class research institutionsIncumbents are unambitious, startups are few (for now)Top-tier VCs awakening to UK hardware potentialFirst movers will have pick of the talent poolThis arbitrage won't last forever. As you read this, others are waking up to the opportunity. The first movers will reap the rewards. The followers will wonder why they didn't see it sooner.The Hardware Revolution Starts NowWake up, UK. Our engineering talent is our nuclear fusion. Ignite it or lose the future.Your next unicorn isn't code. It's cobalt and circuits. Back the tangible.Stop fleeing to the US. London can be the hardware capital of the world. We have the talent. We have the creativity. What we need is your audacity.Your brain's worth billions. Build empires, not apps.While the world obsesses over the next GPT wrapper, we'll forge the next industrial revolution.This isn't a pipe dream. It's an imperative.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Three hostages arrive in Israel from Gaza as fragile ceasefire passes first hurdle</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgn6xv0ZgsI</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 23:32:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The first three hostages released from Gaza have arrived in Israel on Sunday, hours after the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took hold. The truce, which started at 11:15 a.m. local time, is the first step toward ultimately ending the conflict and returning hostages abducted in Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack. The ceasefire ushers in an initial six weeks of calm and raises hopes for the release of nearly 100 remaining hostages and an end to the devastating war. Read more here: https://bit.ly/4apahi4

Now, it feels like the most successful tech companies are making it worse.Internet surveillance, the algorithmic polarization of social media, predatory app stores, and extractive business models have eroded the freedoms the personal computer once promised, effectively ending the PC era for most tech consumers.The “personal computer” was once a radical idea—a computer an individual could own and control completely. The concept emerged in the early 1970s when microprocessors made it economical and practical for a person to own their very own computer, in contrast to the rise of data processing mainframes in the 1950s and 60s.At its core, the PC movement was about a kind of tech liberty—–which I’ll define as the freedom to explore new ideas, control your own creative works, and make mistakes without punishment.The personal computer era bloomed in the late 1970s and continued into the 1980s and 90s. But over the past decade in particular, the Internet and digital rights management (DRM) have been steadily pulling that control away from us and putting it into the hands of huge corporations. We need to take back control of our digital lives and make computing personal again.Don’t get me wrong: I’m not calling the tech industry evil. I’m a huge fan of technology. The industry is full of great people, and this is not a personal attack on anyone. I just think runaway market forces and a handful of poorly-crafted US laws like section 1201 of the DMCA have put all of us onto the wrong track (more on that below).To some extent, tech companies were always predatory. To some extent, all companies are predatory. It’s a matter of degrees. But I believe there’s a fundamental truth that we’ve charted a deeply unhealthy path ahead with consumer technology at the moment.Tech critic Ed Zitron calls this phenomenon “The Rot Economy,” where companies are more obsessed with continuous growth than with providing useful products. “Our economy isn’t one that produces things to be used, but things that increase usage,” Zitron wrote in another piece, bringing focus to ideas I’ve been mulling for the past half-decade.This post started as a 2022 Twitter thread, and I’ve offered to write editorials about my frustrations with increasingly predatory tech business practices since 2020 for my last two employers, but both declined to publish them. I understand why. These are uncomfortable truths to face. But if you love technology like I do, we have to accept what we’re doing wrong if we are going to make it better.While consumer and computer tech today is more powerful than ever before—and in some ways far more convenient—some of the structural ways we used to interface with technology companies were arguably healthier in the past.Further, what percentage of your income had to go towards annual software subscriptions on a 20th century Windows PC (like this Sony VAIO)? You bought an application and you owned an indefinite license to use it. If there was an upgrade, you bought that too. And if you liked an older version of the software, you could keep using it without having it vanish in an automatic update.How many Nintendo Entertainment System games sustained themselves with in-app purchases and microtransactions? What more did the console ask of you after you bought a cartridge? Maybe to buy another one later if it was fun?Which part of this Motorola StarTAC cellular phone kept track of your every move and sold the information, behind your back, to private data brokers? And which part included sealed-in batteries that would ruin the entire phone if they went bad?Which part of Google in the 1990s and early 2000s blanketed its results with deceptive ads or made you add “Reddit” to every search to get good results that weren’t overwhelmed by SEO-seeking filler content?Which part of this VHS tape disappeared or became unplayable if the publisher suddenly decided it didn’t like it anymore—or didn’t want to pay the writers and actors residual fees?Americans have allowed runaway business models, empowered by tech, to subvert privacy and individual liberty on the road to making money. Our default tech business model has become extractive, like part of a strip-mining operation. Consumers—and now creative works (used for training AI)—are treated as a natural resource to be milked and exploited.The extractive model may end up being self-destructive for the tech industry itself. In the physical world, resource extraction needs limits and regulations to be sustainable. It can be wildly profitable until a resource becomes over-harvested, or the harvesting process corrupts the environment that lets the industry exist in the first place.There’s also the drive to lock consumers into an ecosystem, powered by DRM. You should buy tech products and get direct value fairly, not unleash a secret vampire to track you, manipulate you, and attempt to extract money from you forever. Just because companies have unlocked this “everything as a service” endless money hack does not mean they should do it.And there’s another problem. Very soon, we might be threatening the continuity of history itself with technologies that pollute the historical record with AI-generated noise. It sounds dramatic, but that could eventually undermine the shared cultural bonds that hold cultural groups together.That’s important because history is what makes this type of criticism possible. History is how we know if we’re being abused because we can rely on written records of people who came before (even 15 minutes ago) and make comparisons. If technology takes history away from us, there may be no hope of recovery.How We Can Reclaim ControlEvery generation looks back and says, “Things used to be better,” whether they are accurate or not.But I’m not suggesting we live in the past. It is possible to learn from history and integrate the best of today’s technology with fair business practices that are more sustainable and healthy for everyone in the long run.In the short term, we can do things like support open projects like Linux, support non-predatory and open source software, and run apps and store data locally as much as possible. But some bigger structural changes are necessary if we really want to launch the era of Personal Computer 2.0.I’ve shown this editorial to friends, and some people felt that I did not emphasize the benefits of current technology enough. But I argue that my criticism is less about the actual technology and more about how we use it—and how companies make money from it.Since I originally wrote my thoughts in a viral Twitter thread in June 2022, others have expanded on these ideas with far more eloquence. Five months after my thread, Cory Doctorow wrote his first post on “enshittification,” a hallmark piece identifying a tendency for online platforms to decay over time.A common thread between many of the issues hinted at above and in both Doctorow and Zitron’s work has been the rise of the ubiquitous Internet, which has allowed content owners and device makers to keep an eye on (and influence) consumer habits remotely, pulling our strings like puppeteers and putting a drip feed on our wallets.Additionally, section 1201 of the DMCA made it illegal to circumvent DRM, allowing manufacturers to lock down platforms in a way that challenges the traditional concept of ownership, enables predatory app stores, and threatens our cultural history.Tech monopolies must be held to account, the outsized influence of some tech billionaires must be held in check, and competition must be allowed to thrive. We may also need to consider the protection of both consumers themselves and human-created works (including our history) as part of a conservation effort before extractive models permanently pollute our shared cultural resources.The way the political winds are blowing right now in the US, significant legal reform seems unlikely for now. Things may need to get much worse before they get better. But the kind of extractive lock-in we’re seeing with technology is fundamentally incompatible with freedom in my opinion, so something needs to change if we still value the kind of personal liberty the PC once promised—that freedom to explore, create, and make mistakes without surveillance or punishment.Sure, things will never be perfect in the United States. Profits will always be chased, and there will be collateral damage. And yes, some parts of technology today are better than ever (computing power, screen resolutions, and bandwidth to name a few).The Internet has brought amazing things, including Wikipedia, The Internet Archive, multiplayer online gaming, , and work-from-home jobs. But the urge to exploit users to the maximum extent through digital locks and surveillance should be held in check so that we can earnestly and honestly make the tech industry a beacon of optimism once more.The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1970s. There is no “logging off,” nearly everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, and the digital world increasingly overlaps with every aspect of our lives. That means digital freedom is now equivalent to actual legal and personal freedom, and we must be allowed to control our own destinies.Whether through purposeful reform or the eventual collapse of digital strip mining, I believe the personal computer will eventually rise again—–along with our chance to reclaim control of our digital lives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>In AI Arms Race, America Needs Private Companies, Warns National Security Advisor</title><link>https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/01/19/1955244/in-ai-arms-race-america-needs-private-companies-warns-national-security-advisor?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 23:06:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[America's outgoing national security adviser has "wide access to the world's secrets," writes Axios, adding that the security adviser delivered a "chilling" warning that "The next few years will determine whether AI leads to catastrophe — and whether China or America prevails in the AI arms race." 

But in addition, Sullivan "said in our phone interview that unlike previous dramatic technology advancements (atomic weapons, space, the internet), AI development sits outside of government and security clearances, and in the hands of private companies with the power of nation-states... 'There's going to have to be a new model of relationship because of just the sheer capability in the hands of a private actor,' Sullivan says..."

 Somehow, government will have to join forces with these companies to nurture and protect America's early AI edge, and shape the global rules for using potentially God-like powers, he says. U.S. failure to get this right, Sullivan warns, could be "dramatic, and dramatically negative — to include the democratization of extremely powerful and lethal weapons; massive disruption and dislocation of jobs; an avalanche of misinformation..." 

To distill Sullivan: America must quickly perfect a technology that many believe will be smarter and more capable than humans. We need to do this without decimating U.S. jobs, and inadvertently unleashing something with capabilities we didn't anticipate or prepare for. We need to both beat China on the technology and in shaping and setting global usage and monitoring of it, so bad actors don't use it catastrophically. Oh, and it can only be done with unprecedented government-private sector collaboration — and probably difficult, but vital, cooperation with China... 

There's no person we know in a position of power in AI or governance who doesn't share Sullivan's broad belief in the stakes ahead... 
That said, AI is like the climate: America could do everything right — but if China refuses to do the same, the problem persists and metastasizes fast. Sullivan said Trump, like Biden, should try to work with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on a global AI framework, much like the world did with nuclear weapons. 

"I personally am not an AI doomer," Sullivan says in the interview. "I am a person who believes that we can seize the opportunities of AI. But to do so, we've got to manage the downside risks, and we have to be clear-eyed and real about those risks."

I will explain a little bit about the docker container networking in this blog post.\
I followed the steps mentioned in this to install docker on Ubuntu.\
Post docker install, you can see the  device in the listip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    link/ether 02:42:cf:b4:c1:a8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
\
Let’s create a busybox container.docker run --name bb -dt busybox
 docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED              STATUS              PORTS    NAMES
02429964e449   busybox   "sh"      About a minute ago   Up About a minute             bb
\
In the device list, you see the  interface is created with the master as docker0.ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    link/ether 02:fd:4d:34:55:76 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
11: docker0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default

    link/ether e2:15:50:88:11:03 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 2
\
Let’s check the network namespace.\
And you won’t see any network namespaces…How come??? This is because:ip netns list command looks up network namespaces file in the 
/var/run/netns directory.

However, the Docker daemon doesn’t create a reference of
the network namespace file in the /var/run/netns directory
after the creation. Therefore, ip netns ls cannot resolve the
network namespace file

Ref: https://www.baeldung.com/linux/docker-network-namespace-invisible
\
If you want  to show the namespace name docker has created, then follow the below stepsexport container_name=bb
container_pid=$(sudo docker inspect -f '' $container_name)
echo $container_pid

sudo touch /var/run/netns/$container_name
sudo mount -o bind /proc/$container_pid/ns/net /var/run/netns/$container_name
\
Now, you can see the namespace name.sudo ip netns exec bb ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
\
The following diagram will help you visualize it better.With this, I’m signing off. I hope this blog series helps to de-clutter your container networking.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Accidents, Not Sabotage, Likely Damaged Baltic Undersea Cables, Say US and European Intelligence Officials</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/19/225237/accidents-not-sabotage-likely-damaged-baltic-undersea-cables-say-us-and-european-intelligence-officials?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 22:08:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Washington Post reports:
Ruptures of undersea cables that have rattled European security officials in recent months were likely the result of maritime accidents rather than Russian sabotage, according to several U.S. and European intelligence officials. 

The determination reflects an emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services, according to senior officials from three countries involved in ongoing investigations of a string of incidents in which critical seabed energy and communications lines have been severed... [S]o far, officials said, investigations involving the United States and a half-dozen European security services have turned up no indication that commercial ships suspected of dragging anchors across seabed systems did so intentionally or at the direction of Moscow. Instead, U.S. and European officials said that the evidence gathered to date — including intercepted communications and other classified intelligence — points to accidents caused by inexperienced crews serving aboard poorly maintained vessels. 

U.S. officials cited "clear explanations" that have come to light in each case indicating a likelihood that the damage was accidental, and a lack of evidence suggesting Russian culpability. Officials with two European intelligence services said that they concurred with U.S. assessments. Despite initial suspicions that Russia was involved, one European official said there is "counter evidence" suggesting otherwise. The U.S. and European officials declined to elaborate and spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of ongoing investigations... 


A Nordic official briefed on the investigation said conditions on the tanker were abysmal. "We've always gone out with the assumption that shadow fleet vessels are in bad shape," the official said. "But this was even worse than we thought...." European security officials said that Finland's main intelligence service is in agreement with Western counterparts that the Dec. 25 incident appears to have been an accident, though they cautioned that it may be impossible to rule out a Russian role. 
The article points out another reason Russia might not want to draw attention to the waterways around NATO countries. Doing so "could endanger oil smuggling operations Russia has relied on to finance the war in Ukraine, and possibly provoke more aggressive efforts by Western governments to choke off Russia's route to the North Atlantic."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>France&apos;s answer to recent Russian behavior, Sent VADOR Airborne &apos;&apos;designation&apos;&apos;, observation and reconnaissance tactical plane vector around Kaliningrad.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1i59mf8/frances_answer_to_recent_russian_behavior_sent/</link><author>/u/UpgradedSiera6666</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 21:29:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What&apos;s known about the first 90 Palestinian prisoners to be released? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phpL8Me21mI</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 21:15:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ninety Palestinian prisoners are due to be released in exchange for the three Israeli hostages handed over by Hamas.

Sheep.


In Milam County, outside Austin [Texas], SB Energy operates the fifth-largest solar project in the country, capable of generating 900 megawatts of power across 4,000 acres (1,618 hectares). How do they manage all that grass? With the help of about 3,000 sheep, which are better suited than lawnmowers to fit between small crevices and chew away rain or shine. The proliferation of sheep on solar farms is part of a broader trend — solar grazing — that has exploded alongside the solar industry. Agrivoltaics, a method using land for both solar energy production and agriculture, is on the rise with more than 60 solar grazing projects in the U.S., according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. 

The American Solar Grazing Association says 27 states engage in the practice. "The industry tends to rely on gas-powered mowers, which kind of contradicts the purpose of renewables," SB Energy asset manager James Hawkins said... Because solar fields use sunny, flat land that is often ideal for livestock grazing, the power plants have been used in coordination with farmers rather than against them.... 

Some agriculture experts say [solar sheepherders'] success reflects how solar farms have become a boon for some ranchers. Reid Redden, a sheep farmer and solar vegetation manager in San Angelo, Texas, said a successful sheep business requires agricultural land that has become increasingly scarce. "Solar grazing is probably the biggest opportunity that the sheep industry had in the United States in several generations," Redden said. The response to solar grazing has been overwhelmingly positive in rural communities near South Texas solar farms where Redden raises sheep for sites to use, he said. "I think it softens the blow of the big shock and awe of a big solar farm coming in," Redden said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Suicide Hotlines Promised Anonymity - So Why Was Sensitive Data Sent to Facebook?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/suicide-hotlines-promised-anonymity-so-why-was-sensitive-data-sent-to-facebook?source=rss</link><author>The Markup</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 21:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Websites for mental health crisis resources across the country—which promise anonymity for visitors, many of whom are at a desperate moment in their lives—have been quietly sending sensitive visitor data to Facebook, The Markup has found.\
Dozens of websites tied to the national mental health crisis 988 hotline, which launched last summer, transmit the data through a tool called the Meta Pixel, according to testing conducted by The Markup. That data often included signals to Facebook when visitors attempted to dial for mental health emergencies by tapping on dedicated call buttons on the websites.\
In some cases, filling out contact forms on the sites transmitted hashed but easily unscrambled names and email addresses to Facebook.The Markup tested 186 local crisis center websites under the umbrella of the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Calls to the national 988 line are routed to these centers based on the area code of the caller. The organizations often also operate their own crisis lines and provide other social services to their communities.\
The Markup’s testing revealed that more than 30 crisis center websites employed the Meta Pixel, formerly called the Facebook Pixel. The pixel, a short snippet of code included on a webpage that enables advertising on Facebook, is a free and widely used tool. A 2020 Markup investigation found that 30 percent of the web’s most popular sites use it.\
The pixels The Markup found tracked visitor behavior to different degrees. All of the sites recorded that a visitor had viewed the homepage, while others captured more potentially sensitive information.\
Many of the sites included buttons that allowed users to directly call either 988 or a local line for mental health help. But clicking on those buttons often triggered a signal to be sent to Facebook that shared information about what a visitor clicked on. A pixel on one site sent data to Facebook on visitors who clicked a button labeled “24-Hour Crisis Line” that called local crisis services.\
Clicking a button or filling out a form also sometimes sent personally identifiable data, such as names or unique ID numbers, to Facebook.The website for the Volunteers of America Western Washington is a good example. The social services nonprofit says it responds to more than 300,000 requests for assistance each year. When a web user visited the organization’s website, a pixel on the homepage noted the visit.If the visitor then tried to call the national 988 crisis hotline through the website by clicking on a button labeled “call or text 988,” that click—including the text on the button—was sent to Facebook. The click also transmitted an “external ID,” a code that Facebook uses to attempt to match web users to their Facebook accounts.\
If a visitor filled out a contact form on the Volunteers of America Western Washington’s homepage, even more private information was transmitted to Facebook. After filling out and sending the form, a pixel transmitted hashed, or scrambled, versions of the person’s first and last name, as well as email address.\
After publication, Maca Ferguson, a spokesperson for Volunteers of America Western Washington, said the pixel was used for fundraising efforts and “not intended to collect personally identifiable information for purposes of tracking or transmitting this data back to Meta, its subsidiaries, or any third party for any reason” and that any data was sent “without our knowledge or consent.” Ferguson told The Markup the organization has since removed the pixel.\
The Markup found similar activity on other sites.\
The Contra Costa Crisis Center, an organization providing social services in Northern California, noted to Facebook when a user clicked on a button to call or text for crisis services. About 3,000 miles away, in Rhode Island, an organization called BH Link used a pixel that also pinged Facebook when a visitor clicked a button to call crisis services from its homepage. (After publication of this article Contra Costa Crisis Center told The Markup that it had removed the pixel.)\
Facebook can use data collected by the pixel to link website visitors to their Facebook accounts, but the data is collected whether or not the visitor has a Facebook account. Although the names and email addresses sent to Facebook were hashed, they can be easily unscrambled with free and widely available web services.\
After The Markup contacted the 33 crisis centers about their practices, some said they were unaware that the code was on their sites and that they’d take steps to remove it.\
“This was not intentional and thank you for making us aware of the potential issue,” Leo Pellerin, chief information officer for the United Way of Connecticut, a partner in the national 988 network, said in an emailed statement. Pellerin said they had removed the code, which they attributed to a plug-in on their website.\
Lee Flinn, director of the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline, said in an email that she had “never heard of Meta Pixel” and was asking the outside vendor who had worked on the organization’s site to remove the code. “We value the privacy of individuals who reach out to us, and any tracking devices are not intentional on our part, nor did we ask any developer to install,” she said. “Anything regarding tracking that is found will be immediately removed.”\
Ken Gibson, a spokesperson for the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay, said the organization had recently placed the pixel on its site to advertise for staff but would now reduce the information the pixel gathers to only careers pages on the site.\
In follow-up tests, four organizations appeared to have completely removed the code. The majority of the centers we contacted did not respond to requests for comment.\
“Advertisers should not send sensitive information about people through our Business Tools,” Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez told The Markup in an emailed statement that mirrored those the company has previously provided in response to reporting on the Meta Pixel. “Doing so is against our policies and we educate advertisers on properly setting up Business tools to prevent this from occurring. Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.”\
Vazquez did not respond to a question about whether or how Meta could determine if this specific data was filtered.\
There is no evidence that either Facebook or any of the crisis centers themselves attempted to identify visitors or callers, or that an actual human ever identified someone who attempted to call for help through a website. Some organizations explicitly said in response to The Markup’s requests for comment that they valued the anonymity promised by the 988 line.\
Mary Claire Givelber, executive director of New Jersey–based Caring Contact, said in an email that the organization had briefly used the pixel to recruit volunteers on Facebook but would now remove it.\
“For the avoidance of all doubt, Caring Contact has not used the Meta Pixel to identify, target, or advertise to any potential or actual callers or texters of the Caring Contact crisis hotline,” Givelber said.\
Meta can use information gathered from its tools for its own purposes, however, and data sent to the company through the pixels scattered across the web enters a black box that can catalog and organize data with little oversight.\
Divendra Jaffar, a spokesperson for Vibrant Emotional Health, the nonprofit responsible for administering the national 988 crisis line, pointed out in an emailed statement that data transmitted through the pixel is encrypted.\
“While Vibrant Emotional Health does not require our 988 Lifeline network of crisis centers to provide updates on their marketing and advertising practices, we do provide best practices guidelines to our centers, counselors, and staff and hold them to rigorous operating standards, which are reviewed and approved by our government partners,” Jaffar said.\
The organization did not respond to a request to provide any relevant best practices.\
Jen King, the privacy and data policy fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said in an interview that, regardless of the reasons, Meta is gathering far too much data through its tools.\
“Even if this is accidental still on the part of the developers, you shouldn’t still be able to fall into this trap,” she said. “The time has long passed when you can use that excuse.”The Pixel and Sensitive DataMeta, Facebook’s parent company, offers the pixel as a way to track visitors on the web and to more precisely target ads to those visitors on Facebook. For businesses and other organizations, it’s a valuable tool: A small company can advertise on Facebook directly to people who purchased a certain product, for example, or a nonprofit could follow up on Facebook with users who donated on their last visit to a website.\
One organization, the Minnesota-based Greater Twin Cities United Way, said it did not use its website to reach out to potential 988 callers but instead focused on “donors and other organizational stakeholders.” Sam Daub, integrated marketing manager of the organization, said in an emailed statement that the organization uses tools like the pixel “to facilitate conversion-tracking and content retargeting toward users who visit our website” to reach those people but did not track specific activity of 988 callers.\
Apart from encouraging users to buy ads, this sort of data is also potentially valuable to Meta, which, in accordance with its terms of service, can use the information to power its algorithms. The company reserves the right to use data transmitted through the pixel to, for instance, “personalize the features and content (including ads and recommendations) that we show people on and off our Meta Products.” (This is one of the reasons an online shopper might look at a pair of pants online and suddenly see the same pair follow them in advertisements across social media.)\
The pixel has proved massively popular. The company told Congress in 2018 that there were more than two million pixels collecting data across the web, a number that has likely increased in the time since. There is no federal privacy legislation in the United States that regulates how most of that data can be used.\
Meta’s policies prohibit organizations from sending sensitive information through the pixel on children under 13, or generally any data related to sensitive financial or health matters. The company says it has an automated system “designed to filter out potentially sensitive data that it detects” but that it is advertisers’ responsibility to “ensure that their integrations do not send sensitive information to Meta.”\
The types of sensitive health information Meta specifically prohibits being sent include information on “mental health and psychological states” as well as “physical locations that identify a health condition, or places of treatment/counseling.” Vazquez did not directly respond to a question about whether the data sent from the crisis centers violated Meta’s policies.\
There is evidence that even Meta itself can’t always say where that data ends up. In a leaked document obtained and published by Vice’s Motherboard, company engineers said they did not “have an adequate level of control and explainability over how our systems use data.” The document compared user data to a bottle of ink spilled into a body of water that then becomes unrecoverable. \
A Facebook spokesperson responded to the report at the time, saying it left out a number of the company’s “extensive processes and controls to comply with privacy regulations,” though the spokesperson did not give any specifics. “It’s simply inaccurate to conclude that it demonstrates non-compliance,” the spokesperson said.\
“The original use cases [for the pixel] perhaps weren’t quite so invasive, or people weren’t using it so widely,” King said but added that, at this point, Meta is “clearly grabbing way too much data.”988 History and ControversyThe national 988 crisis line is the result of a years-long effort by the Federal Communications Commission to provide a simple, easy-to-remember, three-digit number for people experiencing a mental health crisis.\
But the launch of 988 has been accompanied by questions about privacy and anonymity, mostly around how or whether callers to the line can ever be tracked by emergency services. The national line is advertised as an anonymous service, but in the past callers have said they’ve been tracked without their consent when calling crisis lines. Police have sometimes responded directly in those incidents, leading to harrowing incidents.\
The current 988 line doesn’t track users through geolocation technology, according to the service, although counselors are required to provide information to emergency services like 911 in certain situations. That requirement has been the source of controversy, and groups like the Trans Lifeline, a nonprofit crisis hotline serving the trans community, stepped away from the network.\
The organization has launched a campaign to bring the issue more prominence. Yana Calou, the director of advocacy at Trans Lifeline, told The Markup in an interview that there are some lines that “really explicitly don’t” track, and the campaign is meant to direct people to those lines instead. (Trans Lifeline, which is not involved in the national 988 network, also uses the Meta Pixel on its site. After being alerted by The Markup, a Trans Lifeline spokesperson, Nemu HJ, said they would remove the code from the site.)\
Data-sharing practices have landed other service providers in controversy as well. Last year, Politico reported that the nonprofit Crisis Text Line, a popular mental health service, was partnering with a for-profit spinoff that used data gleaned from text conversations to market customer-service software. The organization quickly ended the partnership after it was publicly revealed.\
Having a space where there’s a sense of trust between a caller and an organization can make all the difference in an intervention, Calou said. “Actually being able to have people tell us the truth about what’s going on lets people feel like they can get support,” they said.This story has been updated to include a Facebook response last year to the linked Motherboard article.Updates: June 13, 2023; June 20, 2023This story was updated on June 13 to note that Contra Costa Crisis Center removed the pixel from its site after publication. It was updated on June 20 to add a comment from Volunteers of American Western Washington received after publication noting that that organization has since removed the pixel from its site.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From recruiting for Palantir to landing a plane on Highway 85: meet defense tech’s wildest power broker</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/from-recruiting-for-palantir-to-landing-on-highway-85-meet-defense-techs-wildest-power-broker/</link><author>Margaux MacColl</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Peter Conway has recruited for some of the buzziest defense and hard tech firms in Silicon Valley over the last decade, like Palantir and Mach Industries.© 2024 TechCrunch.

later Flask), the most
important part of the developer experience for me was enabling fast, automatic
reloading.  Werkzeug (and with it Flask), this is achieved by using two
procsses at all times.  The parent process holds on to the file descriptor
of the socket on which the server listens, and a subprocess picks up that
file descriptor.  That subprocess restarts when it detects changes.  This
ensures that no matter what happens, there is no window where the browser
reports a connection error.  At worst, the browser will hang until the
process finishes reloading, after which the page loads successfully.  In
case the inner process fails to come up during restarts, you get an error
message.A few years ago, I wanted to accomplish the same experience for working
with Rust code which is why I wrote systemfd and listenfd.  I however realized that I
never really wrote here about how they work and disappointingly I think
those crates, and a good auto-reloading experience in Rust are largely
unknown.Firstly one needs to monitor the file system for changes.  While in theory
I could have done this myself, there was already a tool that could do
that.At the time there was cargo watch.  Today one might instead use it
together with the more generic watchexec.  Either one monitor your
workspace for changes and then executes a command.  So you can for
instance tell it to restart your program.  One of these will work:watchexec -r -- cargo run
cargo watch -x run
You will need a tool like that to do the watching part.  At this point I
recommend the more generic  which you can find on homebrew and
elsewhere.But what about the socket?  The solution to this problem I picked comes
from systemd.  Systemd has a
“protocol” that standardizes passing file descriptors from one process to
another through environment variables.  In systemd parlance this is called
“socket activation,” as it allows systemd to only launch a program if
someone started making a request to the socket.  This concept was
originally introduced by Apple as part of launchd.To make this work with Rust, I created two crates:systemfd is the command
line tool that opens sockets and passes them on to other programs.listenfd is a Rust crate that
accepts file descriptors from systemd or .It's worth noting that systemfd is not exclusivly useful to Rust.  The
systemd protocol can be implemented in other languages as well, meaning
that if you have a socket server written in Go or Python, you can also use
systemfd.So here is how you use it.First you need to add  to your project:Then, modify your server code to accept sockets via listenfd before
falling back to listening itself on ports provided through command-line
arguments or configuration files.  Here is an example using  in
axum:::::::::-> -> ::::::::::::::::The key point here is to accept socket 0 from the environment as a TCP
listener and use it if available.  If the socket is not provided (e.g.
when launched without systemd/), the code falls back to opening a
fixed port.Finally you can use  /  together with :systemfd --no-pid -s http::8888 -- watchexec -r -- cargo run
systemfd --no-pid -s http::8888 -- cargo watch -x run
This is what the parameters mean: needs to be first it's the program that opens the sockets. is a flag prevents the PID from being passed.  This is necessary
for  to accept the socket.  This is a departure of the socket
passing protocol from systemd which otherwise does not allow ports to be
passed through another program (like ).  In short: when the
PID information is not passed, then listenfd will accept the socket
regardless.  Otherwise it would only accept it from the direct parent
process. tells  to open one TCP socket on port 8888.
Using  instead of  is a small improvement that will cause
systemfd to print out a URL on startup. makes  restart the process when something
changes in the current working directory. is the program that watchexec will start and re-start onm
changes.  In Rust this will first compile the changes and then run the
application.  Because we put  in, it will try to first accept
the socket from .The end result is that you can edit your code, and it will recompile
automatically and restart the server without dropping any requests.  When
you run it, and perform changes, it will look a bit like this:$ systemfd --no-pid -s http::5555 -- watchexec -r -- cargo run
~> socket http://127.0.0.1:5555/ -> fd #3
[Running: cargo run]
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
     Running `target/debug/axum-test`
[Running: cargo run]
   Compiling axum-test v0.1.0 (/private/tmp/axum-test)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s
     Running `target/debug/axum-test`
For easier access, I recommend putting this into a  or similar
so you can just run  and it runs the server in watch mode.To install  you can use curl to bash:curl -sSfL https://github.com/mitsuhiko/systemfd/releases/latest/download/systemfd-installer.sh | sh
Now how does this work on Windows?  The answer is that  and
 have a custom, proprietary protocol that also makes socket
passing work on Windows.  That's a more complex system which involves a
local RPC server.  However the system does also support Windows and the
details about how it works are largely irrelevant for you as a user
— unless you want to implement that protocol for another programming
language.I really enjoy using this combination, but it can be quite frustrating to
require so many commands, and the command line workflow isn't optimal.
Ideally, this functionality would be better integrated into specific Rust
frameworks like axum and provided through a dedicated cargo plugin.  In a
perfect world, one could simply run , and everything
would work seamlessly.However, maintaining such an integrated experience is a much more involved
effort than what I have.  Hopefully, someone will be inspired to further
enhance the developer experience and achieve deeper integration with Rust
frameworks, making it more accessible and convenient for everyone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Linux foundation funded Chromium but not Firefox?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i589ug/why_linux_foundation_funded_chromium_but_not/</link><author>/u/ActiveCommittee8202</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 20:34:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In my opinion Chromium is a lost cause for people who wants free internet.

Nothing is impossible! Just plan what you will do with the right strategy. I am an interior architecture graduate and currently working as a Data Analyst Lead in one of Turkey's largest e-commerce companies.\
I’ve been asked this question a lot lately: “How can I become a Data Analyst?” Many people want to start but don’t know where to begin. In this article, I want to share a heartfelt guide, highlighting that becoming a Data Analyst isn’t just about learning technical skills, it’s about adopting the right mindset and what I did to focus during this process. If you’re ready to dive into this field, here’s a step-by-step roadmap for your journey.Ask Yourself: Why Do You Want to Be a Data Analyst?Like any profession, being a Data Analyst comes with its challenges and responsibilities. Before starting this journey, take a moment to reflect:Do you genuinely enjoy working with data? 🤓Does solving problems excite you? 🤩Are you passionate about finding stories hidden in numbers and sharing them with others? 🧐\
If your answer is “yes,” you’re off to a great start. This isn’t just a job: it’s a way of thinking, a curiosity-driven mindset.At its core, being a Data Analyst requires technical tools, but don’t let that intimidate you. These skills can be learned with time and practice. \
Here are the essentials: This is where most analysts begin. It might seem basic, but it’s powerful when mastered. The key to accessing and managing data. Without SQL, reaching the data you need can be a challenge. These programming languages allow for deeper analysis and automation of repetitive tasks.Data Visualization Tools: Turning data into visual insights is crucial for telling stories.\
The good news? All of these skills are learnable. You don’t have to master everything at once start with one and build gradually.Think Beyond the Technical: A Data Analyst’s MindsetBecoming a great Data Analyst isn’t just about crunching numbers. It’s about  and  your findings. Here are the key non-technical skills to focus on: Learn to break down complex problems into manageable steps. Think of data as a puzzle and develop a structured approach to solving it.Understanding the End User: Always consider who you’re analyzing the data for. What do they care about? What problems are they trying to solve? Tailor your insights accordingly. As an analyst, you’re the bridge between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders. Your ability to explain complex findings in simple terms can make all the difference.Defining the Problem Clearly: A well-defined problem is already half-solved. Before jumping into analysis, ask the right questions to clarify the scope and purpose of your work.Learn by Doing: Start Small ProjectsThe best way to learn is through hands-on experience. You don’t need to wait for a formal job to start practicing. Here are some ideas:Explore free datasets on platforms like Kaggle or public data portals and create your own reports.Try to understand which metrics they paid attention to in the shared reports and how they calculated them.Analyze your personal expenses to uncover spending patterns.Additionally, you may try tools like  for practicing SQL on real world big data without worrying about costs.You may use free version of Datastudio for visulisation .Every project, no matter how small, builds your confidence and portfolio.Build Your Network and Showcase Your SkillsOnce you’ve developed some foundational skills, it’s time to put yourself out there.\
Networking platforms like LinkedIn, online communities, and local meetups can help you connect with others in the field.\
Don't be afraid to share what you have learned with people, remember that everyone has something to learn from everyone else. Even if this information seems easy and simple to you after you learn it, there will always be people who don't know what you know.\
Create a portfolio showcasing your projects. It doesn’t have to be perfect, just authentic.\
Remember, your first job might not be your dream job, but it’s a stepping stone.Your Unique Story MattersEvery Data Analyst has a different journey. Some come from engineering, others from art or business backgrounds. The beauty of this field is that your unique perspective adds value. Don’t compare yourself to others, focus on your growth and your path.Becoming a Data Analyst is a journey filled with learning and growth. It’s about more than just mastering tools; it’s about developing a mindset that combines curiosity, problem-solving, and storytelling.\
If this article inspires even one person to take the first step, I’ll consider it a success. Remember: every great journey begins with a single step. \
Start where you are, and trust that you’ll grow along the way.\
Good luck on your journey, you’ve got this! 😊\
Thank you for your time; sharing is caring! 🌍]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Pentagon says AI is speeding up its ‘kill chain’</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/19/the-pentagon-says-ai-is-speeding-up-its-kill-chain/</link><author>Maxwell Zeff</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Leading AI developers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, are threading a delicate needle to sell software to the United States military: make the Pentagon more efficient, without letting their AI kill people.

But in fact, Wired reports, "China's Cyberspace Administration, the country's top internet watchdog, has reportedly already grown concerned about content being shared by foreigners on Xiaohongshu," and "warned the platform earlier this week to 'ensure China-based users can't see posts from U.S. users,' according to The Information." 

And that's just the beginning. Wired reports that RedNote is now also "scrambling to hire English-speaking moderators."

Social media platforms in China are legally required to remove a wide range of content, including nudity and graphic violence, but especially information that the government deems politically sensitive... "RedNote — like all platforms owned by Chinese companies — is subject to the Chinese Communist Party's repressive laws," wrote Allie Funk, research director for technology and democracy at the nonprofit human rights organization Freedom House, in an email to WIRED. "Independent researchers have documented how keywords deemed sensitive to those in power, such as discussion of labor strikes or criticism of Xi Jinping, can be scrubbed from the platform." 

But the influx of American TikTok users — as many as 700,000 in merely two days, according to Reuters — could be stretching Xiaohongshu's content moderation abilities thin, says Eric Liu, an editor at China Digital Times, a California-based publication documenting censorship in China, who also used to work as a content moderator himself for the Chinese social media platform Weibo... Liu reposted a screenshot on Bluesky showing that some people who recently joined Xiaohongshu have received notifications that their posts can only be shown to other users after 48 hours, seemingly giving the company time to determine whether they may be violating any of the platform's rules. This is a sign that Xiaohongshu's moderation teams are unable to react swiftly, Liu says... 

While the majority of the new TikTok refugees still appear to be enjoying their time on Xiaohongshu, some have already had their posts censored. Christine Lu, a Taiwanese-American tech entrepreneur who created a Xiaohongshu account on Wednesday, says she was suspended after uploading three provocative posts about Tiananmen, Tibet, and Taiwan. "I support more [Chinese and American] people engaging directly. But also, knowing China, I knew it wouldn't last for long," Lu tells WIRED. 

Despite the 700,000 signups in two days, "It's also worth nothing that the migration to RedNote is still very small, and only a fraction of the 170 million people in the US who use TikTok," notes The Conversation. (And they add that "The US government also has the authority to pressure Apple to remove RedNote from the US App Store if it thinks the migration poses a national security threat.") 

One nurse told the Los Angeles Times Americans signed up for the app because they "just don't want to give in" to "bullying" by the U.S. government. (The Times notes she later recorded a video acknowledging that on the Chinese-language app, "I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm reading, I'm just pressing buttons.")

On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials had discussed the possibility of selling TikTok to a trusted non-Chinese party such as Elon Musk, who already owns social media platform X. However, analysts said that Bytedance is unlikely to agree to a sale of the underlying algorithm that powers the app, meaning the platform under a new owner could still look drastically different.

So little time is essentially equivalent to simply running the command.Well, it's a combination of a misunderstanding, a misconfiguration, and the suggestion, 17 years ago, of a somewhat questionable unit of time by the Git maintainer himself.How was this designed to work?It's important to note that this is  the default functionality of Git.The  response to typing a command that doesn't exist is to simply not run anything, figure out which commands you might have meant by string similarity and then just exit. If most of you type , you'll probably get this instead:❯ git pushy
git: 'pushy' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
        pushOriginally, if you typed an unknown command, it would just say "this is not a git command". Then in 2008, Johannes Schindelin (somewhat jokingly) introduced a small patch to go through all the known commands, show you what is most similar to what you typed and if there is only one closely matching, simply run it.Then Alex Riesen introduced a patch to make it configurable via the  setting. In this initial patch, this setting was simply a boolean. Since Git config settings that expect a boolean will interpret a  value as , you could originally set  to  to have it automatically run the corrected command rather than just tell you what is similar.As part of the conversation around this patch, Junio Hamano, to this day the Git maintainer, suggested:Please make autocorrect not a binary but optionally the number of
deciseconds before it continues, so that I have a chance to hit ^C ;-)Which was what the setting value was changed to in the patch that was eventually accepted. This means that setting  to  logically means "wait 100ms (1 decisecond) before continuing".Now, why Junio thought  was a reasonable unit of time measurement for this is never discussed, so I don't really know why that is. Perhaps 1 full second felt too long so he wanted to be able to set it to half a second? We may never know. All we truly know is that this has never made sense to anyone ever since., the reason why it waits 100ms for David is that at some point he presumably learned about this setting, quite reasonably assumed that it was a boolean and set it to what Git config also generally considers to be a 'true' value in order to enable it:❯ git config --global help.autocorrect 1Not understanding that in this context, this means "wait 1 decisecond, then do whatever you think is best" rather than "please turn this feature on".So, clearly you can set it to  for a full second or whatever. However, over the years, this setting has gathered a few other options that it will recognize. According to the documentation, here are the values it can be set to:0 (default): show the suggested command.positive number: run the suggested command after specified deciseconds (0.1 sec)."immediate": run the suggested command immediately."prompt": show the suggestion and prompt for confirmation to run the command."never": don’t run or show any suggested command.Honestly, "prompt" is probably what most people would find the most reasonable, rather than a specific amount of time to wait for you to cancel the command.If you  want to have it prompt you, you can run this:❯ git config --global help.autocorrect prompt

❯ git pushy
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'pushy', which does not exist.
Run 'push' instead [y/N]?To keep picking on David, he followed up after doing some quick testing to see what the logic could be and it turns out that Git won't just take wild guesses. There is a point where it will simply assume you're way off and not guess anything:However, it's interesting to play around with this a bit:❯ git bass
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'bass', which does not exist.
Run 'rebase' instead [y/N]? n

❯ git bassa
git: 'bassa' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

❯ git dm
git: 'dm' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar commands are
        am
        rm

❯ git dma
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'dma', which does not exist.
Run 'am' instead [y/N]?So,  is close enough to  for it to guess that this could be what you mean. But  is not close enough for it to  think you maybe meant .Also,  could mean  or , but interestingly it matches on the end of the string and not necessarily from the beginning. Also,  confidently matches .As some of you may have guessed, it's based on a fairly simple, modified Levenshtein distance algorithm - which is basically a way to figure out how expensive it is to change one string into a second string given single character edits, with some operations being more expensive than others. It has a hard coded cutoff, so once it's too expensive for any of the known commands, it just assumes you really messed up, which is why some of these don't match anything and others, even though quite different, match several options.In going through a bunch of the related autocorrect Git code in order to research this little blog post, I realized that there could be a relatively simple and largely backwards compatible fix. Since a  value is so fast, it's in all human terms functionally equivalent to "immediately", I wrote up a small patch to interpret a  as "immediately" rather than "wait 100ms".Junio came back to request that instead of special casing the "1" string, we should properly interpret any boolean string value (so "yes", "no", "true", "off", etc), so version two of my patch is currently in flight to additionally do that. If I can get this landed, maybe future versions of Git will no longer test the mettle of Formula One drivers.Anyhow, hope you enjoyed that little trip down this old alley of seemingly strange Git functionality. As is often the case with Git, there is some hidden method to the apparent madness, and like any open source project, there is a path to make it slightly better!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>At least 80 dead, several kidnapped in Colombia after failed peace talks, official says</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kidnapped-colombia-peace-talks-fail-rebel-national-liberation-army/</link><author>/u/ChiefFun</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:19:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More than 80 people have been killed in Colombia's northeast region following failed attempts to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army, a Colombian official said.Twenty others have been injured, according to William Villamizar, governor of North Santander, where many of the killings occurred.Among the victims are community leader Carmelo Guerrero and seven people who sought to sign a peace deal, according to a report that a government ombudsman agency released late Saturday.Officials said the attacks occurred in several towns located in the Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, with at least three people who were part of the peace talks being kidnapped.Thousands of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains or seeking help at government shelters.Colombia's army rescued dozens of people on Sunday, including a family and their pet dog, whose owner held a pack of cold water against the animal's chest to keep it cool as they evacuated via helicopter.Defense Minister Iván Velásquez traveled to the northeast town of Cúcuta on Sunday while officials prepared to send 10 tons of food and hygiene kits for approximately 5,000 people in the communities of Ocaña and Tibú, the majority of them having fled the violence."Catatumbo needs help," Villamizar said in a public address on Saturday. "Boys, girls, young people, teenagers, entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation."The attack comes after Colombia suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, on Friday, the second time it has done so in less than a year.Colombia's government has demanded that the ELN cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid.The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations.In a statement Saturday, the ELN said it had warned former FARC members that if they "continued attacking the population...there was no other way out than armed confrontation." The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby.Army commander Gen. Luis Emilio Cardozo Santamaría said Saturday that authorities were reinforcing a humanitarian corridor between Tibú and Cúcuta for the safe passage of those forced to flee their homes. He said special urban troops also were deployed to municipal capitals "where there are risks and a lot of fear."The ELN has tried to negotiate a peace deal with the administration of President Gustavo Petro five times, with talks failing after bouts of violence. ELN demands include that it be recognized as a political rebel organization, which critics have said is risky.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Israeli army confirms handover of hostages | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdPhh2VjdSE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:18:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas.

He spent a lot of time (like 10y or so) writing infrastructure services in Golang as a part of his HashiCorp business and probably not only.His recent gig is a new terminal and he did not pick Golang for that one, which kinda make sense to me given what he wants to achieve there (eg a lot of low-level work with GPU, a need to be imported by other languages like Swift, etc.).At the same time, Mitchell said that:He doesn't know where Golang stands in the tech stack right now. He would use PHP/Ruby for webdev and Rust/Zig for performance critical systems.Generics made Golang worse (at least that how I understood him)He think he cannot write Golang any longer after hacking with the new lang he is writing the terminal inCurious how this transformation could happen to such a prominent contributor to the Golang ecosystem. Is this just an sign of an awful burnout that repelled the dude away from Golang? Or anything else?Anyway, just curious what do you think here, folks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Biden celebrates beginning of truce in Gaza, hostages released | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT2p-ZjZoMo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:09:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA['Today the guns in Gaza have gone silent,' Biden said in brief remarks welcoming the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.

Čoraz viac ľudí preto uvažuje o odchode z krajiny, a to aj z osobných dôvodov, lebo nechcú žiť tam, kde sa štátna politika vyznačuje takou mierou pohŕdania, výsmechu a útočnosti.Podobný list adresovala občanom a politikom aj Slovenská komora psychológov. Okrem iného v ňom upozorňujú na nebezpečnú normalizáciu násilia. Pripomínajú, že ak ho politici schvaľujú alebo tolerujú, ukazujú, že takéto správanie je v spoločnosti v poriadku.Vážený pán premiér, obraciame sa na Vás otvoreným listom ako občania a profesionáli v oblasti psychiatrie a psychológie.Ohrozenie demokracie na Slovensku a medzinárodného postavenia nášho štátu nás vedie k tomu, aby sme sa vyjadrili k Vášmu politickému správaniu a verejnému vystupovaniu. Vopred zdôrazňujeme, že nechceme hodnotiť Vašu osobnosť a sústredíme sa len na správanie z verejne dostupných zdrojov.Vaše politické správanie sa vyznačuje čoraz väčšou mierou mocensko-autoritatívneho štýlu, manipuláciou s faktami, klamaním, zhadzovaním a útokmi na politických oponentov, žurnalistov i bežných občanov, ktorí prejavia nesúhlas s Vašou politikou. Neštítite sa útokov na rodiny predstaviteľov opozície, ako to bolo v prípade Šimečkovcov.Dehonestujúco sa vyjadrujte k mladým ľuďom, ktorí oponujú Vašej politike, posmešne hodnotíte pleť mladého muža, posielate na diaľku „výchovné facky“ študentovi, ktorý odmietol podať ruku politickému predstaviteľovi, ktorého si neváži. Práve Vy, ktorý ste na svojich politických manifestáciách so svojim straníkmi povzbudzovali dav k vulgárnym označeniam vtedajšej prezidentky.Vaše politické správanie a proklamované postoje polarizujú spoločnosť a ovplyvňujú v nej emočnú atmosféru. Vedú k frustrácii a nespokojnosti veľkej časti obyvateľov Slovenska. Čoraz viac ľudí uvažuje o odchode z krajiny, nielen z pracovných či študijných, ale aj z osobných dôvodov. Nechcú žiť v krajine, kde sa štátna politika vyznačuje takou mierou pohŕdania, výsmechu a útočnosti.Vaša vnútroštátna politika smeruje hlavne k posilneniu Vašej moci, Vašich straníkov a koaličných partnerov. V krajine, ktorá tak zaostáva v budovaní infraštruktúry. V krajine, kde je zlý stav školstva a zdravotníctva, v oblastiach, v ktorých sme profesijne pôsobili celý život, ale Vám nestoja za to, aby ste ich považovali za „premiérske témy“. Podporujete ľudí, ktorí šíria konšpirácie, osočovanie a klamstvá a devastujú našu kultúru.Ešte viac sme zhrození Vašimi zahraničnopolitickými iniciatívami, ktoré sú často v priamom rozpore s politikou EU a NATO, ktorých je Slovensko členom. Vo vojne Ruska proti Ukrajine nejasne vyjadrujete, kto je brutálny agresor a kto brániaca sa obeť.Znevažujúco hovoríte o demokraticky zvolenom prezidentovi Ukrajiny, ktorá už tretí rok vedie nerovnú vojnu proti okupantom. Neváhate vycestovať do Moskvy a podávať ruku ruskému prezidentovi, ktorý nesie politickú a morálnu zodpovednosť za smrť desaťtisícov ľudí. Nielen vojakov, ale aj civilistov vrátane detí a ich únosov. Rusko devastuje infraštruktúru krajiny, útočí na civilné obydlia, školy, nemocnice a divadlá. K podobným ústretovým krokom voči ruskému imperializmu povzbudzujete aj spolustraníkov a koaličných partnerov.Zdá sa, že agresívnosť a emočná výbušnosť vo Vašom verejnom vystupovaní sa zvýraznila po atentáte na Vašu osobu. Tento čin ako prejav politického násilia jednoznačne odsudzujeme. Prežili ste nepochybne život ohrozujúci stres, ktorý môže mať dosah aj na Vaše fungovanie v budúcnosti.Predpokladáme, pán premiér, že viete o tom, že toto nie je prvý list odborníkov na mentálne zdravie premiérovi krajiny. 12. mája 1998 podpísala drvivá väčšina účastníkov Slovenského psychiatrického zjazdu v Košiciach list Vladimírovi Mečiarovi. Mnohé z výhrad k jeho politike, ktoré list obsahoval, sa týkali podobných tém, najmä ohrozenia demokracie a zaradenia krajiny do európskych a transatlantických štruktúr.V súčasnej politickej situácii nechceme čakať na konanie ďalšieho psychiatrického zjazdu. Posielame náš otvorený list aj vedeniu Slovenskej psychiatrickej spoločnosti, Slovenskej lekárskej spoločnosti a Slovenskej komory psychológov. Požiadame, aby ho zverejnili na svojich stránkach a umožnili svojim členom vyjadriť sa k obsahu a v prípade súhlasu sa mohli pripojiť k jeho zneniu.Dúfame v schopnosť Vašej sebareflexie a možnosti korekcie Vášho politického správania vrátane zváženia odchodu z vrcholovej politiky.prof.

My first thoughts? Let's move all create/edit/delete actions to the queue and notify users if their actions succeeded or not via WebSocket.\
But back then, I hadn't much experience with WebSockets in production, so my first step was to investigate how it works with the help of tutorials, stack overflow, and other sources.\
So, after some time, I got a gist of how it should work and started to prepare a code and mess around for a while with a load tests tool to simulate high traffic.Some questions and answers suggested calling the subscribe method on the Redis instance on the connected WebSocket client.io.sockets.on('connection', function (sockets) {
    sockets.emit('message',{Hello: 'World!'});
    sub.subscribe('attack-map-production');

    sockets.on('disconnect', function() {
            sub.unsubscribe('attack-map-production');
    });
});
\
But in this way, we are creating a new connection to Redis, so the memory usage in our application and Redis connection pool are rising. (Redis allows only 10k connections to one instance)\
That was a big no for me because I had to lower memory usage to a minimum.\
Right now, many articles, fortunately, mention that you should not create a new Redis connection on each WebSocket client.After creating a big chunk of business code, when I started the part with web sockets, a question popped into my mind - how to create them in a proper and safe way?\
I already had some events in the system, and some of them were ready to be additionally published via WebSockets, the rest of them were meant to stay inside the system.\
My gold promise was that I wouldn't have to change code drastically and still be able to send only selected events to websocket clients.\
That's why, at first, I created a Redis pub-sub module, as I thought that my events, in order to be visible in other instances, have to be transmitted via the Redis pub-sub pattern.\
Don't feel overwhelmed by looking at the module below, as I will explain details later in a use caseexport const REDIS_PUB_CLIENT = 'REDIS_PUB_CLIENT';
export const REDIS_SUB_CLIENT = 'REDIS_SUB_CLIENT';
export const REDIS_EVENT_PUB_SUB_REGISTER_EVENT_OPTIONS =
  'REDIS_EVENT_PUB_SUB_REGISTER_EVENT_OPTIONS';

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: REDIS_EVENT_PUB_SUB_REGISTER_EVENT_OPTIONS,
      useFactory: (options: RedisEventPubSubModuleOptions) => options,
      inject: [MODULE_OPTIONS_TOKEN],
    },
    {
      provide: REDIS_PUB_CLIENT,
      useFactory: async (options: RedisEventPubSubModuleOptions) => {
        const client = createClient({
          url: `redis://${options.host}:${options.port}`,
        });
        client.on('error', (err) => console.error('Redis Client Error', err));
        await client.connect();
        return client;
      },
      inject: [MODULE_OPTIONS_TOKEN],
    },
    {
      provide: EVENT_EMITTER_TOKEN,
      useFactory: (
        redisPubClient: RedisClientType,
        eventEmitter: EventEmitter2,
      ) => {
        return new RedisEventEmitter(redisPubClient, eventEmitter);
      },
      inject: [REDIS_PUB_CLIENT, EventEmitter2],
    },
    {
      provide: EVENT_SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN,
      useFactory: (eventEmitterSub: EventEmitter2) => {
        return new EventEmitter2EventSubscriber(eventEmitterSub);
      },
      inject: [EventEmitter2],
    },
  ],
  exports: [
    REDIS_PUB_CLIENT,
    EVENT_EMITTER_TOKEN,
    EVENT_SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN,
    REDIS_EVENT_PUB_SUB_REGISTER_EVENT_OPTIONS,
  ],
})
export class RedisEventPubSubModule extends ConfigurableModuleClass {
  static registerEvents(eventsPublishableNames: string[]): DynamicModule {
    return {
      module: class {},
      providers: [
        {
          provide: REDIS_SUB_CLIENT,
          useFactory: async (
            options: RedisEventPubSubModuleOptions,
            eventEmitter: EventEmitter2,
          ) => {
            const client = createClient({
              url: `redis://${options.host}:${options.port}`,
            });
            client.on('error', (err) =>
              console.error('Redis Client Error', err),
            );
            await client.connect();
            for (const eventPublishableName of eventsPublishableNames) {
              await client.subscribe(eventPublishableName, (message) => {
                const normalizedMessage = JSON.parse(
                  message,
                ) as PublishableEventInterface;
                delete (
                  normalizedMessage as Writeable<PublishableEventInterface>
                ).publishableEventName;
                eventEmitter.emit(eventPublishableName, normalizedMessage);
              });
            }
            return client;
          },
          inject: [REDIS_EVENT_PUB_SUB_REGISTER_EVENT_OPTIONS, EventEmitter2],
        },
      ],
    };
  }
}
\
This module takes care of creating/exposing a Pub Redis client and exposing an additional method - registerEvents, which is responsible for listening for given events on Redis pub-sub and re-emitting them via event emitter.\
It may be a little foggy for now. Why re-emitting events? Why do we need to register for those events? What are   and  and why do we have to export them?\
It will be more clear with real-life usage, so let's create a use case - chat messages. We want to be able to send messages via HTTP POST and receive them via WebSocket on the front end.@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})
export class UserChatModule {}
\
And an event that this module will be emitting after receiving a POST requestexport class NewMessageEvent {
  constructor(public readonly message: string) {}
}
\
In the controller, we have to make it possible to emit events both for our system and the Redis pub queue. We will use wrapped export const EVENT_EMITTER_TOKEN = 'EVENT_EMITTER_TOKEN';

export class RedisEventEmitter implements EventEmitterInterface {
  constructor(
    private redisPubClient: RedisClientType,
    private eventEmitter: EventEmitter2,
  ) {}

  async emit(eventName: string, payload: Record<any, any>): Promise<void> {
    this.eventEmitter.emit(eventName, payload);

    if (this.isPublishableEvent(payload)) {
      await this.redisPubClient.publish(
        payload.publishableEventName,
        JSON.stringify(payload),
      );
    }
  }

  private isPublishableEvent(event: any): event is PublishableEventInterface {
    return event.publishableEventName !== undefined;
  }
}
\
And then, we are able to use it in our controller@Controller('messages')
export class SendMessageAction {
  constructor(
    // Previously eventEmitter2
    @Inject(EVENT_EMITTER_TOKEN)
    private readonly eventEmitter: EventEmitterInterface,
  ) {}

  @Post()
  async handle(@Body() request: SendMessageHttpRequest) {
    await this.eventEmitter.emit(
      NewMessageEvent.name,
      new NewMessageEvent(request.content),
    );
  }
}
\
But before that, we have to enhance our event with PublishableEventInterface in order to allow RedisEventEmitter to catch our event and emit it in the Redis pub queue.export class NewMessageEvent implements PublishableEventInterface {
  static publishableEventName = 'events:new-message';

  publishableEventName = NewMessageEvent.publishableEventName;

  constructor(public readonly message: string) {}
}
\
Great, we are now sending our events like we used to, but now, if they are marked as publishable, they will land in the Redis pub queue.But now, we need to make it possible to receive those events on WebSocket, right?So, let's take a look at our user chat module@Module({
  imports: [
    RedisEventPubSubModule.registerEvents([
      NewMessageEvent.publishableEventName,
    ]),
  ],
  controllers: [SendMessageAction],
  providers: [],
})
export class UserChatModule {}
\
As you can see, we used the method mentioned earlier - registerEvents.Thanks to that method, we told RedisEventPubSubModule that it should listen for our NewMessageEvent event in the Redis pub-sub queue on the publishableEventName attribute.\
So, if any NewMessageEvent event occurs, then it will be re-emitted as a normal NewMessageEvent event, but under the publishableEventName attribute.\
It's worth mentioning, that it will work on 1 instance or 1,000 instances. So even if we scale to a high number of instances, each of them will receive this and re-emit this event inside the system.\
So, now we have abilities to emit events and listen for them. Now we need to deliver them to our websocket clients.Let's take a look at Websocket Gatewayexport enum WebsocketEventSubscribeList {
  FETCH_EVENTS_MESSAGES = 'fetch-events-messages',
  EVENTS_MESSAGES_STREAM = 'events-messages-stream',
}

@WebSocketGateway({
  pingInterval: 30000,
  pingTimeout: 5000,
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
  },
})
export class MessagesWebsocketGateway {
  constructor(
    @Inject(EVENT_SUBSCRIBER_TOKEN)
    private eventSubscriber: EventSubscriberInterface,
  ) {}

  @SubscribeMessage(WebsocketEventSubscribeList.FETCH_EVENTS_MESSAGES)
  async streamMessagesData(@ConnectedSocket() client: any) {
    const stream$ = this.createWebsocketStreamFromEventFactory(
      client,
      this.eventSubscriber,
      NewMessageEvent.publishableEventName,
    );

    const event = WebsocketEventSubscribeList.EVENTS_MESSAGES_STREAM;
    return from(stream$).pipe(map((data) => ({ event, data })));
  }

  private createWebsocketStreamFromEventFactory(
    client: any,
    eventSubscriber: EventSubscriberInterface,
    eventName: string,
  ): Observable<any> {
    return new Observable((observer) => {
      const dynamicListener = (message: PublishableEventInterface) => {
        observer.next(message);
      };

      eventSubscriber.on(eventName, dynamicListener);

      client.on('disconnect', () => {
        eventSubscriber.off(eventName, dynamicListener);
      });
    });
  }
}
\
So there is a thing, in the constructor, we have EVENTTOKEN, which type is EventSubscriberInterface. But what it really does? This is how it looks under the hoodexport class EventEmitter2EventSubscriber implements EventSubscriberInterface {
  constructor(private eventEmitter: EventEmitter2) {}

  on(name: string, listener: any): void {
    this.eventEmitter.on(name, listener);
  }

  off(name: string, listener: any): void {
    this.eventEmitter.removeListener(name, listener);
  }
}
\
It's just a wrapper for EventEmitter2, that we are using in the method createWebsocketStreamFromEventFactory private createWebsocketStreamFromEventFactory(
    client: any,
    eventSubscriber: EventSubscriberInterface,
    eventName: string,
  ): Observable<any> {
    return new Observable((observer) => {
      const dynamicListener = (message: PublishableEventInterface) => {
        observer.next(message);
      };

      eventSubscriber.on(eventName, dynamicListener);

      client.on('disconnect', () => {
        eventSubscriber.off(eventName, dynamicListener);
      });
    });
  }
}
\
We are using this wrapped EventEmitter2 to create dynamic listeners on publishableName when websocket clients connect and remove on disconnect.\
Then, we are doing nothing more than creating rxjs stream to keep the websocket connection and send messages from the listener via observer.next(message); when a new message occurs.How this event will reach our listeners?\
If you return to the first snippet of code, our Redis pub sub module, then you can spot this in the registerEvents method for (const eventPublishableName of eventsPublishableNames) {
              await client.subscribe(eventPublishableName, (message) => {
                const normalizedMessage = JSON.parse(
                  message,
                ) as PublishableEventInterface;
                delete (
                  normalizedMessage as Writeable<PublishableEventInterface>
                ).publishableEventName;
                eventEmitter.emit(eventPublishableName, normalizedMessage);
              });
\
Which basically listens for events on the pub queue, and then re-emit them via the event emitter.\
So, let's sum up what we have done hereWe are still using our events in the system like we used to via EventEmitter2, but if we want to publish to our connected websocket clients, then all we have to do is implement PublishableInterfaceWe are not creating new Redis connections on each connected websocket clientWe can scale up our system to X instances and it will still behave in the same way - each connected client will get a copy of the event via websocket, no matter to which instance they will be connected]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Gamekins Integrates Gamification into Continuous Integration for Better Testing</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-gamekins-integrates-gamification-into-continuous-integration-for-better-testing?source=rss</link><author>Gamifications FTW Publications</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 18:57:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[3.2 Gamification Elements of GamekinsWe aim to improve testing courses by incentivizing students to test more and better using the CI system underlying their coding tasks. For this, we developed a tool, Gamekins [47] [2], which incorporates gamification elements into CI based on static code, coverage, and mutation analysis. The combination of underlying quality metrics is intended to shift the students’ focus away from solely relying on one metric. To enforce better commit and testing behavior, Gamekins provides gamification elements only after new commits.\
The general workflow of Gamekins is as follows[3]: Developers commit code changes to a version control system, which triggers a job in the Jenkins CI environment. Jenkins executes a build job, which includes running the project’s tests, and then invokes Gamekins. Gamekins utilizes information from the run and the version control system to update and generate challenges, quests, achievements, and the leaderboard.\
. Gamekins offers a variety of seven distinct challenge types, each designed to provide developers with specific test and quality-related tasks to complete:[3]\
 This challenge requires developers to resolve a build failure. To prevent misuse of Gamekins by repeatedly breaking and fixing the build for points, this challenge is generated only once per week.\
 This generic challenge requires developers to write at least one additional test without specifying the specific code area to target.\
• Class Coverage Challenge: This challenge type focuses on increasing code coverage for a selected Java class.\
• Method Coverage Challenge: This challenge focuses on improving the coverage of a specific target method.\
• Line Coverage Challenge: This challenge focuses on improving the coverage of a specific line of code that is not fully covered. The task is to either cover or increase the branch coverage of the line. • Mutation Challenge: This challenge focuses on detecting a specific mutant by adding or improving a test, and therefore goes beyond a simple check of the robustness of the test suite to closing test gaps [38]. The mutants are generated with PIT[4], a popular mutation testing tool for Java.\
 This challenge involves analyzing a target class using SonarLint[5], a code quality tool. The challenge is to choose one of the detected smells in either the source or test files and remove it.\
In order to generate new challenges, Gamekins ensures that there is always a (configurable) fixed number of current challenges. When generating a new challenge, Gamekins only considers recently changed classes based on the commit history. This ensures that the challenge is relevant to the functionality currently considered by the developer. To generate a challenge, Gamekins first ranks all classes in the project under test based on the current code coverage, then probabilistically selects a class for the challenge, giving higher chances to classes with lower coverage; finally, a challenge type is randomly selected, and a random instance for this type is generated.\
If a developer already has open challenges, Gamekins checks if these challenges have been solved. If they have been solved, Gamekins will generate new challenges to replace them. Additionally, Gamekins also checks if all currently open challenges are still applicable, for example by verifying if the specific code fragment for a challenge has not been deleted. To keep developers informed, all current challenges are displayed on a dedicated page in Jenkins, which provides an overview of open challenges and their status (Fig. 1). Clicking on a challenge provides additional information, including the code snippet mentioned in the challenge description, as well as an explanation of what needs to be done. This information is particularly important for Mutation Challenges, where both the modified source code and the original code are shown.\
To remove a current challenge from the list, participants can click on the Reject button. When rejecting a challenge, participants are required to provide a reason, which aims to limit rejections and helps to improve Gamekins. Some possible reasons for rejecting a challenge include cases where the challenge is unnecessary due to defensive programming or when reported code smells are intentionally present in the code. In some cases, challenges may be\
automatically rejected if, for example, the target line or class has been removed. If a Class Coverage Challenge is rejected, this will block the future generation of any challenges in the class that the rejected challenge was targeting. However, this can be undone in the list of rejected challenges if necessary.\
 Quests are a way to group multiple challenges together. They consist of a series of individual challenges that need to be solved one after the other. In a quest, only the current challenge that needs to be solved next is enabled and can be expanded to show more details (Fig. 2). The successive challenges in the quest are disabled and cannot be viewed until it is their turn to be solved. To earn points for a quest, all steps must be solved in succession. Gamekins supports a total of nine different types of quests3].\
Quests are created by checking the prerequisites of potential quests, such as ensuring that a sufficient number of required challenges can be generated. One quest is then randomly chosen from the available options. The individual steps or challenges within a quest are generated as if they were standalone challenges but with predetermined classes based on the quest type. Participants have the option to reject quests, or quests can be automatically rejected by Gamekins if at least one of the challenges within the quest becomes unsolvable. In this case, participants will receive points for the challenges they have already solved within the quest, but not for the steps themselves.\
 By completing challenges and quests, users earn points, and their point rankings are displayed on a leaderboard in Jenkins. The leaderboard not only shows the points but also the total number of completed challenges and achievements, fostering competition. Participants can personalize their experience by selecting one of the 50 avatars to be displayed on the leaderboard.\

3.2.4 Achievements. Developers are rewarded for their test achievements, which are based on specific behaviors or actions they perform, regardless of specific challenges. These achievements have\
varying difficulty, ranging from easy tasks, like having a test in a project, to more challenging ones, like achieving 100 % coverage. Currently, Gamekins implements 63 achievements, and developers can view obtained and open achievements (Fig. 4). Some achievements are kept secret and are only revealed once they are completed.3.3 Gamified Elements and the Testing CurriculumBesides offering general incentives, the integration of Gamekins into coursework allows to address several learning objectives outlined in the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering [2], such as:\
• Static analysis (VAV.rev.3) and refactoring (PRO.evo.3), e.g., with Smell Challenges\
• Unit (VAV.tst.1) and integration (VAV.tst.5) testing with Challenges and Quests\
• Testing edge cases and boundary conditions with Mutation Challenges (VAV.tst.2) • Coverage analysis with Coverage Challenges (VAV.tst.3)\
• Regression testing (VAV.tst.10), testing tools and automation (VAV.tst.11) with Gamekins as CI plugin\
• Build processes (PRO.cm.4) and analyzing failure reports (VAV.par.1) with Gamekins as CI plugin[2] Available at https://gamekins.org\

Very often, it is part of general software engineering courses, where time dedicated to testing tends to be limited [25]. However, dedicated software testing courses are becoming more common. Dedicating an entire course to software testing provides the opportunity to cover many different facets of testing, ranging from testing techniques to automating testing, and also how to firmly integrate testing during software development.3.1 Challenges in Teaching Software TestingAt the University of Passau, we established a mandatory undergraduate course on software testing in 2018. Grading is based entirely on coursework, forcing the students to engage practically with testing challenges at different levels. Besides covering the standard portfolio of techniques common in software quality assurance, where testing in practice is often conducted by dedicated software testers, we also aim to cover developer testing, i.e., the tight integration of testing into regular software development activities. Thus, one of the course aims is to establish testing as a routine activity that students perform when developing their own software.\
However, throughout multiple iterations of the course, we observed several issues inhibiting this aim: Students exhibit a lack of motivation to write tests, which results in them writing only the bare minimum number of tests required to meet a certain goal (e.g., if code coverage is required). This also indicates that students tend to overly focus on metrics, in particular code coverage, which is easy to obtain and understand. Further evidence for the lack of engagement can be found in the students’ commit logs: Rather than including tests throughout the process and using fine-grained commits [42], testing is usually conducted as a post-hoc exercise. Anecdotally, we also observed general weaknesses such as hardcoded test data (e.g., paths to test resources) which may not be reflected in the metrics students aim for but suggest a lack of proper engagement with testing. Consequently, there is a need for further incentives to establish testing in regular software development.(1) Philipp Straubinger, University of Passau, Germany;(2) Gordon Fraser, University of Passau, Germany.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Boosting Developer Engagement in Software Testing with Gamification</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/boosting-developer-engagement-in-software-testing-with-gamification?source=rss</link><author>Gamifications FTW Publications</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 18:56:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Software developers have access to various tools and metrics that help them identify how to improve their tests, such as code coverage, which identifies statements, branches, or execution paths that have not been covered by tests. This measurement is achieved by recording the parts of the application that are reached during test execution, resulting in lists of uncovered lines of code, percentages of covered code, and visualizations of the coverage [53]. Mutation analysis [28] assesses the effectiveness of test suites by inserting artificial faults (mutants) into a program and checking whether the tests can detect them and provides guidance on additional tests if not. Static code analysis is used to identify common patterns in the code that may lead to potential bugs. For example, patterns such as code [17] and test [48] smells suggest where code should be refactored or removed by developers to improve code quality.\
Although there are various metrics and tools for software testing, they are often not widely used in an automated manner [6]. Continuous integration (CI) is a common solution to this problem: CI allows developers to automatically execute their tests and calculate metrics such as code coverage after each push to a remote repository [8]. This enables developers to focus on writing code and tests in their IDE, while the CI system performs analyses and provides a summary of findings and uncovered code [44]. The use of CI platforms has been shown to improve productivity and enable faster software releases with higher quality [43, 52].2.2 Gamification of Software TestingThe lack of motivation to write tests and to use test automation can at least partially be attributed to the perception of testing as being tedious, stressful, uncreative [30, 49, 50], or not appreciated [13, 14]. Motivation, which is crucial for developer productivity [18–20], can be intrinsic, describing the inner willingness to participate in an activity, or it can refer to an external signal related to a task. Gamification is a way to provide external motivation, and it does so using game design elements within non-game contexts [15]. Gamification has been shown to increase engagement and improve results compared to non-gamified development environments [11, 45]. The most common gamification elements include points, badges, and leaderboards, but other elements such as challenges and achievements are also often applicable [39].\
In the context of software testing, gamification has been applied in both professional (e.g., [37, 40]) and educational (e.g., [5, 21, 22, 51]) settings. Previous attempts to gamify software testing education have focused on specific aspects such as mutation testing [21] or security testing [22]. Our aim is orthogonal: Rather than teaching specific test techniques, we aim to get students to integrate testing into their regular software development routine.(1) Philipp Straubinger, University of Passau, Germany;(2) Gordon Fraser, University of Passau, Germany.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gamification Makes It Easier to Teach Software Testing – New Study Shows</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/gamification-makes-it-easier-to-teach-software-testing-new-study-shows?source=rss</link><author>Gamifications FTW Publications</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 18:56:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Philipp Straubinger, University of Passau, Germany;(2) Gordon Fraser, University of Passau, Germany.Testing plays a crucial role in software development, and it is essential for software engineering students to receive proper testing education. However, motivating students to write tests and use automated testing during software development can be challenging. To address this issue and enhance student engagement in testing when they write code, we propose to incentivize students to test more by gamifying continuous integration. For this we use Gamekins, a tool that is seamlessly integrated into the Jenkins continuous integration platform and uses game elements based on commits to the source code repository: Developers can earn points by completing test challenges and quests generated by Gamekins, compete with other developers or teams on a leaderboard, and receive achievements for their test-related accomplishments. In this paper, we present our integration of Gamekins into an undergraduate-level course on software testing. We observe a correlation between how students test their code and their use of Gamekins, as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy of their results compared to a previous iteration of the course without gamification. As a further indicator of how this approach improves testing behavior, the students reported enjoyment in writing tests with Gamekins.\

Software Testing, Gamification, Continuous Integration, Education\
Philipp Straubinger and Gordon Fraser. 2024. Gamifying a Software Testing Course with Continuous Integration. In 46th International Conference on Software Engineering: : Software Engineering Education and Training (ICSESEET ’24), April 14–20, 2024, Lisbon, Portugal. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 12 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3639474.3640054Software testing is a well-established concept and is extensively used in the industry [13]. However, despite the availability of various tools that facilitate the testing process, such as testing support in integrated development environments (IDE) [26] and automated test execution in continuous integration (CI) platforms [8], testing is often overlooked in practice. Speculated reasons for this include developers’ lack of motivation to engage in testing activities and a lack of education in software testing [14, 30, 41, 49, 50]. Although the often inadequate treatment of testing in higher education [41] has recently been countered with a growing recognition of the importance of testing [9, 29, 35], this is nevertheless hampered by learners just like developers tending to perceive testing as tedious and boring [32]. As a result, the industry suffers significant losses due to inadequate software quality and insufficient testing [31].\
Gamification techniques provide an opportunity to motivate students to test despite their perception of it being boring or tedious. Gamification involves incorporating elements commonly found in games, such as leaderboards and achievements, into nongame contexts [15]. It has been demonstrated that this approach helps engage students in software engineering education [24], for example by gamifying lectures or tools to teach software testing [7, 12, 16, 22, 36]. However, in order for students to internalize testing and establish it as an integral part of their development approach, we argue that seamless integration of gamification of testing into the software development process is necessary.\
In order to achieve this, we integrate gamification into continuous integration (CI) systems used by students. Specifically, we use Gamekins [47], a plugin designed for the widely used CI platform Jenkins[1], which seamlessly integrates gamification into the software development workflow. By analyzing source code and test results, Gamekins identifies areas where testing can be improved based on code coverage [53] or mutation analysis [28] and then incentivizes improvement using gamification concepts such as challenges and quests, rewarding good testing with points, achievements, and leaderboard rankings. We evaluated the benefits of integrating Gamekins in an undergraduate software testing course, investigating its impact on the course’ learning objectives and student behavior. In detail, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\
• We propose the use of gamification as a means to incentivize and reward testing activities in CI.\
• We introduceGamekins as a tool to be used in an undergraduate-level software testing course.\
• We empirically evaluate the effects of integrating Gamekins into the software testing course, comparing to a previous cohort without gamification and surveying the students.\
The results of the study demonstrate a correlation between students’ testing behavior and the use of Gamekins, as well as a significant improvement in correct results compared to the previous edition of the course, where no gamification was used on the same assignments. While not all aspects of Gamekins were universally liked by students, overall, they enjoyed its use throughout the course, confirming that Gamekins is a viable teaching tool.[1] https://www.jenkins.io/]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Video shows three Israeli hostages in Israel as fragile ceasefire passes first hurdle</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQC_UQnb0a4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 18:40:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Three Israeli hostages released from Gaza have been handed over to Israeli forces and crossed into Israel in the first test of a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

This means that the extension created files which were not managed by Postgres and could read the contents of those files directly from disk.
While it’s not uncommon for Postgres extensions to do this, block storage has enabled  to simultaneously achieve:Postgres write-ahead log (WAL) integration, which is necessary for physical replication of the indexCrash and point-in-time recoveryFull support for Postgres MVCC (multi-version concurrency control)Integration with Postgres’ buffer cache, which has led to massive improvements in index creation times and write throughputMoving to block storage has been one our biggest engineering bets. At first, we weren’t sure if reconciling the data access patterns and concurrency model of Postgres and Tantivy — 's underlying search library — was possible without drastic changes to Tantivy.This is part one of a three-part series. In this part, we’ll dive into how we architected 's new block storage layout and data access patterns. Part two will discuss how we designed and tested  to be MVCC-safe in update-heavy scenarios. Part three will dive into how we customized the block storage layout for analytical workloads (e.g. faceted search, aggregates).Block storage is Postgres’ storage API that backs all of Postgres’ tables and built-in index types. The fundamental unit of block storage is a block: a chunk of 8192 bytes. When executing a query, Postgres reads blocks into buffers, which are stored in Postgres’ buffer cache.DML (, , , ) statements do not modify the physical block. Instead, their changes are written to the underlying buffers, which are later flushed to disk when evicted from the buffer cache or during a checkpoint.If Postgres crashes, modifications to buffers that have not been flushed can become lost. To guard against this, any changes to the index must be written to the write-ahead log (WAL). During crash recovery, Postgres replays the WAL to restore the database to its most recent state.pg_search is a Postgres extension that implements a custom index for full text search and analytics. The extension is powered by Tantivy, a search library written in Rust and inspired by Lucene.Why Migrate To Block Storage?A custom Postgres index has two choices for persistence: use Postgres block storage or the filesystem. At first, using the filesystem may seem like the easier option. Integrating with block storage requires solving a series of problems:Some data structures may not fit within a single 8KB block. Splitting data across multiple blocks can create lock contention, garbage collection, and concurrency challenges.Once a block has been allocated to a Postgres index, it cannot be physically deleted — only recycled. This means that the size of an index strictly increases until a  or  is run. The index must be careful to return blocks that have been tombstoned by deletes or vacuums to Postgres’ free space map for reuse.In update-heavy scenarios, the index can become dominated by space that once belonged to dead (i.e. deleted) rows. This may increase the number of I/O operations required for searches and updates, which degrades performance. The index must find ways to reorganize and compact the index during vacuums.Because Postgres is single-threaded, multiple threads cannot concurrently read from block storage. The index may need to leverage Postgres’ parallel workers.Once the index overcomes these hurdles, however, Postgres block storage does an incredible amount of heavy lifting. After a year of working with the filesystem, it became clear that block storage was the way forward.Being able to use the buffer cache means a huge reduction in disk I/O and massive improvements to read and write throughput.Postgres provides a simple, battle-tested API to write buffers to the WAL. Without block storage, extensions must define custom WAL record types and implement their own WAL replay logic, which drastically increases complexity and surface area for bugs.Postgres handles the physical creation and cleanup of files for us. The index doesn’t need to clean up after aborted transactions or  statements.Tantivy’s File-Based Index LayoutThe first challenge was migrating Tantivy’s file-based index layout to block storage. Let’s quickly examine how Tantivy’s index is structured.A Tantivy index is comprised of multiple segments. A segment is like a database shard — it contains a subset of the documents in the index. Each segment, in turn, is made up of multiple files:: Stores a mapping of terms to document IDs and term frequencies, allowing Tantivy to efficiently retrieve documents that contain a specific term. This is the backbone of the inverted index.: Tracks the positions of terms within documents, enabling phrase queries by identifying where terms appear in relation to each other.: Contains the list of unique terms in the index and metadata for each term, such as document frequency and offsets into the postings file.: Stores normalization factors for each field in a document, which are used to adjust term scores during ranking.: Columnar storage for numeric and categorical fields, enabling fast filtering and sorting.: A bitset that tracks which documents in the segment have been deleted.: Stores the original document. This file is not used by  since the heap table already contains the original value.New segments are created whenever new documents are committed to the index. To maintain a target segment count, Tantivy’s merge process combines smaller segments into a single, larger segment.When a segment is created, Tantivy assigns it a unique UUID. Segments are tracked across two files. The first file contains a  of all files in the index. The second file contains a list of segment UUIDs that are currently visible. If a segment is present in first file but not the second, that means that the segment has been tombstoned by the merge process and is subject to being removed by garbage collection.In addition, the second file also stores index’s schema and settings.Tantivy uses a file-based locking approach — if a lock file exists, then the lock is being held by another process. Locks are important for Tantivy because Tantivy is not a database capable of handling concurrent readers and writers. They ensure that only one writer exists per index, and that reads and writes to the metadata files are atomic. In Part 2, we’ll discuss how we used Postgres MVCC controls to lift Tantivy’s “one writer per index” limitation.Migrating to a Block Storage LayoutRather than being written to a file, segments are serialized and written to blocks. Large segments that spill past a single block are stored in a linked list of blocks.Separate blocks are used to store the index schema, settings, and list of segment UUIDs.Postgres MVCC visibility information is stored alongside each segment UUID. At query time, the extension uses MVCC visibility rules to construct a snapshot of the list of all visible segments, which eliminates the need for a second list of visible segments.Tantivy’s lock files are no longer needed since Postgres provides buffer-level, interprocess locking mechanisms.Challenge 1: Large Files Can Spill Over a Single BlockA segment file can exceed an 8KB block. To accommodate these files, we implement a linked list over block storage, where each block is a node.The linked list starts with a header block that contains a bitpacked representation of all subsequent block numbers. This structure enables O(1) lookups by directly mapping the starting offset of any byte range to its position in the list.After the header block, the next block stores the file’s serialized data. Once the block becomes full, a new block is allocated. In Postgres, every block has an area reserved for metadata called special data. The current block's special data section is updated to store the block number of the newly allocated block, forming the linked list.Challenge 2: Blocks Cannot Be Memory MappedTantivy’s data access patterns for fast fields assume that the underlying file can be memory mapped, which means that Tantivy can leverage zero-copy access for the entire fast field. This is not the case for block storage — the buffer cache can only provide a pointer to the contents of a single block. If a fast field spans multiple blocks, each block must be copied into memory, introducing significant overhead.To address this problem, we modified Tantivy to defer dereferencing large slices of bytes up front. Instead, bytes are dereferenced lazily and
cached in memory to avoid re-reading blocks that have been previously accessed.Challenge 3: The Segment Count Explodes in Update-Heavy ScenariosBecause segments are immutable, every DML statement in Tantivy creates at least one new segment. Having too many segments can degrade performance because there is a cost to opening a segment reader, searching over the segment, and merging the results with other segments. While the ideal number of segments depends on the dataset and the underlying hardware, having more than a hundred segments is generally not optimal.If a table experiences a high volume of updates, the number of segments quickly explodes. To address this, we introduce a step called  , which looks for merge opportunities after an  completes.It is critical that only one merge process runs concurrently. If two merge processes run at the same time, they could both see the same segments, merge them together, and create duplicate segments. To guard against this, every merge process atomically writes its transaction ID to a metadata block. Subsequent merge attempts first read this transaction ID, and are only allowed to proceed if the effects of that transaction ID are MVCC-visible.The following parts of this blog post series will dive into some more exciting challenges we faced with block storage, with a focus on concurrency and analytical performance.ZomboDB and pg_parquet are examples of Postgres extensions that directly interact with the filesystem.Fortunately this ended up not being the case.This will be covered in detail in Parts 2 and 3.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>MicroPie - An ultra-micro Python web framework that gets out of your way</title><link>https://patx.github.io/micropie/</link><author>/u/Miserable_Ear3789</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 18:33:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trucks loaded with aid cross into Gaza Strip as ceasefire takes hold</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNhNLEL4_E0</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 18:31:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The United Nations’ World Food Program said trucks carrying aid started entering Gaza on Sunday through two crossings, after the ceasefire took hold.

 TikTok appears to be coming back online just hours after President-elect Donald Trump pledged Sunday that he would sign an executive order Monday that aims to restore the banned app. Around 12 hours after first shutting itself down, U.S. users began to have access to TikTok on a web browser and in the app, although the page still showed a warning about the shutdown. 

The brief outage was "the first time in history the U.S. government has outlawed a widely popular social media network," reports NPR. Apple and Google removed TikTok from their app stores. (And Apple also removed Lemon8). 


The incoming president announced his pending executive order "in a post on his Truth Social account," reports the Associated Press, "as millions of TikTok users in the U.S. awoke to discover they could no longer access the TikTok app or platform." 
But two Republican Senators said Sunday that the incoming president doesn't have the power to pause the TikTok ban. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Peter Ricketts of Nebraska posted on X.com that "Now that the law has taken effect, there's no legal basis for any kind of 'extension' of its effective date. For TikTok to come back online in the future, ByteDance must agree to a sale... severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posted to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok." 

The Associated Press reports that the incoming president offered this rationale for the reprieve in his Truth Social post. "Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations."

The law gives the sitting president authority to grant a 90-day extension if a viable sale is underway. Although investors made a few offers, ByteDance previously said it would not sell. In his post on Sunday, Trump said he "would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture," but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to the government or an American company... 

"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.," a pop-up message informed users who opened the TikTok app and tried to scroll through videos on Saturday night. "Unfortunately that means you can't use TikTok for now." The service interruption TikTok instituted hours earlier caught most users by surprise. Experts had said the law as written did not require TikTok to take down its platform, only for app stores to remove it. Current users had been expected to continue to have access to videos until the app stopped working due to a lack of updates... "We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned," read the pop-up message... 




Apple said the apps would remain on the devices of people who already had them installed, but in-app purchases and new subscriptions no longer were possible and that operating updates to iPhones and iPads might affect the apps' performance. 

In the nine months since Congress passed the sale-or-ban law, no clear buyers emerged, and ByteDance publicly insisted it would not sell TikTok. But Trump said he hoped his administration could facilitate a deal to "save" the app. TikTok CEO Shou Chew is expected to attend Trump's inauguration with a prime seating location. Chew posted a video late Saturday thanking Trump for his commitment to work with the company to keep the app available in the U.S. and taking a "strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship...." 
On Saturday, artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI submitted a proposal to ByteDance to create a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter...
 
The article adds that TikTok "does not operate in China, where ByteDance instead offers Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing's strict censorship rules." 

Sunday morning Republican House speaker Mike Johnson offered his understanding of Trump's planned executive order, according to Politico. Speaking on Meet the Press, Johnson said "the way we read that is that he's going to try to force along a true divestiture, changing of hands, the ownership. 

"It's not the platform that members of Congress are concerned about. It's the Chinese Communist Party and their manipulation of the algorithms."

I will cover Network Namespaces and Linux Bridges in this blog post.\
Linux Namespaces wiki saysNamespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partition kernel resources 
such that one set of processes sees one set of resources, while another set 
of processes sees a different set of resources.
\
So, the process isolation is provided using namespaces and cgroups. This allows each process to see its personal view of the system (files, process, network interfaces, hostname).\
Another excerpt from the wiki.ince kernel version 5.6, there are 8 kinds of namespaces. 
Network namespaces virtualize the network stack. On creation, a network 
namespace contains only a loopback interface. Each network interface 
(physical or virtual) is present in exactly 1 namespace and can be moved 
between namespaces. 
\
ip-netns utility helps to create network namespaces. Let’s see how.Create a network namespaces.\
Only the loopback interface is available in  namespace.sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK> mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
\
The following diagram helps to visualize the setup.For brevity, I will not list  and  interfaces in the rest of the diagrams.\
Now, let’s create a  pair.sudo ip link add vethX type veth peer name vethY
sudo ip link set vethX up
sudo ip link set vethY up
Attach one end of the  pair to  namespace.sudo ip link set vethX netns ns1
This ensures processes in the default/root namespace cannot see  interface.ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 02:fd:4d:34:55:76 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
18: vethY@if19: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 5a:bc:4d:7e:76:b1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netns ns1
\
And processes in  namespace could not see  interface.sudo ip netns exec ns1 ip link
1: lo: <LOOPBACK> mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
19: vethX@if18: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 5e:4b:13:90:7d:63 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
\
In a similar fashion, we can create another namespace. Create a new  pair. And then attach one end of  pair to a namespace.udo ip netns add ns2
sudo ip link add vethP type veth peer name vethQ
sudo ip link set vethP up
sudo ip link set vethQ up
sudo ip link set vethP netns ns2
Now, the last part is to connect these two namespaces with a Bridge.\
A bridge connects two LAN segments together. We will create a new bridge and attach  and  to this bridge.sudo ip link add name br0 type bridge
sudo ip link set dev br0 up
sudo ip link set vethY master br0
sudo ip link set vethQ master br0
As we have looked in the last blog post, any packet on bridge  is seen on all the  we have created. You can try it for yourself.\
Now, by this time, you might have started imagining how a container achieves network isolation using Virtual Ethernet, Bridge, and Linux Namespaces. We will take a look at the docker container in the next blog post.\
Before you jump to the next article, let’s clean up the setup.sudo ip link del br0
sudo ip link del vethY
sudo ip link del vethQ
sudo ip netns del ns1
sudo ip netns del ns2

Awesome-lists are a series of open source GitHub projects. They offer curated content around a specific topic that readers will find… awesome. Each list uses the “awesome-” naming convention and most of them give credit to other awesome lists that inspired them to create their own.\
They’ve become so popular that GitHub now displays “Awesome Lists” as one of the options in the mobile app Explore tab:\
You’ll find awesome-lists ranging from mainstream tech topics like awesome-react to random stuff like awesome-falsehoods (”a curated  list of falsehoods programmers believe in.”), awesome-board -games (“a curated list of awesome and exceptional board games”) and awesome-veganism  (“a curated list of awesome resources, pointers, and tips to make veganism easy and accessible to everyone”).My Progress From Consumer → MaintainerFor me, awesome-lists were love at first site when I was introduced to the concept a few years ago. I’m now a maintainer of my very own list, having recently started awesome-opensearch together with my friends at Pulse.\
👉 👉  ⭐ ? I’d really appreciate it! 🙏 🙏Researching the Origins of awesome-listsAll of this got me thinking - where did this awesome-list concept come from in the first place? Who started it? Did they do anything to promote the idea early on? And why “awesome” of all possible superlatives?\
I couldn’t find anyone who has written about this, so I decided to fill the gap myself. \
It’s helpful that GitHub is built to leave digital fingerprints and clues, and so after sifting through lot of commit histories, READMEs and PR comments I’ve pieced together the first timeline and history of awesome-lists.\
The first awesome-list in history was awesome-php, launched January 25, 2012 by Jamie York (@ziadoz on GitHub). Here's some awesome PHP libraries that are awesome. Yes, so awesome I've used the word three times! You should be using them already:
\
Two years later, on January 17, 2014 another awesome-list came to life when **Jan Van Ryswyck launched awesome-talks. And while this project carried a similar naming convention to awesome-php, Jack didn’t make any connection in his initial commits.**The first signal of influence and attribution would come a month later, on February 10, 2014 with the launch of awesome-sysadmin. In the initial commit, Francisco Augusto wrote:A curated list of amazingly awesome sysadmin open source resources inspired by Awesome PHP.
A curated list of amazingly awesome sysadmin open source resources inspired by [Awesome PHP](https://gist.github.com/Xanza/7663627)
\
Notice that the reference is a  URL. Gist is a GitHub feature that lets you store and distribute code snippets without setting up a full-fledged repository. It’s sort of like GitHub’s version of a post or a tweet.\
It turns out that the specific Gist reference that Francisco added is a dead link. Looks like he meant to reference: https://gist.github.com/ziadoz/1677679 which is where Jamie York had posted awesome-php back in January of 2012.It seems then, that the initial awesome-lists were not actually repositories - they were Gists. And the initial traction and visibility of the awesome-list concept was thanks to the social and sharing nature of the Gists feature.\
After almost 2 years on Gists, awesome-php had reached 260 forks and 1400 stars. And on Nov 29, 2013, Francisco announced that "Awesome PHP has been relocated permanently to its own Github repository](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php). No further updates will made to this gist".\
Awesome-lists had outgrown Gists and it was time to finally find their permanent home as stand-alone projects in GitHub proper.The real inflection point for awesome-list growth was the summer of 2014 as several new awesome-list GitHub projects were launched during June and July.A curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries and resources. Inspired by awesome-php.
\
On July 3rd, Marc Anguera launched awesome-ruby. There was no reference to other lists in the initial commit, but the timing and naming convention suggest that this was inspired by other awesome-lists that preceded it.Awesome-lists were also starting to gain wider promotion on other social platforms. Take this tweet for example on July 9th 2014 telling people about the awesome-ruby project:The rapid growth signals continued a couple of days later on July 6, 2014 when @avelino launched awesome-go. The initial commit reads:A curated list of awesome Go frameworks, libraries and software. Inspired by awesome-python.
\
Whereas other awesome-lists had referenced  as their OG awesome inspiration, awesome-go had taken inspiration from the  project that was launched just a week prior.\
The next day (July 7th) awesome-shell was launched by Caleb Xu. People throughout the GitHub ecosystem had apparently took notice of the awesome-list trend and they were joining with lists of their own.Awesome-lists Filled With awesome-listsBy July 8th, there were enough awesome-lists out there with enough exposure to inspire the first awesome-list of other awesome-lists.A curated list of amazingly awesome awesomeness
\
The list collected all of the above awesome-lists that came before it in one convenient place.A curated list of awesome tools, resources and workflow tips making an awesome development environment.

Inspired by [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go), which was in turn inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).
“A curated list of awesome lists.”
\
Jun 22, 2013, a year before the explosive growth of 2014. The frontend-dev-bookmarks project obviously did not use the awesome- naming convention and it’s not clear that it was inspired by the budding awesome-list trend. It appears that this was a parallel, similar effort to curate useful information, as Tim suggests in the initial commit:A badass list of frontend development resources I collected over time. Pull requests are welcome.
\
The pull of the awesome-list ecosystem was so strong, that even parallel efforts such as this one were pulled in.A curated list of delightful Node.js [packages](#packages) and [resources](#resources). 
Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list thing.
\
Awesome-lists had arrived at scale. \
They were officially “thing”.What Caused the Wild Summer of 2014?I reached out to several of these early awesome-list creators to understand what prompted the rapid growth during that summer of 2014. I assumed there must of been an event or conference that put the awesome-list concept on display to the entire dev community, but it turns out that it was completely organic. This was a trend that caught on thanks to social media sharing and algorithms.Balancing Scale and QualityOne of the interesting corollaries of awesome-list adoption was the challenge in maintaining them. How does one ensure that the links are correct? How do you identify links that become broken over time?\
This was something that the early adopters thought about, with Dotan of awesome-devenv sharing an article at the end of 2015 explaining how he used Travis CI to automatically review and validate awesome list content.As we referenced at the beginning of this article, Jamie York used the word “awesome” to describe the very first awesome-list: “Here's some awesome PHP libraries that are awesome. Yes, so awesome I've used the word three times! You should be using them already:”\
Awesome was used as an emotional measure of how delightful a resource of piece of content was. If it wasn’t delightful, then it didn’t belong on the list. The word “awesome” captured the ethos of the awesome-list movement and solidified the key distinction between  and . The objective was to curate only the best content, and leave the other stuff out.\
[Make sure the list] only has awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.The rest, as they say, is history. Awesome lists are here to stay as an important part of GitHub culture. Collectively, these projects have gained millions of GitHub stars and they hav proven to be a valuable set of resources for the dev community and beyond.\
The prolific growth of the awesome-list trend highlights the value of thoughtful content curation, and emphasizes the collaborative nature of open source.\
If you go this far and have an extra 8 seconds to spare, I’d appreciate it if you would give awesome-opensearch a star! ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What version of Go did this feature come in?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1i54h8p/what_version_of_go_did_this_feature_come_in/</link><author>/u/lickety-split1800</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 17:58:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It had been a while since I had coded in Go, and I noticed that interface{} or any can be used in comparisons without type assertions.

And the trend is rising. The German harvest can‘t meet this demand and that’s why many berries are imported. From places where their cultivation is bad news for both people and for nature itself.

Southern Portugal is a booming region for berry production in Europe. The country’s cultivation zone has increased fivefold in recent years - to almost 5,000 hectares. One of the producers: Logofruits. The Portuguese company grows blueberries on its plantation in Odemira on 75 hectares of land. For the owner, Lourenço de Botton, the biggest challenge is finding enough workers for the harvest season. Blueberries have to be picked by hand, a labor-intensive process that requires Logofruits to employ around 600 workers per day. Many of those toiling in the orchards in the Alentejo region come from Nepal, India or Bangladesh.

Odemira’s mayor Hélder Guerreiro explains that almost 11,000 migrant workers from over 80 countries now live here. This corresponds to around 40 per cent of the municipality's population. Although on the one hand it’s a great opportunity for the region, which has struggled with emigration in the past, it also presents a huge social challenge. Another problem, according to Guerreiro, is intensive farming’s huge demand for water.

One thing’s for sure: a growing appetite for berries in Germany has consequences for the countries where they are grown. Blueberries and raspberries also grow in Germany, but not all year round. In summer, supermarkets should be full of regional fruit. But they’re not. Even during the domestic season, more and more produce from abroad can be found on the fresh produce shelves. What does this mean for German berry producers?

Erik Appel from Darmstadt grows raspberries, among other things. However, berries cultivated in Germany are completely different to those that have been shipped over long distances. These varieties have been bred to be particularly robust and long-lasting. When it comes to raspberries from the region for the local market, flavor is paramount. And in that respect, says Erik Appel, nothing beats local berries. In terms of labor costs however, it’s almost impossible to compete with imported goods. After all, Germany has one of the highest minimum wages in Europe. This is reflected in the price - imported goods are often cheaper than regional berries.

My name is Alena and QA Lead :)\
In this article, I would like to share my experience in automating REST APIs using tools such as Postman, Newman and Jenkins.Postman is a popular API client that allows you to test, share, create, collaborate, and document your API development process within a team. An important feature of Postman is the ability to write and run JavaScript-based tests for APIs. Postman offers built-in API integration tools for some continuous integration (CI) tools, such as Jenkins.==Creating Collections and Writing Autotests in Postman==First, you need to create a collection and populate it with requests. Once the collection is ready, you can start writing autotests. There are two ways to add JavaScript code:You can add a script that runs before sending a request to the server, which is done on the "Pre-Request Script" tab.Alternatively, you can add a script that executes after receiving a response from the server, which is done on the "Tests" tab.\
I typically use the "Tests" tab. After adding the code to the tab, it will be launched when the request is executed. The result of the launch will be available on the Test Results tab of the response from the server. Dynamic variables can be used in test scripts. You can add checks for data from the response and transfer the received values between requests.It is very convenient that Postman offers ready-made code snippets for standard tasks that can be edited to suit your needs to save time. Thus, this type of automation can be mastered by someone who knows only the basics of JavaScript.\
The first simple autotest is to verify that the request was successful, and we received the status code 200 (or any other code that we expect). It is most convenient to enable this test at the collection level so that all queries under it inherit this check:pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
   pm.response.to.have.status(200);
\
The following test example is a JSON schema check. Why is the JSON schema validation required? Because:We monitor API responses and ensure that the format we receive is the same as expected.We receive an alert whenever there is any critical change in the JSON response.For integration tests, it is useful to check the schema. It can be generated once from the service response in order to test all future versions of the service with it.  let schema = {
     "items": {
         "type": "boolean"
     }
  };

  pm.test("Схема корректна", () => {
     pm.response.to.have.jsonSchema(schema);
  });
\
  Thus, we already have two automated REST API checks. I won’t bore you with further autotest examples, as they can be found and studied in the documentation at, so let’s move on to the exciting part: integrating our collection with Jenkins.==Integrating Postman with Continuous Integration (CI) Build Systems==The first question that arises is how to link Postman and Jenkins. To accomplish this, you need to use the CLI (command-line interface). Newman, an application that allows you to run and test Postman collections directly from the command line, is used to convert the Postman collection into command-line language.\
Here is a simplified list of steps on how to proceed: and run it. For more details, refer to the Jenkins documentation at Jenkins.io.Install Node.js and Newman in Jenkins:Go to your Jenkins server and log in.Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" and install the NodeJS plugin.Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Global Tool Configuration" and select "Add NodeJS" in the NodeJS section.Enter a name for the Node.js installation.In the "Global npm packages" field, enter .Select "Save". Detailed instructions can be found here.Verify that npm (the package manager for JavaScript) is also installed by entering the following commands in the command line:Open the console and install Newman itself using the command:Save your collection of tests; you can either generate a URL for the tests (share) or save it as a file (export).Run the tests in the console with the following command: newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/...  # (replace with the actual URL)
If using a file, use the command with the directory of the collection file: newman run /Users/Postman/postman_collection.json
After running, the tests will execute in the console, and the results will be displayed:\
After running, the tests will execute in the console, and the results will be displayed.\
Next, you can execute Newman from Jenkins after each commit to test the correctness of the responses. It is advisable to prepare templates in Postman, such as placing the host address and other changing request parameters into variables, which can then be transferred from the Credentials plugin to Jenkins.To configure tasks, add a shell command that includes a Newman call. After that, Jenkins will run the tests. You can set the desired frequency by navigating to the build window → Configure → Build Triggers → Build periodically. Jenkins will then report whether the build was successful or unsuccessful.\
You can also set up email distribution to inform team members about the latest builds and their statuses. This allows for active monitoring of your API builds along with other API components. Additionally, there are many other configurations you can implement to make the collection more dynamic.In conclusion, I would like to outline the pros and cons of using this type of automation.Postman is intuitive and easy to use.It requires no complicated configuration.It supports various APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL).It integrates easily into CI/CD processes using Newman.Newman is user-friendly and ideal for those who frequently use Postman and seek extended functionality with minimal effort.These tools are very effective for adding automation to testing, especially in the initial stages.Constructing automated tests for large projects with numerous REST services can be challenging.The inability to reuse code may lead to excessive duplication, making maintenance difficult, particularly when the number of scripts exceeds 1,000.This approach may not be viable if many tasks are being executed within the CI system—such as ongoing builds, running autotests, managing internal dependencies, or deploying builds to an environment. In such cases, you would need to increase the number of machines running the autotests and configure each one from scratch, ensuring that nothing is overlooked.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is the Universe Capable of Thinking? According to Sabine Hossenfelder, Maybe</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/is-the-universe-capable-of-thinking-according-to-sabine-hossenfelder-maybe?source=rss</link><author>Laszlo Fazekas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:45:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A few days ago, a video by Sabine Hossenfelder was released on YouTube discussing whether the Universe is capable of thinking. For those unfamiliar with Sabine, she is a physicist and one of the best presenters on scientific topics. No fluff, no mysticism—just facts and physical principles. She has excellent material on quantum mechanics, for example, where she demonstrates that these phenomena aren’t mystical but rather peculiar and manageable through mathematics. That’s why it was surprising to see her (seemingly) dive into a topic that appears mystical, like the thinking Universe. Moreover, she claims that it’s possible.Of course, anyone who watches the video won’t be disappointed. True to her style, Sabine approaches the topic from the perspective of physics.\
The first question, of course, is how we define thinking or perhaps consciousness. These topics are still the subject of intense debate today, but most would likely agree that thinking involves some form of information processing. And if that’s the case, then information transmission must occur. This, however, can immediately be addressed using our current knowledge of physics. According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light. This imposes an upper limit on any thinking structure. If something is too large, the slow transmission of information would prevent it from being able to think—or it would do so incredibly slowly.\
Similarly, there is also a lower limit to thinking, as the smallest unit for storing information could be an elementary particle. Moreover, due to environmental noise, stable information storage requires structures much larger than atoms. This provides a good explanation for why humans—and thinking life in general—exist in the middle range of scales.\
Based on the above, we should immediately dismiss the idea of a thinking Universe, but in her video, Sabine points out that there are a few loopholes.\
One such loophole is that while the speed of light imposes a limit on motion through space, space itself is not necessarily homogeneous. Fans of science fiction might immediately think of wormholes—regions that connect two distant points in space. A wormhole shouldn’t be imagined as a tunnel with a specific length; rather, it’s simply a peculiar structure of space. If I travel left, it might take 10 light-years to reach the next star, but there could be a shorter path to the right that takes only 1 light-minute.\
We haven’t discovered any wormholes yet, but that doesn’t mean they can’t exist. It’s possible that the world around us is full of them, but they’re so small that we’re incapable of detecting them. Still, information might be able to travel through them. Perhaps the Universe’s nervous system weaves densely through our world, and we remain completely unaware of it.\
The other loophole is that the theory of relativity doesn’t actually rule out the existence of speeds greater than the speed of light. It merely states that if something moves slower than the speed of light, it cannot be accelerated to exceed it. However, it doesn’t exclude the possibility of particles that are inherently faster than light. These hypothetical particles are called tachyons. They travel faster than the speed of light and cannot be slowed down to below light speed.\
Nothing rules out the possibility that the Universe might possess a nervous system made up of tiny wormholes or some tachyon brain (which sounds much cooler than a positronic brain). Because of this, the laws of physics do not completely exclude the possibility that the Universe could think.\
Of course, the question remains whether such a tachyon-brained Universe could know anything about us. Even if the Universe does think, it’s unlikely that our existence matters to it in any way—or that the Universe’s thoughts would have any impact on us. So, for those searching for God, this is probably the wrong place to look. A thinking Universe doesn’t really align with the traditional concept of God. However, to ensure that even those who started reading this article for that reason aren’t disappointed, let’s delve into a further line of reasoning.\
Attention! Pseudo-science alert!Sabine started from the laws of physics and examined whether consciousness could emerge as a property. But what if consciousness is fundamental, and the laws of physics are emergent?\
The very first article I wrote on HackerNoon was about this exact topic. What if the Universe is actually a brain—a thinking structure suffering from massive dissociative identity disorder, imagining itself as billions of humans? The physical reality and the world around us would then be nothing more than an interface between individual consciousnesses. It’s impossible to rule out this possibility because any experiment we might conduct to disprove this theory would fail. Our consciousness would always generate a reality that aligns with the laws of physics as we expect them to. Yes, yes, I’m talking about the good old simulation hypothesis. For those interested in exploring this topic further, feel free to read the article I mentioned:\
One of the counterarguments against the simulation hypothesis is: "Okay, but who built the computer running the simulation?" The answer is very simple: there is no computer (like there is no spoon). Just as the currently accepted scientific perspective holds that the Universe emerged from nothing, a thinking structure—a "Brain Universe"—could similarly have emerged from nothing. In this Universe, it wasn’t galaxies and stars that formed over time, but thoughts and consciousnesses. I’ve also written a full article on this topic. If you’re interested, you can read it here: A Brief Introduction to The Boltzmann Brain Theory\
As we reach the end of this article, we still don’t have an answer to our question. We still don’t know whether the Universe thinks or not. However, I believe we’ve gained many new ideas—ones that perhaps even go beyond this question.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>So You Think You’re Smart?

Back to the Future: Revisiting Quantum Computing 25 years laterMore than 25 years ago, circa 1999, I authored an article on the future of quantum computing, which was published in the science section of a printed newspaper in Argentina.You can access the original article here (in Spanish) and view an automatic translation by following this link.My article was quite speculative back then.Quantum computing has gained significant traction and relevance in technology discussions today.TL;DR: I will explain quantum computing in five levels to different audiences.A quantum computer is like a super-smart magic box.These qubits can do more tricks than normal bits.Imagine you’re playing with a spinning top. A qubit is like a spinning top that can do many tricks all at the same time.These magic computers might one day help solve impossible 100000-piece puzzles.Picture you can play with special building blocks used in many places simultaneously.Quantum computers use something similar called qubits.Think about a magic coin that can be heads and tails at the same time!A qubit can be 0, 1, or both, like the coin spinning in the air. All at once.This lets quantum computers explore many possibilities simultaneously.Quantum computers are powerful because they can break secret codes like personal passwords.It's like having a super-powerful calculator that can solve really hard puzzles much faster than regular computers.Each qubit can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling massive parallel computation.You can think of Schrödinger's cat - a famous thought experiment where a cat can be alive and dead at the same time.Qubits work similarly by being in multiple states simultaneously.Quantum computers can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers breaking public and private keys in encrypted internet connections.This capability threatens traditional cryptography and blockchains that rely on factoring difficulty.Researchers also explore quantum computing’s implications in multiverse theories, as qubits seemingly compute across many realities.Recently, Google claimed a quantum computer achieved “quantum supremacy”, solving a problem classical computers couldn’t handle in a reasonable timeframe.A Nature study also highlighted new quantum materials to stabilize qubits.The weird part is that these particles might suggest that many different realities exist at the same time, like parallel universes in science fiction movies!Quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and interference.While classical bits are binary, qubits utilize quantum superposition to represent multiple states concurrently.Quantum entanglement ensures qubits remain interconnected, even over distance, enabling highly efficient algorithms.You can use quantum gates to manipulate qubits, enabling you to create quantum circuits to execute quantum algorithms.These advancements drive concerns about securing digital systems against quantum threats.Multiverse speculation arises because qubits in superposition might interact with other realities, as postulated in Hugh Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation.Quantum computing pushes the principles of quantum superposition, entanglement, and unitary evolution to process information.Qubits transcend classical logic gates by encoding information in a multidimensional Hilbert space, enabling an exponential state space.Algorithms like Shor’s algorithm decompose semiprime integers in polynomial time, undermining cryptosystems like RSA and ECC.Grover’s algorithm demonstrates quadratic optimization for search tasks, representing a pivotal class of quantum advantage.Interpretations of quantum mechanics underpinning these systems differ: The Copenhagen interpretation postulates wavefunction collapse during measurement.This fuels debates on quantum parallelism across multiversal states.Google’s demonstration of quantum supremacy leveraged a 54-qubit Sycamore processor to complete a sampling problem in 200 seconds, previously estimated to require 10,000 years on the world’s most powerful supercomputers.The Planck scale (10^-35 m) suggests a fundamental graininess to spacetime, potentially limiting quantum computational power.Nature reports underscore advancements in stabilizing qubits through topological quantum error correction and fault-tolerant designs, essential for practical quantum computation.Are you excited about the quantum future?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Node.js &apos;Type Stripping&apos; for TypeScript Now Enabled by Default</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/19/0335202/nodejs-type-stripping-for-typescript-now-enabled-by-default?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The JavaScript runtime Node.js can execute TypeScript (Microsoft's JavaScript-derived language with static typing). 
But now it can do it even better, explains Marco Ippolito of the Node.js steering committee:

In August 2024 Node.js introduced a new experimental feature, Type Stripping, aimed at addressing a longstanding challenge in the Node.js ecosystem: running TypeScript with no configuration. Enabled by default in Node.js v23.6.0, this feature is on its way to becoming stable. 


TypeScript has reached incredible levels of popularity and has been the most requested feature in all the latest Node.js surveys. Unlike other alternatives such as CoffeeScript or Flow, which never gained similar traction, TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern development. While it has been supported in Node.js for some time through loaders, they relied heavily on configuration and user libraries. This reliance led to inconsistencies between different loaders, making them difficult to use interchangeably. The developer experience suffered due to these inconsistencies and the extra setup required... The goal is to make development faster and simpler, eliminating the overhead of configuration while maintaining the flexibility that developers expect... 

TypeScript is not just a language, it also relies on a toolchain to implement its features. The primary tool for this purpose is tsc, the TypeScript compiler CLI... Type checking is tightly coupled to the implementation of tsc, as there is no formal specification for how the language's type system should behave. This lack of a specification means that the behavior of tsc is effectively the definition of TypeScript's type system. tsc does not follow semantic versioning, so even minor updates can introduce changes to type checking that may break existing code. Transpilation, on the other hand, is a more stable process. It involves converting TypeScript code into JavaScript by removing types, transforming certain syntax constructs, and optionally "downleveling" the JavaScript to allow modern syntax to execute on older JavaScript engines. Unlike type checking, transpilation is less likely to change in breaking ways across versions of tsc. The likelihood of breaking changes is further reduced when we only consider the minimum transpilation needed to make the TypeScript code executable — and exclude downleveling of new JavaScript features not yet available in the JavaScript engine but available in TypeScript... 

Node.js, before enabling it by default, introduced --experimental-strip-types. This mode allows running TypeScript files by simply stripping inline types without performing type checking or any other code transformation. This minimal technique is known as Type Stripping. By excluding type checking and traditional transpilation, the more unstable aspects of TypeScript, Node.js reduces the risk of instability and mostly sidesteps the need to track minor TypeScript updates. Moreover, this solution does not require any configuration in order to execute code... Node.js eliminates the need for source maps by replacing the removed syntax with blank spaces, ensuring that the original locations of the code and structure remain intact. It is transparent — the code that runs is the code the author wrote, minus the types... 

"As this experimental feature evolves, the Node.js team will continue collaborating with the TypeScript team and the community to refine its behavior and reduce friction. You can check the roadmap for practical next steps..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fighting stops as Gaza ceasefire deal takes effect after delay | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4MXtt9Ckv0</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:33:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fighting in the Gaza Strip halted as a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas took effect after a brief delay, pausing a 15-month-old war.

I did not expect events to validate my perspective quite so dramatically or quickly. The reliance on undersea submarine cables, once the backbone of global connectivity, appears increasingly antiquated in light of recent technological breakthroughs.\
The theoretical discussion of satellite internet supremacy transformed into practical reality when SpaceX made a ground-breaking announcement. As reported by PCMag on January 3rd, "Each V3 Starlink satellite will have 1 Tbps of downlink speeds and 160 Gbps of uplink capacity, which is more than 10x the downlink and 24x the uplink capacity of the V2 Mini Starlink satellites." This isn't just an improvement, it's a complete re-imagining of global connectivity's future.\
This development has profound implications for Spacecoin's blockchain-powered satellite network. The convergence of high-bandwidth satellite technology and blockchain governance could create something entirely new: a system that's both incredibly powerful and truly democratic. While traditional infrastructure providers risk becoming centralized authorities in our digital age, the combination of Starlink's proven satellite capabilities and Spacecoin's blockchain governance model offers an alternative path.\
For the Pacific Islands, where I live and work, this evolution represents an unprecedented opportunity. Our region has long struggled with the limitations and vulnerabilities of traditional infrastructure, particularly during natural disasters when communication systems are most crucial. Rather than playing catch-up, we could pioneer the adoption of this new paradigm, leveraging satellite networks that provide both resilience and transformation.\
The implications extend far beyond basic internet access. When each node in a blockchain network can process and transmit data at terabyte speeds while maintaining security and transparency, we're looking at a fundamental shift in how human beings connect and interact. This isn't about replacing one technology with another, it's about the transformation of the very nature of global connectivity.\
The potential for collaboration between Starlink and Spacecoin particularly intrigues me. These aren't competing visions so much as complementary approaches to solving humanity's connectivity challenges. Such a partnership could ensure that satellite providers enhance rather than restrict digital democracy.\
Yesterday while we were out on the beach with my family, as I watched the sun set over the Pacific Ocean, I can imagine a cargo ship passes through the horizon, likely carrying materials for yet another undersea cable repair. I can't help but smile at the irony. The future of connectivity isn't buried beneath these vast waters but soaring high above them, in a network of satellites governed by the very people it serves. For those of us in the Pacific, and indeed for people everywhere who have struggled with digital isolation, this evolution couldn't come soon enough.\
The most exciting part? We're just at the beginning. As these technologies mature and converge, we're not just solving today's connectivity challenges, we're laying the foundation for tomorrow's world. And from where I sat on the sand at the beach, watching the stars begin to appear over the Pacific, that future looks brighter than ever.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How much do people trust this ceasefire? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Un3ny3r6U</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:22:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians in Gaza are returning to what's left of their homes.

As input we have something like Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:07:07 in UTC, and we’d like to turn this into 1737094027, the notional (but not actual) number of seconds that have passed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.Trying to figure this out led me to discover many ‘surprise features’ and otherwise unexpected behaviour of POSIX time handling functions as implemented in various C libraries & the languages that build on them. There are many good things in the world of C and UNIX, but time handling is not one of them.There is a narrow path of useful behaviour however. But first some context.The tl;dr: as long as you never call, you can use  to parse a UTC time string. Do not use %z or %Z. Pass the  calculated by  to the pre-standard function  ( on Windows) to get the correct UNIX epoch timestamp for your UTC time string. Do read on for solutions for if you do use locales. C++ has better support, which could also help you from C.Time is difficult enough by itself, even if we ignore leap seconds and general relativity. When we add human behaviour and politics, it all becomes exceptionally challenging. Timestamps as used by human beings range from impossible to imprecise.For example in Amsterdam, “the 30th of March 2025, 02:20” does not exist as a time:$ TZ=Europe/Amsterdam date -d '20250330 01:59:59'
Sun Mar 30 01:59:59 AM CET 2025
$ TZ=Europe/Amsterdam date -d '20250330 02:30:00'
date: invalid date ‘20250330 02:30:00’
This at least is clear. Because of daylight saving time we go straight from 01:59:59 to 03:00:00. Our tooling rightfully refuses to parse “02:30:00” since that timestamp never exists in Amsterdam on that day.But “the 27th of October 2024, 02:30” is harder to interpret. The second after 02:59:59, it is 02:00:00 again. This means we have  points in time locals would call ‘02:00’. And here already we can see our tooling starting to make arbitrary choices:$ TZ=Europe/Amsterdam date -d '20241027 01:59:59' +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %s %z"
2024-10-27 01:59:59 1729987199 +0200
$ TZ=Europe/Amsterdam date -d '20241027 02:00:00' +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %s %z"
2024-10-27 02:00:00 1729990800 +0100
Apparently, when asked to interpret 02:00:00, my copy of GNU date picks the  time this happens. As far as I can tell, this is because I’m running the command in January. In April it would likely have picked the first 02:00:00 instance. Wild eh?The only useful way anyone should ever be specifying a point of time is of course as a number of seconds after or before a known ’epoch’. For POSIX/Unix this is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, for GPS this is 1980-01-06 00:00:00 UTC, for Galileo (‘EU GPS’) 21st of August 1999, 23:59:47 UTC, for BeiDou 2006-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. GPS, Galileo and BeiDou wisely ignore leap seconds, leaving these as things for human beings to worry about.But, our preference for the POSIX/Unix “time_t” is well founded. There is never any ambiguity, except during leap seconds, which might never happen again.However, human beings have a hard time parsing 1737214750, so we do need to convert to and from timestamps that include messy things like ‘months’. To this end, UNIX offered us , holding the ‘broken-down time’:The standards say that  contains  these fields. There could be more. Now, this struct is of course wildly overdetermined. Day of the week and day of the year follow from the rest, for example. The meanings of ,  and  are badly specified and also badly understood, and vary based on how the struct is used.Interestingly, the Soviet GLONASS satellite navigation system is not based on an epoch timestamp.  They took the  approach based on ‘Moscow wall clock time’, including leap seconds. This reportedly causes lots of problems. And they deserve them.One major role of  is as input to , which as  of its work turns a ‘broken-down time according to your local TZ’ into a UNIX epoch timestamp. However, it also does many other things!Note that at least the Linux glibc manpage for  is pretty vague. The IEEE Std 1003.1-2024 specification offers a lot more (discouraging) words.It is important to understand that  does absolutely nothing with  or . Its inputs are defined to exclusively be: , , , , , , and .  can be negative, which means that  should figure out if daylight saving time is active at the specified time.As noted, time is difficult. If you for example want to adjust a date by a week, you could add 604800 seconds to a  timestamp. However, if that adjustment crosses a daylight savings time boundary, your 2PM appointment might suddenly turn into a 1PM or 3PM appointment next week. Humans do not expect this. not only returns a , it also  the  you passed it. And, at least as of 2024 there are rules for how it should do so. This means that to get the date that a human being would identify as “the same time next week” you can take the current time, add 7 to , and call  again. Although you just created a date like ‘March 35’,  will fix that up for you.Now, if we do this, we find that it doesn’t work:Here in the Europe/Amsterdam timezone this prints:original:        Fri Mar 28 14:00:00 2025
mktime adjusted: Fri Apr  4 15:00:00 2025
What happened, why did our appointment shift by an hour?  is what happened.  may not be perfect, but it does force you to make up your mind. Is the time it is looking at daylight savings time or not? Or, at your choice, do you want  to take a stab at figuring that out for you? The latter option is what we initially chose by setting  to -1.When we then ran , it discovered we were initially not in daylight saving time, so it set  to 0. When we ran  for the second time, this DST setting remained in place, even though the new intended time  happen in DST. The fix is to reset  to -1 before the second call.Now,  will interpret whatever you pass it as “local time”. This in means you should set your timezone to UTC before calling  to process a UTC time. Changing the timezone for your whole application however might have side effects if you have other threads running. But, you could do that if you have no other threads.There is a non-standard/pre-standard function that is very widely available that makes the UTC situation a lot better. From IEEE Std 1003.1-2024: “A future version of this standard is expected to add a  function that is similar to , except that the tm structure pointed to by timeptr contains a broken-down time in Coordinated Universal Time”.When using  on local times, set  to -1, which is almost always what ‘human beings’ expect. There is a chance you randomly get back one of two instances of ‘02:30’ (or equivalent) during DST fall back.Make sure to zero the rest of  before filling it out, just to be sure.Be aware that  does surgery on your , and that this may have side effects. At least reset  before reuse.No matter what you do with  or ,  will use your current timezone. If you want it to interpret your  as UTC, you actually need to set the TZ environment variable to UTC. This will however mess with any other threads doing time operations.Just use  or  insteadBut, how do we get our time string into a ?Now, it would be lovely if we could feed Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:07:07 GMT into  and get a sensible  in return. The Linux glibc  manpage has some airy words about how the %z and %Z timezone format specifiers might or likely might not do something. You just can’t tell:“For reasons of symmetry, glibc tries to support for strptime() the same format characters as for strftime(3).  (In , the corresponding fields are parsed, but no field in tm is changed.)Now, our goal is to convert a UTC time string into a UNIX epoch timestamp. Many people justifiably harbor some expectations that  with %Z (to parse ‘GMT’) followed by  could make that happen.Above we learned however that  does not look at the  or  fields at all, so there really is nothing that  can achieve there, even if it did the right thing. Oh, and it also does not do the right thing.Because of this  has no more specified behaviour for ‘%z’, which was one day supposed to do something with “+0200” style offset identifiers, which would have been lovely. But you can’t count on ‘%z’ doing anything useful. Nasal demons might ensue.There is however some wording on , but it is very limited. If your locale is known to have a DST timezone identifier (‘CEST’) that is different from the regular time zone (‘CET’), and if ‘%Z’ sees any of these two, it will set  to the right value for you. Except possibly if you live in Ireland. In general, it is also not useful to try to parse a string like ‘EST’, as it has no well defined meaning anyhow, except perhaps locally.Luckily, because we discovered  above, we can just ignore %z and %Z as we don’t need them anyhow.Now, what I didn’t know is that unless they specifically ask for it, C and C++ programs will stick to the “C” locale, which effectively is American English. This means that out of the box all LC_TIME etc environment variables are ignored. For our purposes of parsing time strings found in data, this is usually great, since these are almost exclusively in English.However, if you are in a C or C++ program that  call , thus asking for a possibly non-C locale, suddenly your program might only work for Dutch time strings. And these are quite rare.Now, you might ponder changing the locale to “C” before calling  and then changing it back, but sadly  is not safe to call in multithreaded programs (except before launching threads). Also you might confuse the output of other threads even if this was safe.So in general, if you need to parse specific time strings and you want to use , do make sure your program is on the locale you expect it to be. And although  exists, in which you can specify the locale to use for formatting time, the equivalent  is not officially available.Alternatively, it is not that hard to parse a string like  and fill out a  and then let  do the actual hard work of calculating a UNIX epoch timestamp.C++ iostreams are not much loved, but they did have a better think about locales than C/POSIX did. In C++ you can set the locale per iostream. Here is a C++ helper that you can call from C if you want to parse arbitrary UTC time strings in programs that do set the locale:This incidentally also shows how to do error handling for , which will helpfully return -1, , if you ask it to look at 31st of December 1969 23:59. The trick is to employ  as a sentinel to see if anything was processed or not. This tells you there was no error.C++20 and beyond contain a luxurious timezone database. This is not yet available on all compilers, but luckily the pre-standardized version is available for standalone use. Sometimes we get lucky because someone sacrifices a few years of their life to give us some truly excellent code that we really don’t deserve, and Howard Hinnant clearly delivered.Here is a glorious example:This picks “the first Monday of May 2016, 9AM local time in New York”, and then seamlessly converts this to two other timezones:The New York meeting is 2016-05-02 09:00:00 EDT
The London   meeting is 2016-05-02 14:00:00 BST
The Sydney   meeting is 2016-05-02 23:00:00 AEST
Being truly luxurious, the tz library supports using not just your operating system’s time zone databases, which might lack crucial leap second detail, but can also source the IANA tzdb directly. This allows you to faithfully calculate the actual duration of a plane flight in 1978 that not only passed through a DST change, but also an actual leap second. I don’t swoon easily, but I’m swooning.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The HackerNoon Newsletter: Lumoz Unveils TEE+ZK Multi-Proof for On-chain AI Agent (1/19/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/1-19-2025-newsletter?source=rss</link><author>Noonification</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:05:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🪐 What’s happening in tech today, January 19, 2025?By @mexcmedia [ 4 Min read ] MEXC highlights key December 2024 crypto trends, from Bitcoins $100K milestone to Solanas transaction records, AI narratives, and NFT sales surge.

We presented , an interactive workspace that enables scientists to explore their previous sediment sampling history and decide where new sediment samples may yield the greatest scientific return. By visualizing samples in the context of the environment, bringing together multiple data types in a single interface, and providing capabilities to predict values in unsampled locations,  offers a new approach to visualizing 3D point samples in fieldwork-driven science.\
In the future, we envision adding enhanced data analysis capabilities such as supporting multiple levels of phylogenetic hierarchy as well as aggregating and visualizing hierarchical data in the . Additionally, we aim to integrate new and more sophisticated models for large-scale interpolation over several tens or hundreds of meters, based on new research enabled by . The design elements introduced by  could also extend beyond operator-driven deep ocean sampling into similar domains, including studying remote terrestrial ecosystems as well as interplanetary exploration missions. For example, as autonomous sampling scenarios led by an AI system become possible, we could leverage insights into how human operators work with a system like  to train future autonomous sampling systems.Funding for this work was provided by grants from the National Science Foundation including the STC Center For Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations and NSF-OCE 2048666 (to V.J.O.).

India is considered WhatsApp’s , with many Indians using WhatsApp as their  and hundreds of millions of monthly active users. Despite the app’s immense popularity in the market, it has faced significant regulatory challenges from the Indian government, with a Delhi High Court mandating traceability (resulting in the breaking of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption) in , followed by a five-year ban on sharing information collected from WhatsApp by India’s Competition Commission in .\
Despite these regulatory challenges, WhatsApp received approval from India’s National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in December 2024 to extend its UPI services through WhatsApp Pay to its entire Indian user base. The NPCI, which oversees the country's retail payments and settlement infrastructure, granted this permission, marking a significant expansion for WhatsApp Pay in its largest market.\
This ruling speaks to the importance of WhatsApp’s role in Indian digitalization but also highlights the increasing footprint, and therefore, a potentially Meta-branded super app, within India.The Indian digital payments landscapeIn , the NPCI introduced the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a real-time, instant payment system that facilitates both peer-to-peer and merchant transactions. UPI’s core strength in enabling intermediate funds transfers through a phone number or UPI ID, along with its ability to integrate with third-party applications, has made it the de-facto backbone of all digital payments in India. UPI is also playing a significant role in the implementation of India’s digital rupee central bank digital currency (CBDC), highlighting India’s appetite for digitalization.\
Popular e-payment applications in India today  Google Pay, Walmart-backed PhonePe, Paytm, CRED, and BharatPe, which all utilize UPI to facilitate transactions. Since their respective launches, all of these applications have integrated a variety of additional digital payment features, including offline transactions, utility bill payments,\
Before this decision, WhatsApp had been limited in onboarding UPI users for Whatsapp Pay, with an initial cap of 1 million users in  (later raised to 100 million users in ), which required WhatsApp Pay to take a phased approach to expand its UPI user base.\n Therefore, despite currently having a relatively small share of the payments market, the removal of the user cap for WhatsApp will enable significant market share capture by India’s top communication application, with the merging of both communications and payments services potentially establishing WhatsApp’s, and a Meta-developed super app’s, dominance in the digital Indian market. throughout the globe by WeChat and AliPay,  have played a big role in the digitization of Southeast Asian countries, with Singapore’s Grab, Indonesia’s GoJek, and South Korea’s KakaoTalk revolutionizing everything from ride-hailing to food delivery to digital payments, among many other services.\
Despite these positive trends elsewhere throughout the world, superapps in India have not received much success, with one prime case study being Tata Group’s Tata Neu, launched in , which has experienced exponentially declining interest due to many . This failure could be due to market saturation from entrenched players, lack of interest from local audiences, high market share capture costs, and/or a myriad of other factors.\
However, the removal of barriers against WhatsApp, combined with its existing popularity, especially when combined with capabilities offered by other Meta products, could help supercharge a Meta-built platform to superapp status in India.The Indian social media market is already  by Meta products such as Facebook and WhatsApp, with Indians being the  behind Meta-owned platform downloads. As a result, Meta’s foothold in India remains strong, giving rise to the potential of a Meta-built application with WhatsApp integration being India’s first undisputed superapp.\
Meta is deeply entrenched in India in both private and public contexts. On the private front, Meta announced an expansion of its business subscription program to Indian users in , followed by an  announcement of a Meta partnership focusing on generative artificial intelligence (AI) with global conglomerate Infosys. One recent public sector partnership included the  announcement of Meta to work with the Telangana government to provide Indians with emerging technologies such as AI to enhance e-governance and citizen services. Another recent public partnership included the  announcement to partner with India’s Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) to integrate AI and VR into Skill India to increase and incubate talent Indian talent.While an independently-created Meta-developed superapp, or even enhancements on WhatsApp, may seem far-fetched to some, the fact remains that Meta controls India’s most popular communication and social media platforms. The removal of restrictions on onboarding users to digital payments for one of those platforms, WhatsApp, highlights an immense opportunity for Meta to develop India’s first widely-adopted super-app.\
However, regardless of whether a Meta-built superapp is in development or not, it is clear that WhatsApp has and will continue to play an important role in Indian digitalization, whether through its status as India’s #1 communication platform or as a growing digital payments application.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GameGPT Launches Genesis AI NFT Collection, Combining AI And Blockchain For The Future Of Gaming</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/gamegpt-launches-genesis-ai-nft-collection-combining-ai-and-blockchain-for-the-future-of-gaming?source=rss</link><author>Chainwire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:52:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AUSTIN, United States / Texas, January 18th, 2025/Chainwire/--Bringing cutting-edge AI technology to the forefront of gaming and blockchain, GameGPT announces the official launch of their Genesis AI NFT Collection—an innovative blend of digital NFT ownership and advanced AI Agent capability.\

It will be an internal ACME server on our local network (ACME is the same protocol used by Let's Encrypt). The YubiKey will securely store the CA private keys and sign certificates, acting as a cheap alternative to a Hardware Security Module (HSM). We'll also use an open-source True Random Number Generator, called Infinite Noise TRNG, to spice up the Linux entropy pool.Why would I want a Certificate Authority in my homelab?!Because end-to-end TLS is great and you should easily be able to run TLS wherever you need it. Especially in your homelab. Internal networks are no longer perceived as a safe zone where unencrypted traffic is okay. But you need certificates.Because the ACME protocol (used by Let's Encrypt) can easily be deployed internally, so you can automate renewal and never have to think about your certificates.Because maybe you've done the 'self-signed certificate' rigmarole with OpenSSL a dozen times already. Might as well formalize things and get your devices to trust a CA that you can use wherever you need it.Because setting up a simple CA is a great learning experience.Basic OS & Networking SetupFire up the Raspberry Pi, plug it into your network, and find its initial IP address.
You can run arp -na | grep -e "b8:27:eb" -e "dc:a6:32" -e "e4:5f:01" to discover Raspberry Pi devices on the local network.Login via SSH (username and password will be ), and change the password.Set the hostname via hostnamectl set-hostname tinycaSet the timezone using timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles (or whatever your timezone is; timedatectl list-timezones will list them all)Be sure NTP is working. Check status with — make sure "NTP Service" is "active". If not, you can add some NTP servers to /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf and run systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.You'll need the machine to have a DNS name (for me it's ) and/or a static IP on your network.Now that you have good time synchronization and a stable hostname, we can proceed.Install prerequisite: Now, insert your YubiKey. Let's install the  (and dependency ) and make sure you can connect to the YubiKey:$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y yubikey-manager
$ ykman info

Optional, but 🔥: Set up the outboard random number generatorInfinite Noise TRNG is an open-source USB True Random Number Generator. It uses a "modular entropy multiplier" architecture to generate a  of random data quickly. For this setup, a daemon will continuously feed entropy into Linux's system entropy pool by writing to .But will this lovely new entropy generator actually be used by the CA? I needed to answer two questions here:How does the CA generate random numbers? I had to dig around a little to confirm this.  uses Go's  for all of its key generation, and  uses  as its random data source on Linux systems.Does the entropy created via writing to  actually affects what is read from ? It does—because Linux has only one entropy pool, shared by  and .We also need to confirm that the outboard TRNG is actually generating high quality noise. We'll do that in a minute.
You'll need to compile the driver from source, because there's no pre-built  package available.$ curl -LO https://github.com/leetronics/infnoise/archive/refs/tags/0.3.3.tar.gz

Entropy is written to  by  every second. You're all set on randomness! Now that you have more than enough entropy, you're ready to generate your CA keys.Part 2: Creating Your PKINow you'll create your root and intermediate CA certificates and keys, and store them securely on the YubiKey.Ideally, your Raspberry Pi should be kept offline for this section. Disconnect the Ethernet cable, and connect directly to the device via HDMI and a keyboard.Prepare a USB thumb drive for storing the private keysYou can't just have your CA private keys live  on the YubiKey. You'll want at least one backup of them, in case the YubiKey breaks!Insert a USB thumb drive. You'll generate the keys directly on this drive, so that they never touch the Pi's microSD card. First, find the device name of your USB drive:$ sudo fdisk -l
...

Generate your PKI on the thumb driveGreat, now you're ready to create your Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Specifically, you'll be creating CA keys and certificates.Tiny CA has a root CA key and certificate, and an intermediate CA key and certificate.The root CA key signs the Intermediate CA certificate.The root CA certificate is self-signed (signed with the root CA key)The intermediate CA key will sign all of your TLS certificates.By default,  issues certificates with a 24-hour lifetime. I hope this default will compel you to set up automated renewal on your clients. And you can always increase the TLS certificate duration in the CA configuration, if you want something a bit more relaxed.If a device is configured to trust your root CA, it will trust certificates you create with .You can throw away the root CA key if you never need another intermediate.$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
$ cd /mnt
$ sudo mkdir ca
$ sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu ca
$ export STEPPATH=/mnt/ca

OK! Now you'll copy out the CA certificate files, leave the private keys on the USB stick, and continue creating your CA.$ sudo cp /mnt/ca/certs/intermediate_ca.crt /mnt/ca/certs/root_ca.crt /root
$ cd
$ sudo umount /mnt
Finally, reconnect your CA to your local network to continue the setup.Part 3: Configuring Your CAYou're going to re-run  now, but you're not going to use the certificates or keys that it generates.
You're just doing this to create the configuration files.
The password you choose when prompted will be your admin provisioner password.
Anyone with this password will be able to administer your CA and get any certificate from it,
using the  subcommand.Don't use your root CA password for your provisioner,
but pick something strong and store it somewhere safe.$ sudo useradd step
$ sudo passwd -l step
$ sudo mkdir /etc/step-ca

Next, you'll need to configure  to use your YubiKey to sign certificates, using the intermediate key on the YubiKey. Notice that the default YubiKey PIN () is shown here, too.You should change your YubiKey PIN, PUK, and management key if you haven't already! Learn how in this guide.
Now edit the file /etc/step-ca/config/ca.json. You'll want the top of the file to look like this:

Great! You just signed your first X.509 TLS leaf certificate using the YubiKey and .When you ask the CA to issue a leaf certificate for a TLS endpoint, you'll get a certificate file and a (locally-generated) private key file.  The certificate file will contain both the intermediate CA certificate and the leaf certificate you requested. This way, a device which trusts your root CA can verify the chain of trust from the root to the intermediate, and from the intermediate to the leaf.Finally, you'll add an ACME provisioner, which will turn your Tiny CA into a tiny Let's Encrypt!$ step ca provisioner add acme --type acme --admin-name step

You'll also configure systemd to stop the CA when the YubiKey is removed, and restart it when the YubiKey is reinserted.

You did it! Your CA is up and running.Bootstrapping a new device into your PKIWhen you run  (as above) on a new device,
the root certificate  is downloaded from the CA.
If you run step ca bootstrap --install --ca-url=https://your.ca --fingerprint=your-ca-fingerprint,
it will install the root certificate into your device's trust store.You can also use the  command for easy installation of your root CA certificate (),
for ACME enrollment (step ca certificate example.com example.crt example.key --provisioner acme)
and for renewal of any certificate that hasn't yet expired (step ca renew example.crt example.key).For mobile devices, you can usually install a certificate by sending it to yourself via Bluetooth or AirDrop, or as an email attachment. Make sure the certificate isn't just installed, but actually trusted by the device. This usually involves a couple of confirmation steps on the device.Automating certificate renewalBecause certificates from your CA have a 24-hour lifetime, you'll want to renew them every 16ish hours.
Our renewal documentation has a few options
for setting up renewal on your clients.Now that you have an internal CA, here's a few useful resources:Hello mTLS shows you how to get mutual TLS authentication configured for several common services and programming languages, using the  command.There's also a lot to learn about the different provisioners you can add to your CA to suit your workflows.
See Configuring .Bonus: Want to use SSH certificates?
You can turn your tiny CA into an SSH CA, and use certificates and single sign-on for your SSH hosts.

"Together with the open source community, we've continued to build this tool, adding remediation features," according to Google's security blog, "as well as expanding ecosystem support to 11 programming languages and 20 package manager formats... Users looking for an out-of-the-box vulnerability scanning CLI tool should check out OSV-Scanner, which already provides comprehensive language package scanning capabilities..." 

Thursday they also announced an extensible library for "software composition analysis" scanning (as well as file-system scanning) named OSV-SCALIBR (Open Source Vulnerability — Software Composition Analysis LIBRary). The new library "combines Google's internal vulnerability management expertise into one scanning library with significant new capabilities such as:

 Software composition analysis for installed packages, standalone binaries, as well as source code 
 OSes package scanning on Linux (COS, Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, and much more), Windows, and Mac 
 Artifact and lockfile scanning in major language ecosystems (Go, Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby, and much more) 
 Vulnerability scanning tools such as weak credential detectors for Linux, Windows, and Mac 
 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation in SPDX and CycloneDX, the two most popular document formats 
 Optimization for on-host scanning of resource constrained environments where performance and low resource consumption is critical


"OSV-SCALIBR is now the primary software composition analysis engine used within Google for live hosts, code repos, and containers. It's been used and tested extensively across many different products and internal tools to help generate SBOMs, find vulnerabilities, and help protect our users' data at Google scale. We offer OSV-SCALIBR primarily as an open source Go library today, and we're working on adding its new capabilities into OSV-Scanner as the primary CLI interface."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada threatens ‘single largest trade blow’ to U.S. if Trump follows through on tariffs</title><link>https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/canada-threatens-single-largest-trade-blow-to-us-if-trump-follows-through-on-tariffs/</link><author>/u/Coolsam2000</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:33:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Published: January 19, 2025 at 5:00AM EST]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to Boost App Downloads with AI-Powered Promo Videos</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-to-boost-app-downloads-with-ai-powered-promo-videos?source=rss</link><author>MarGrowth</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:23:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\

Think of it as a smarter copy-paste tool! It works with public/private repos or local directories as template sources.Currently, there’s just one official style available, but the vision is to add more to cover most (and even some uncommon) use cases—like a Go microservice, a React front-end, or a full-stack project with CI/CD baked in.I created Waku because I got tired of setting up projects from scratch over and over. The goal is to make project setup painless, so you can skip the boring boilerplate and get straight to coding.I’ve been using Waku myself and iterating on it for over half a year now, and so far, the feedback from developers has been pretty positive.It’s still early days (), but that’s the vision for Waku moving forward.Would love your to hear your thoughts, ideas, or contributions!

ABSTRACT
Programming #GenerativeArt, also known as #CreativeCoding, is often a trial-and-error process, combining creativity and logic to present something aesthetic. However, creative coding has a high barrier to entry due to the breadth of knowledge and coding skills required. This talk aims to lower that barrier for you to take home and practice creative coding.

In this talk, you will learn about #algorithms and techniques for generative art using a pure #FunctionalParadigm. First, shepherding random numbers to simulate the universality of nature patterns that appear in plants, rocks, sand, and smoke. Next, using L-system formal grammar to create a seemingly infinite, but well-structured, series of graphics. Lastly, interfacing with printers to bring your drawing to life.

For you to get the most out of this talk, you should be comfortable working in a functional language of your choice. Although I will introduce some theory, background in mathematics and formal theory is not required to attend.

Once you get used to Lisp, you stop noticing the parentheses and rely on indentation instead.
That's partially why there are several alternative syntaxes based solely on indentation.
Like Wisp,
or sweet expressions.
But then, the question stands: how to indent the code, actually?
Especially so—in Lispy syntax.


A solution that will likely satisfy a proponent of any indentation style:
"Just put it all on one line lol."
Of course, lines are not infinitely readable and there's a column cap,
(whether natural or enforced.)
So this line (adapted from
cl-blc,)
while devoid of indentation problems, is unreadable:

(list (tree-transform-if predicate transformer (first tree) depth) (tree-transform-if predicate transformer (second tree) depth))
Absurdly long line of a Lisp code
That's the problem statement: some forms need multiple lines and indentation.
But what kind of indentation?


There's an established style of indentation: align the function arguments on the same column:

(list (tree-transform-if predicate transformer (first tree) depth)
      (tree-transform-if predicate transformer (second tree) depth))
(inc! d (/ (* (mtx:get x i k)
              (mtx:get x j k))
           (1+ (* (vec:get dl l)
                  (vec:get eval k)))))
(let ((s (if (< j i) j i))
      (l (if (< j i) i j)))
  (+ (* s 1/2 (- (* 2 d-size) (1+ s)))
     l
     (- s)))
Examples of function-like indentation
This style if useful in reflecting the code structure: just look at what's indented and what's outdented.
It works especially well for short function/macro/form names, like  or .
Not so well for long ones:

(tree-transform-if predicate
                   transformer
                   (second tree)
                   depth)
A problematic function indentation
Nineteen!
Nineteen spaces of indentation!
It's getting unruly.
Such an indent, when used in deeply nested code, makes it too wide and unreadable.
If you add the strict one-per-line alignment of arguments, it's also painfully long line-wise.
Let's handle the verticality first:


No sane Lisper would write a  with every keyword on its own line:

(loop for
      i
      below
      10
      collect
      i)

(Some pretty-printers do that too (I'm looking at you, ECL!), but that's a topic for another day.)


We don't have to put every argument on its own line.
That's the intuition behind the space-filling indent:

(loop for i below 10
      collect i)

One can go as far as splitting the argument list in arbitrary places.
Regardless of semantics.
(Looking at you, SBCL!)
Putting some keyword arguments on the first line, and then some on the second/third/etc.
This utilizes the space efficiently enough to be used.
But what if one's stuck really deep in nesting levels?


Now what I'm about to suggest is likely not to your taste:

(tree-transform-if
 predicate transformer (second tree) depth)
My indentation style suited for deeply nested code
This style of indentation
(putting function name on one line, and arguments on the other)
was frowned upon more than once in my practice:

 It messes up with nesting identification: one space is not enough.
 It makes the code too vertical.
 And it certainly isn't idiomatic.

But what this style achieves is perfect indentation control.
You only get one space of indentation per form.
Complex algorithms are easier to read when written in this style.


And!
This style also plays well with most indentation tools, even the simplest ones.
I had this situation more than once:

 Writing a  macro in Scheme;
 And realizing that Emacs/Geiser indentation functions think that this macro is a procedure.

Indenting all the arguments of the /-like macro in this sick style helps:

;; From
(mtx:with-column (uab-col uab index-ab)
                 (mtx:set!
                  ppab 0 index-ab
                  (blas:dot hi-hi-eval uab-col)))
;; To
(mtx:with-column
 (uab-col uab index-ab)
 (mtx:set!
  ppab 0 index-ab
  (blas:dot hi-hi-eval uab-col)))
Sick indent helps you to manage macros
I worked on a deeply nested corporate codebase functions.
In Clojure.
And I realized why threading macros exist.
To make the logic more sequential and readable, true.
But also to tame excessive nesting!


Unfortunately, threading/arrow macros don't always work.
Common Lisp in particular is extremely unfriendly to threading macros.
Arrows imply a consistent thread-first or thread-last functions.
But CL's standard lib is too inconsistent for that to work.
So we're left with picking an indentation style we don't necessarily like.


I often prefer the macro-like indentation, because I sometimes write deeply nested code.
But I see the value in all the other indentation schemes!

And when someone posted Fortune's article to Reddit's antiwork subreddit, it drew 2,100 upvotes -- and another 84 comments. ("I love doing this...! This feels really great to do after a company has jerked you around, and basically said that several other people were in line ahead of you... after five interviews.") 

But Fortune reports there's other sources of frustration:

At the moment, Gen Z is contending with an onerous battle to land an entry-level, full-time role. The class of 2025 is set to apply to more jobs than the graduating class prior, already submitting 24% more applications on average this past summer than seniors did last year. Furthermore, the class of 2024 applied to 64% more jobs than the cohort before them, according to job platform Handshake. To make matters all the more bleak, the number of job listings has dwindled from 2023 levels, generating deeper frenzy and more intense competition for the roles listed. 


That adds up to a hiring managers' market and senior executives are playing hardball; only 12% of mid-level executives think entry-level workers are prepared to join the workforce, per a report from technology education provider General Assembly. About one in four say they wouldn't hire today's entry-level employees. Yet, that's not really the point of entry-level roles, points out Jourdan Hathaway, General Assembly's chief business officer. By definition, it's a position that requires investment in a young adult, she explained. "The entry-level employee pipeline is broken," Hathaway wrote in a statement. "Companies must rethink how they source, train, and onboard employees." 

The especially competitive hiring landscape could be forcing Gen Zers to accept the first gig they can get because the job market is so dire — only to later regret it and not show up the first day. 

The article also acknowledges that "employers themselves have a role in the two-way communication — or lack thereof — between hire and hirer."

Almost 80% of hiring managers admitted they've stopped responding to candidates during the application process, according to a survey of 625 hiring managers from Resume Genius. 

Gen Zers say that their ghosting is in reaction to the company's behavior. More than a third of applicants who have purposefully dropped the ball say it was because a recruiter was rude to them or misled them about a position, according to Monster... In part, it's likely AI that's fueling said ghosting. AI has become more integrated into the hiring process, becoming a screener that rejects resumes without ever reaching a human person's eyes. That phenomenon possibly fuels both sides' tendency to be non-responsive...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump&apos;s hints at 90-day reprieve for TikTok: What does it mean? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFkzgkfXjzk</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 12:30:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TikTok has stopped working for users in the United States.

         — 
    
            Hundreds of supporters of South Korea’s arrested president, Yoon Suk Yeol, stormed a court building early on Sunday after his detention was extended, smashing windows and breaking inside, an attack the country’s acting leader called “unimaginable.”
    
            Yoon on Wednesday became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested as he faces allegations of insurrection related to his stunning, short-lived December 3 declaration of martial law that has plunged the country into political turmoil.
    
            Shortly after the court’s decision was announced around 3 a.m. local time on Sunday, his supporters swarmed the building, overwhelming riot police trying to keep them at bay.
    
            Protesters blasted fire extinguishers at lines of police guarding the front entrance, then flooded inside, destroying office equipment, fittings and furniture, footage showed.
    
            Police restored order a few hours later, saying they had arrested 46 protesters and vowing to track down others involved.
    
            “The government expresses strong regret over the illegal violence… which is unimaginable in a democratic society,” acting President Choi Sang-mok said in a statement, adding that the authorities would step up safety measures around gatherings.
    
            Nine police officers were injured in the chaos, Yonhap news agency reported. Police were not immediately available for comment on the injured officers.
    
            About 40 people suffered minor injuries, said an emergency responder near the Seoul Western District Court.
    
            Several of those involved live-streamed the intrusion on YouTube, showing protesters trashing the court and chanting Yoon’s name. Some streamers were caught by police during their broadcasts.
    
            With Yoon refusing to be questioned, investigators facing a deadline on detaining the president asked the court on Friday to extend his custody.
    
            After a five-hour hearing on Saturday, which Yoon attended, a judge granted a new warrant extending Yoon’s detention for up to 20 days, due to “concern that the suspect may destroy evidence.”
    
            South Korean regulations require a suspect detained under a warrant to undergo a physical exam, have a mugshot taken and wear a prison uniform.
    
            The leader is being held in a solitary cell at the Seoul Detention Centre.
    
            The corruption investigation office leading the probe said it had called Yoon in for further questioning on Sunday afternoon, but the prosecutor-turned-president has so far stonewalled their efforts to interrogate him.
    
            His lawyers have argued the arrest is illegal because the warrant was issued in the wrong jurisdiction and the investigating team had no mandate for their probe.
    
            Insurrection, the crime that Yoon may be charged with, is one of the few that a South Korean president does not have immunity from and is technically punishable by death. South Korea, however, has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years.
    
            “President Yoon Suk Yeol and our legal team will never give up,” lawyers representing Yoon said in a statement.
    
            “We will do our best in all future judicial procedures to correct the wrong,” the lawyers said, adding that the violence at the court was an “unfortunate” incident.
    
            Separate to the criminal probe that sparked Sunday’s chaos, the Constitutional Court is deliberating whether to permanently remove him from office, in line with parliament’s Dec. 14 impeachment, or restore his presidential powers.
    
            Yoon’s conservative People Power Party called the court’s decision to extend his detention on Sunday a “great pity.”
    
            “There’s a question whether repercussions of detaining a sitting president were sufficiently considered,” the party said in a statement.
    
            The main opposition Democratic Party called the court’s approval on the warrant a “cornerstone” for rebuilding order and said that “riots” by “far-right” groups would only deepen the national crisis.
    
            Support for the PPP collapsed after his martial law declaration, which he rescinded hours later in the face of a unanimous vote in parliament rejecting it.
    
            But in the turmoil since - in which the opposition-majority parliament also impeached his first replacement and investigators botched an initial attempt to arrest Yoon - the PPP’s support has sharply rebounded.
    
            His party has edged ahead of the opposition Democratic Party in support - 39% to 36% - for the first time since August, a Gallup Korea poll showed on Friday.
    
            Thousands gathered for an orderly rally in support of Yoon in downtown Seoul on Sunday morning. Anti-Yoon demonstrations have also taken place across the city in recent days.

As the political deputy at the Foreign Ministry, he stated there was no valid reason to deny education to females.The current Taliban administration has restricted female education beyond year six. Reports from September indicate that medical training and courses for women have also been halted, though authorities have not officially confirmed this restriction, AP news agency reported.The healthcare system in Afghanistan requires female medical professionals to treat women and girls. Stanikzai, speaking in a video posted on his official X account, emphasised that denying rights to half the population contradicts Islamic law and represents personal preferences rather than religious doctrine.Stanikzai, who previously led Taliban negotiations for foreign troop withdrawal, has advocated for women's education before. His recent statement, however, marks his first direct appeal to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada for policy change.Crisis Group analyst Ibraheem Bahiss noted that while Stanikzai has consistently supported girls' education, his latest statement more explicitly challenges current policies and their legitimacy.At a recent conference in Islamabad, Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders to confront the Taliban regarding female education. The UN maintains that international recognition remains unlikely while restrictions on women's education, employment and movement persist.Whilst no nation officially recognises the Taliban government, some countries are establishing diplomatic connections. Russia has strengthened its ties, and India continues to develop relations with Afghan authorities, as evidenced by the recent meeting in Dubai between Indian diplomat Vikram Mistri and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fragile ceasefire begins in Gaza after deadly 3-hour delay | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRd0QPQcMyw</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:02:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has begun in Gaza after a nearly three-hour delay.

I was thirteen and had just scored my first goal in a competitive football match - a lovely one-two with the winger finished by a powerful strike into the top left corner. Sadly the talent scouts were missing that day. Whilst I was dreaming of Wembley, Go was announced to the world.Go soon attracted a large following. People loved how simple it was, how optimised it was for web services and the tooling like . Every action has an equal and opposite reaction however, and so it was with Go. People hated how simple it was, how it was just for noddy REST APIs and the overzealous tooling.And so they didn't. They didn't design a language. It sorta just "happened".To me, a design is a plan or specification for something that fulfils a goal. For example, the goal of the BBC News website might be to inform users of the most relevant things that are going on in the world. The way they do that is by writing news articles, ordering them based on location and importance. The nuclear missile speeding towards me trumps the cat stuck up a tree.It follows that a design can be evaluated on how well it achieves the design goal.Go was designed at Google, where Russ Cox, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson and many others were working. Google was using Java and C++ at the time which the designers of Go felt were performant but hard to use. The compilers were slow, tooling was finicky and the languages had been designed at least a decade before. Cloud computing - large numbers of multicore servers working together - was becoming widespread.They decided to design their own language and prioritised making it work at scale - in computing and man power. Rob Pike explains in Go at Google:The hardware is big and the software is big. There are many millions of lines of software, with servers mostly in C++ and lots of Java and Python for the other pieces. Thousands of engineers work on the code.Elsewhere Pike talks about the thousands of engineers he was targeting, in his usual modest, subtle way:The key point here is our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language.Top tip: if you're designing something, try to avoid belittling and patronising the people you are designing for.Notwithstanding this quote, we get a pretty reasonable design goal: the language should make writing and maintaining large, concurrent server code easy; even across thousands of developers of differing skill levels.Let's look at some complaints people have about Go and evaluate them against the design goal.Go's filesystem API is often criticised for being geared towards Unix. Windows doesn't have file permissions in the way that Unix does, so Go just returns some made up ones. Furthermore Go takes a pretty simplistic approach to paths. An OS has a path separator and paths themselves are Go's  type - just a slice of bytes with no real checking or constraints.This can be explained by the design goal. Go was designed for use at Google where their servers are all Linux, like most servers. If you're designing a language that is aimed at servers, writing the filesystem API to be Unix-centric is not such a bad idea.No Operator or Function OverloadingIn Go, unlike Java, functions and methods only have one definition (once build tags and target are specified). Operators are implemented in the compiler, unlike C++, and so cannot be overloaded either.  In the  package, to add a  to a  you need to use the  method. If you want to add two days you can't just call Add(0 /*years*/, 0 /*months*/, 2 /*days*/), you need to use .To some this may seem inelegant but it is simpler. If you see a function call in Go you know there is one definition you need to check. If you see an operator you know it is for a built in type and will do something sensible, not mint an NFT.It's fair to say that the current trend in programming languages is towards terseness. No wonder programmers hate Go's  style of error handling.However, again, this was a deliberate choice:Although in contrast Go makes it more verbose to check errors, the explicit design keeps the flow of control straightforward—literally.Obvious control flow makes code more readable. Although languages with exceptions might be quicker to write, the code they produce is not as simple, and control flow is hidden.Go is often criticised for being a bit of a throw-back by avoiding features like exceptions. Someone once asked the designers "Why did you choose to ignore any research about type systems since the 1970s?". Similar arguments has been repeated elsewhere.Firstly Rob Pike sees your snootiness, and doesn't care about it:Go was designed to address the problems faced in software development at Google, which led to a language that is not a breakthrough research language but is nonetheless an excellent tool for engineering large software projects.But secondly designing errors as explicit values has been a trend-(re)setter. Go, Rust and Zig have all chosen to use this approach. Swift, even though it uses exceptions, requires you to mark functions that can error in their signature.Go doesn't play nicely with other languages. If you want to call a C function - for example to bind to SQLite - then you have to go through CGo. CGo is not Go and has a performance overhead. As goroutines - which have their own stack set up by the Go runtime - are the unit of execution, Go has to do some acrobatics to have the stack in the way C expects. This can be costly.Go's FFI is not helped by it having its own compiler, linker and debugger. Much in the Go ecosystem is custom.When we consider the design goal we can find justification. Server software has to be concurrent, and so goroutines were chosen. That necessarily makes calling C code more complicated, but the trade-off does at least fit with Go being used for concurrent systems where  talk to each other, not processes.These decisions also gave Go a leg-up on tooling. The compiler being specific to Go means it can focus on compiling just Go as quickly as possible. The debugger can understand goroutines and all of Go's built in types.That's subjective. For my part, I like it. The Go code I've looked at and worked on has generally been easy to read and understand. The lack of bells and whistles forces me to just write the damn code rather than building abstractions that don't hold their weight. I've also taught Go to a large group of graduates just out of university with success.That doesn't mean I don't see its downsides. I've been sat in a call with a customer who was affected by a bug that we couldn't trace due to not checking an error. Easily prevented by linters; painful when you haven't turned them on. For ages Go didn't have generics which made it annoying to write generic data structures. Every time I receive a bug report on Windows I have to pause to think about whether Go has lulled me into a false sense of security.Ultimately these are issues that have resulted from a trade-off that was deliberately made in the design process. You can say you don't like Go, or that it is a bad fit for a certain application, or it doesn't give you the things you need. Heck, you can even say you hate it. But don't say it wasn't (well) designed.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I wrote a DHCP Server in Go (personal project)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1i4vroz/i_wrote_a_dhcp_server_in_go_personal_project/</link><author>/u/umegbewe</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:38:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey everyone, i wanted to share a project i have been working on.

I don't know what to do. I feel frustrated and devastated."The initial exchange was to see three Israeli hostages released from captivity in return for a first group of Palestinian prisoners.A total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel will be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce.Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails.The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by Hamas's attack, the deadliest in Israeli history.It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as US president.In a televised address on Saturday, Netanyahu called the 42-day first phase a "temporary ceasefire" and said Israel had US support to return to war if necessary. 'Playing with our emotions'  In Gaza City, shortly after the deal was initially meant to go into effect, people were already celebrating, waving Palestinian flags in the street.But as it became clear the hostilities were continuing, the joy gave way to desperation for some."I'm dying of despair," said Maha Abed, a 27-year-old displaced from Rafah who had been waiting since dawn for her husband to pick her up and take her home. "He called to tell me we won't be returning today. The drones are firing at civilians.""Enough playing with our emotions - we're exhausted," she added. "I don't want to spend another night in this tent."In Deir al-Balah, an AFP journalist observed dozens of Palestinians gathered in front of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital seeking information about the unfolding events, particularly whether or not they would be able to return to their homes.The Israeli army warned Gaza residents early Sunday not to approach its forces or Israeli territory."We urge you not to head towards the buffer zone or IDF forces for your safety," military spokesman Avichay Adraee said on Telegram."At this stage, heading towards the buffer zone or moving from south to north via Gaza Valley puts you at risk."At a rally for the hostages in Tel Aviv the night before, attendees were guarded ahead of the scheduled exchanges."I'm really stressed because I don't know about the situation of Ofer, my cousin," said Ifat Kaldron, whose cousin is among the hostages."I'm just going to be happy whenever I see the last hostage crossing the border."Israel has prepared reception centres to provide medical treatment and counselling to the freed hostages before they return to their families after their long ordeal.Israel's justice ministry had previously said 737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees would be freed during the deal's first phase, starting from 4:00 pm (1400 GMT) on Sunday.Egypt on Saturday said more than 1,890 Palestinian prisoners would be freed in the initial phase.Hundreds of trucks waited at the Gaza border, poised to enter from Egypt as soon as they get the all-clear to deliver desperately needed aid.Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said 600 trucks a day would enter Gaza after the ceasefire takes effect, including 50 carrying fuel.There has been only one previous truce in the war, lasting for one week in November 2023.That ceasefire also saw the release of hostages held by militants in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Of the 251 people taken hostage, 94 are still in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.Israel's retaliatory campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing at least 46,899 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.The truce was to take effect on the eve of Trump's inauguration for a second term as president of the United States.Trump, who claimed credit for the ceasefire deal, after months of effort by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden, told US network NBC on Saturday that he had told Netanyahu that the war "has to end"."We want it to end, but to keep doing what has to be done," he said.Brett McGurk, the pointman for outgoing President Joe Biden, was joined in the region by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff in an unusual pairing to finalise the agreement, US officials said.Under the deal, Israeli forces will withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza and allow displaced Palestinians to return "to their residences", the Qatari prime minister said.Biden said an unfinalised second phase of the agreement would bring a "permanent end to the war".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>According to reputable sources, the ongoing anti-corruption/anti-government protests are the largest in Serbia in 25 years, since the overthrow of Milosevic</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1i4ui7a/according_to_reputable_sources_the_ongoing/</link><author>/u/Porodicnostablo</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:04:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>India&apos;s investors unfazed as stock losses pile up</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLS4-Plyx8I</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[India's stock market rout has already wiped out $500 billion in market value as the country's economic growth takes a hit.

"Initial research suggested potato-size nodules rich in metals, predominantly found 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) below the surface in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, released an electrical charge, splitting seawater into oxygen and hydrogen through electrolysis."

 The unprecedented natural phenomenon challenges the idea that oxygen can only be made from sunlight via photosynthesis. Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the UK's Scottish Association for Marine Science who was behind the find, is embarking on a three-year project to investigate the production of "dark" oxygen further... Uncovering dark oxygen revealed just how little is known about the deep ocean, and the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ, in particular. The region is being explored for the deep-sea mining of rare metals contained in the rock nodules. The latter are formed over millions of years, and the metals play a key role in new and green technologies... 

Understanding the phenomenon better could also help space scientists find life beyond Earth, [Sweetman] added... Officials at NASA are interested in the research on dark oxygen production because it could inform scientific understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight, Sweetman said. The space agency wants to run experiments to understand the amount of energy required to potentially produce oxygen at higher pressures that occur on Enceladus and Europa, the icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter, respectively, he added. Those moons are among the targets for investigating the possibility of life. 

 Deep-sea mining companies are aiming to mine the cobalt, nickel, copper, lithium and manganese contained in the nodules for use in solar panels, electric car batteries and other green technology. Some companies have taken issue with Sweetman's research. Critics say deep-sea mining could irrevocably damage the pristine underwater environment and that it could disrupt the way carbon is stored in the ocean, contributing to the climate crisis. 

CNN's article also notes Massachusetts microbiologist Emil Ruff, who found unexpected oxygen far below the Canadian prairie in water isolated from the atmosphere for more than 40,000 years. 
"Nature keeps surprising us," he said. "There are so many things that people have said, 'Oh, this is impossible,' and then later it turns out it's not."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple lists all apps it removed alongside TikTok in the U.S.</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/18/apple-lists-all-apps-it-removed-alongside-tiktok-in-the-u-s/</link><author>Ivan Mehta</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 07:56:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In a rare move amid the TikTok shutdown, Apple has published a statement and a support document listing all affected apps that are inaccessible in the U.S. The iPhone maker typically doesn’t publish information when it blocks apps.

(Res.) Gal Hirsch has updated the families of the hostages through IDF representatives."We ask the media and the public to refrain from sharing the details of the list, exercise due caution, and maintain the privacy of the families," the PMO shared.Ceasefire initially delayedIDF Chief Spokesperson R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari announced at 8:30 a.m. local time on Sunday that the ceasefire that was meant to go into effect had been delayed as Hamas failed to provide the names of the three hostages that were meant to be released on the same day.Orange balloons are brought to the hostage demonstration to mark the second birthday of Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage, and to urge the government not to abandon the hostage deal on January 18, 2025. (credit: Paulina Patimer)This announcement came after a long night of security assessments following delays in the list. Hamas was meant to already provide the list of hostages 24 hours before their release. Three hostages are meant to be released on Sunday, but it is unclear who.Shortly after Netanyahu's announcement, the terrorist group released an official statement affirming its commitment to the ceasefire, stating that the delay in the names of the hostages to be released is due to technical issues.Earlier reports said that Hamas would reportedly hand over the list on Saturday night.Hamas sources told mediators that it would hand over the names of the hostages as soon as they had been transferred to a safe place. It is expected that three female soldiers will be released.Stay updated with the latest news!Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post NewsletterA Hamas source told  that the group is delaying the release of the names because of technical reasons. He said that "communication between [Hamas] operatives is done physically by messengers, and it takes them time to agree on the names and location of the hostages while IDF jets are still overhead."He added, "The list will only be released after approval from Hamas leader Muhammad Sinwar."In a statement on Saturday, Hamas revealed that it would publish lists of names the day before each exchange day.An Israeli source told KAN that they knew "Hamas would be manipulative" in not providing who would be released on Sunday.On the seventh day of the deal, four more hostages are expected to be released, and this procedure is expected to occur every week on Saturday for the next six weeks, leading up to the release of 33 more hostages.A source familiar with the details of the negotiations said that the next 24 hours are critical for the beginning of the implementation of the deal and that Israel feared that Hamas would try to violate it. A spokesperson for the Qatari Foreign Ministry said that "there has been no violation of the agreement."

An interesting take; I come across that the majority of the people seemed to believe is " is a blocking command. while  is non-blocking - so  is better". I don't fully agree with this characterisation.It's somewhat true - but it's not the full story. As an engineer, it's my moral duty to unnecessarily dive into the rabbit hole and dig into the Redis codebase to see the actual implementation. Let's see what's actually happening under the hood.DEL vs UNLINK - the only difference is the way they free the value (freeing the key is straightforward). Respectfully, It will be completely wrong to just say one is blocking and another is not.UNLINK is a smart command: it's not always non-blocking/async. It calculates the deallocation cost of an object, and if it is very small (cost of freeing < 64), it will just do what DEL is supposed to do and free the object ASAP. Otherwise, the object is sent to the background queue for processing.For my internet friends who aren't familiar with Redis - it's a super popular, distributed in-memory key-value database. As the name suggests, both  and  commands do the same thing - they remove the keys from Redis.A quick Google search tells you why UNLINK was introduced in Redis 4.0, if we already had DEL.  is very similar to  but it performs the memory reclaiming in a different thread - so it's not blocking other operations, while DEL is. In simple terms, UNLINK just unlinks the key from the keyspace, and actual key removal happens later, asynchronously - so it's faster.Fun fact - In redis 6.0, a new configuration  was introduced - so if this is set to true, your DEL command runs like UNLINK.But how it's implemented internally?It doesn't take a genius to find the very famous  in redis codebase, and head over to  method - thanks to Github symbol search.client ccserverlazyfree_lazy_user_delNot surprised - It just proxies the  method with the lazy flag which is sent as the value of  redis server config. I'm sure for , they are gonna just set it to always true - neat.client c lazycdbcargvj KEY_DELETED deleted   lazy cdbcargvjcdbcargvjccdbcargvjNOTIFY_GENERICcargvjcdbidcnumdelThere is too much to go through - but this beautiful ternary operator got my attention - the lazy flag decides which method to call. Now, we will go deeper into  and come back to  in UNLINK code analysis.Hold on - Redis using  as variable name? Where are all those clean code evangelists lecturing me about meaningful variable names? never mind.Let's get into . Let me guess - it shouldn't be hard deleting a key from a hash table. Ah, not really. My immature high-level language lover mind took garbage collectors for granted. For a language like C, it's very very interesting and important to pay attention to how memory gets released.redisDb db robj keydb key DB_FLAG_KEY_DELETEDAh, it's a proxy to  with  argument set as 0. Cool. Let's go to  .redisDb db robj key async flags slot keyptr    dictEntry de dbkeys slot keyptrplinktabledb slot valtypevaldbhexpires val need to incr to retain val keyvaldbidflagsdbkeyvaltype greater than  so freeObjAsync doesnt work keyde dbiddbkeys slot de the key because it is shared with the main dictionarydbexpires slot keyptrdbkeys slot de plink tableAhh I too found it overwhelming !! But I did find a couple of things really interesting here.The method int slot = getKeySlot(key->ptr); calculates the slot for the given key. Redis uses a hash slot mechanism to distribute keys across nodes in a cluster. Shamelessly plugging my tweet that explains the mechanism in a little detail.Redis moved away from the traditional way of removing the key long back. kvstoreDictTwoPhaseUnlinkFind method finds the key in the main dictionary using the slot number and the key. This is the first phase - it does not delete the key instead it sets up  and . In the second phase - key will be safely removed. kvstoreDictTwoPhaseUnlinkFree is what I'm referring to here. This immediately releases the memory.The  code block does a bunch of really nice things, like scheduling the memory to be freed up asynchronously. And also setting up the value of entry in main dict to NULL to mark it for deletion. We will dive into it in the UNLINK section.4. Delete expiration dataInteresting thing to note is redis maintains 2 dictionary - the main key dictionary and expiration dictionary. So, as a key is deleted - it needs to be removed from the expiration dict as well - manually. This is what -  method does.Well - so what have you learnt here? The normal DEL command implementation is quite straight forward. Synchronously remove the key and release the memory using the two-phase linking mechanism. This is done in both the main key dictionary and expiration dictionary. And if there is an inner reference - recursive deletion comes to the rescue.As we already covered the core logic and the code is generic with the  flag being passed down, lets' dive straight into how async delete is actually happening.keyde dbiddbkeys slot deWohoo, jump to .robj key robj obj dbid    size_t free_effort keyobjdbid possible This rarely happens however sometimes the implementation of parts of the Redis core may call  to protect objects then call free_effort  LAZYFREE_THRESHOLD  objrefcount lazyfree_objectslazyfreeFreeObjectobjDamn, that's smart - it calculates the cost of deleting the object. Once it gets how expensive it is (free_effort indicates efforts in terms of CPU, time and memory usage may be?) - it decides to either free the memory immediately or delay it for later once it has enough CPU cycles to do it. is set as 64. And the check  ensures that object is no-longer referenced anywhere else otherwise it might get stuck in removing it's references recursively. is just an atomic increment counter operation on global variable  that has the number of objects currently being freezed lazily. It helps redis in scheduling the operations in the background. is responsible for creating a job in background IO (BIO) to lazily free the object.  is a callback function defined on line 13 of this file.How effort for deleting the key is calculated?Redis' codebase says - the return value is not always the actual number of allocations the object is composed of, but a number proportional to it.for strings, it is always 1 as it does not require multiple allocations to free - so constant effortfor list objects - it is the number of elements in the quicklist.for set objects - it is the number of elements in the hash table as set is backed by hashtable.for sorted set objects - it is the length of skiplistfor hash objects - it is the number of elements in the hash tablefor stream objects - it is the number of RAX nodes + consumer groups + entries in pending entry list (PEL)for module - the process of calculating the value in this case seems a bit complicated for me to understand. It uses .The magic number LAZYFREE_THRESHOLD = 64Although, there is no clear explanation of  as 64, so it seems a bit arbitrary. A couple of my internet stranger friends and chatGPT says this number was chosen by  redis developers post a massive benchmarking. The consideration was trade-off such as performance vs blocking, memory management and avoiding overhead.Now that I’ve wrapped up my ramblings, I invite your comments on it.

Effectful computations in Haskell are first class values. This means we can
store them in variables or data structures for later use. There is a Haskell
function
 (, ) 
which, when given two integers as arguments, picks a random integer between
them. We can put calls to this function into a list, like so:
 [ randomRIO(1, 6), randomRIO(1, 6) ]

This is a list of two calls to . What surprises non-Haskellers is
that when this list is created, no random numbers are generated. Coming from
other programming languages, we are used to side effects (such as random
generation) being executed directly when the side effectful function is
called.
We can add more random generation to the list:
 some_dice  [ randomRIO(1, 6) ]

and still no random numbers will be generated. We can go ahead and manipulate
this list in all sorts of ways, and  no random numbers would be
generated.

To be clear, the  function could well be called, and when
it is called it returns a value of type . It’s just that this value . If anything, we can think of it as a set of instructions for
eventually, somehow, getting an integer. It’s not an actual integer. It’s an
object encapsulating a side effect. When this side effect object executes, it
will produce a random integer, but the object itself just describes the
computation, it is not an integer.

In other words, in Haskell, it is not enough to call a side effectful function
to execute its side effects. When we call the side effectful function, it
produces an object encapsulating the side effect, and this object can be
executed in the future to produce the result of the side effect.
The common way we teach beginners to do execute side effect objects is by
calling them from a  block, using the special  assignment operator to
extract their result. As a first approximation, we can think of the following
code as the way to force side effects to execute.

  side  randomRIO(1, 6)
  printf  side

We can imagine that the  arrow executes the side effect object returned by
 and captures the value it produces. Similarly, the side effect
object returned by  gets executed, but we don’t capture the result; we
don’t care about the value produced by it, we only care about the side effect
itself.

The lie-to-children here is that we pretend the  block is magical and that
when it executes, it also executes side effects of functions called in it. This
mental model will take the beginner a long way, but at some point, one will want
to break free of it. That is when Haskell starts to really shine as a procedural
language.

This article features another lie-to-children: it will have type signatures
specialised to  and . All the functions I mention are more generic
than I’m letting on.
Anywhere this article says  it will work with any type of side effect
(like , , , etc.)Anywhere this article says  it probably also works with other
collection/container types (like , , , , etc.)
The reason this article uses more direct type signatures is to hopefully be
readable also to someone who does not use Haskell.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A &apos;Hubble Crisis&apos;? New Measurement Confirms Universe is Expanding Too Fast for Current Models</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/01/19/0422230/a-hubble-crisis-new-measurement-confirms-universe-is-expanding-too-fast-for-current-models?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 05:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["The universe is expanding faster than predicted by theoretical models," writes Phys.org, "and faster than can be explained by our current understanding of physics." There's now been new confirmation of this (published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters) by a team led by Dan Scolnic, an associate professor of physics at Duke University. 

And this means the so-called Hubble tension "now turns into a crisis," said Dan Scolnic, who led the research team... This is saying, to some respect, that our model of cosmology might be broken."
Measuring the universe requires a cosmic ladder, which is a succession of methods used to measure the distances to celestial objects, with each method, or "rung," relying on the previous for calibration. The ladder used by Scolnic was created by a separate team using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which is observing more than 100,000 galaxies every night from its vantage point at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. Scolnic recognized that this ladder could be anchored closer to Earth with a more precise distance to the Coma Cluster, one of the galaxy clusters nearest to us. "The DESI collaboration did the really hard part, their ladder was missing the first rung," said Scolnic. "I knew how to get it, and I knew that that would give us one of the most precise measurements of the Hubble constant we could get, so when their paper came out, I dropped absolutely everything and worked on this non-stop." 

To get a precise distance to the Coma cluster, Scolnic and his collaborators used the light curves from 12 Type Ia supernovae within the cluster. Just like candles lighting a dark path, Type Ia supernovae have a predictable luminosity that correlates to their distance, making them reliable objects for distance calculations. The team arrived at a distance of about 320 million light-years, nearly in the center of the range of distances reported across 40 years of previous studies — a reassuring sign of its accuracy. "This measurement isn't biased by how we think the Hubble tension story will end," said Scolnic. "This cluster is in our backyard, it has been measured long before anyone knew how important it was going to be." 

The results? "It matches the universe's expansion rate as other teams have recently measured it," writes Phys.org, "but not as our current understanding of physics predicts it. The longstanding question is: is the flaw in the measurements or in the models? Scolnic's team's new results add tremendous support to the emerging picture that the root of the Hubble tension lies in the models..." 

And the article closes with this quote from Scolnic:

"Ultimately, even though we're swapping out so many of the pieces, we all still get a very similar number. So, for me, this is as good of a confirmation as it's ever gotten. We're at a point where we're pressing really hard against the models we've been using for two and a half decades, and we're seeing that things aren't matching up," said Scolnic. 

"This may be reshaping how we think about the universe, and it's exciting!

However, the company began restoring service by midday Sunday.TikTok users began receiving a message about the ban around 10:30 p.m. Eastern on Saturday evening, and the app also disappeared from the Apple and Google Play app stores. As of Sunday morning, some users in the U.S.  could still access TikTok via the web.“Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” the company’s message reads. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”The message also suggested this might only be a temporary disappearance. TikTok credited President-elect Donald Trump for indicating “he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office,” with users urged to “stay tuned!”The company warned earlier this week the app’s disappearance was imminent, saying Friday that it would “go dark” unless President Joe Biden’s administration made a “definitive statement” that it wouldn’t enforce the ban.The Supreme Court issued a ruling upholding the law Friday; and the Biden administration seemed inclined to leave the app’s fate in the hands of the next president. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that with the law taking effect right before Trump’s inauguration on Monday, “actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration.” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco issued a similar statement that “the next phase of this effort — implementing and ensuring compliance with the law after it goes into effect on January 19 — will be a process that plays out over time.”TikTok, however, suggested this was not enough assurance for “critical service providers” to continue listing or hosting the app in the United States unless the Biden administration made the aforementioned “definitive statement.” Jean-Pierre called TikTok’s response “a stunt” and claimed there’s “no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday.”As for the app’s long-term prospects, Trump has said he plans to “negotiate a resolution” that would presumably involve a sale or other concessions from ByteDance, which has repeatedly said it’s not interested in selling yet seems optimistic about its prospects under Trump. Trump reiterated to NBC News on Saturday that he will “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban once he takes office Monday.“I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” Trump told the outlet.There was even a report suggesting that the Chinese government was considering a sale to Elon Musk as part of a broader deal with the Trump administration. A TikTok spokesperson called that report “pure fiction.”This post has been updated to reflect that TikTok is restoring service. It was previously updated to reflect Trump’s statements Sunday morning, as well as the additional apps that have been blocked by the law.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After PFAS Contamination on English Channel Island, Government Panel Recommends Bloodletting for Those Affected</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/01/18/2310259/after-pfas-contamination-on-english-channel-island-government-panel-recommends-bloodletting-for-those-affected?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 03:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jersey is an island in the English channel, "a self-governing British Crown Dependency near the coast of northwest France," according to Wikipedia — population: 103,267. 

But now some residents of Jersey "have been recommended bloodletting to reduce high concentrations of 'forever chemicals' in their blood," reports the Guardian, "after tests showed some islanders have levels that can lead to health problems."


Private drinking water supplies in Jersey were polluted by the use of firefighting foams containing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) at the island's airport, which were manufactured by the U.S. multinational 3M. .. Bloodletting draws blood from a vein in measured amounts. It is safe and the body replenishes the blood naturally, but it must be repeated until clean... 

In response to the blood results, the government established an independent PFAS scientific advisory panel to advise public policy. The panel's first report recommended that the government should look at offering bloodletting to affected residents. "Studies show that bloodletting is an effective way to lower levels of PFAS in blood," said Ian Cousins, one of the panel members, though he added that there were no guarantees the process would prevent or cure diseases associated with the chemicals. The therapy costs about £100,000 upfront and then as much as £200,000 a year to treat 50 people. The panel is also considering the benefit of the drug cholestyramine, which a study has shown reduces PFAS in blood more quickly and cheaply, albeit with possible side effects. The government says it plans to launch a clinical service by early 2025. 

Contamination persisted on the island for decades. "We know they started to use 3M's firefighting foam in the 1960s and then ramped up in the 1990s in weekly fire training exercises, after which foam started to appear in nearby streams," said Jeremy Snowdon, a former Jersey airport engineer who drank contaminated water for years. He has measured elevated levels of PFAS in his own blood and has high cholesterol. 

The article includes this quote from one of the 88 residents of the polluted area found to have high levels of PFAS after blood testing. "I just want this out of my body. I don't want to end up with bladder cancer."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>On Eve of TikTok Ban, Chinese App RedNote Surges in Popularity, Delighting Chinese State Media</title><link>https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/01/19/0016233/on-eve-of-tiktok-ban-chinese-app-rednote-surges-in-popularity-delighting-chinese-state-media?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 01:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chinese social-networking site RedNote became the #1 most-downloaded app in America, reports the Associated Press, with some new users considering it a way to protest America's possible TikTok ban. 

So what happened next?
They were met with surprise, curiosity and in-jokes on Xiaohongshu — literally, "Little Red Book" — whose users saw English-language posts take over feeds almost overnight. Americans introduced themselves with hashtag TikTok refugees, ask me anything attitude and posting photos of their pets to pay their hosts' "cat tax." Parents swapped stories about raising kids and Swifties from both countries, of course, quickly found each other. It's a rare moment of direct contact between two online worlds that are usually kept apart by language, corporate boundaries, and China's strict system of online censorship that blocks access to nearly all international media and social media services... Xiaohongshu's 300 million monthly active users are overwhelmingly Chinese — so much so that parts of its interface have no English-language version... [Press reports suggest about a million of TikTok's 170 million users tried switching to RedNote this week...] 

On the platform, two versions of the TikTok refugee hashtag have over 24 million posts, with related posts appearing at the top of many users' feeds. A large number of American users say they've received a warm welcome from the community, with #TikTokrefugee. "Welcome the global villagers" remains the top one trending topic on Xiaohongshu, with 8.9 million views on Thursday. Users from both countries are comparing notes on grocery prices, rent, health insurance, medical bills and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Parents talk about what the kids learn in school in two countries. Some have already joined book clubs and are building up a community. American users asked how Chinese see the LGBTQ community and got warned that it was among sensitive topics, Chinese users taught Americans what are sensitive topics and key words to avoid censorship on the app. Chinese students pulled out their English homework, looking for help. 

Chinese state media, which have long dismissed U.S. allegations against TikTok, have welcomed the protest against the ban. People's Daily [the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party], said in an op-ed about TikTok refugees on Thursday that says the TikTok refugees found a "new home," and "openness, communication, and mutual learning are the unchanging themes of mankind and the heartfelt desires of people from all countries." 
Making the most of the moment is Jianlu Bi, who is apparently a senior content producer for Beijing's state-run China Global Television Network, which Wikipedia describes as "under the control of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party". Friday Jianlu Bi crafted an article claiming "surprising" and "stark contrasts" were revealed:
While the United States is often portrayed as a land of limitless opportunity, many American netizens have shared their struggles with high living costs, particularly in urban areas. One common theme is the exorbitant cost of healthcare. "I just got a simple bill for a routine checkup and it was over $500," shared one American user. "I can't imagine what a serious illness would cost! I feel like I'm constantly on the brink of financial ruin due to medical expenses." In contrast, Chinese netizens often express surprise at the affordability of many goods and services in their home country. For instance, the cost of housing, particularly in smaller cities, is often significantly lower in China compared to the United States.... This disparity is often attributed to factors such as government policies, economic development, and cultural differences... 

Traditional media narratives often present simplified and often biased portrayals of China and the United States. For example, the U.S. is often portrayed as a land of opportunity with limitless possibilities, while China is sometimes depicted as a country with limited freedoms. Xiaohongshu, on the other hand, provides a platform for ordinary people to share their authentic experiences and perspectives... A Chinese student studying in the U.S. shared, "I was surprised to learn that many of my classmates are working part-time jobs to cover their tuition and living expenses. This is very different from the image of affluent American students I had in my mind. It really opened my eyes to the realities of life for many young people in the U.S." 

"As social media continues to evolve, these platforms will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in shaping global perceptions..." the article concludes.

JP Morgan's five-days-a-week return-to-office mandate was only the beginning, with big companies like Amazon and Dell "tightening remote-work policies, shrinking travel budgets and cutting back on benefits... Companies are slashing perks such as college-tuition assistance and time off for a sick pet... "


76% of [U.S.] job growth in the past year has been in healthcare and education, leisure and hospitality, and government. In fields such as finance, information, and professional and business services, job growth has been far weaker. While a shift in leverage to employers might have shown up in layoffs or wage cuts in the past, now it is more subtle, often in changes to working conditions. For example, knowing that some workers will quit rather than return to the office, some companies are ending remote work as a way of trimming payroll. "Quiet quitting" — workers who slacked off rather than quit — has been replaced by "quiet cutting" — employers who cut jobs without actually announcing job cuts... 

Michael Gibbs, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, said the new mandates might simply be a message to workers that times have changed. "Firms are trying to reset expectations," he said... [After refusing her employers return-to-office four-days-a-week mandate, Mayrian] Sanz, who now works as an independent business and leadership coach, said she applied for 25 to 30 jobs listed as remote but initially got no responses. When some hiring managers finally replied, they had a surprise: Jobs listed as remote would now be in-office. "They just say everything is shifting to going back to the office," she said. 

Among tech workers, the share receiving perks such as paid volunteer hours, college-tuition reimbursement, free financial advice and mental-health programs all declined by about 4 percentage points in 2024 from 2023, according to Dice, a technology job board. Average bonuses fell by more than $800, from $15,011 to $14,194. Meanwhile, Netflix has quietly backed off from its unlimited parental leave in a child's first year, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. A company spokesman said at that time that employees have the freedom and flexibility to determine what is best for them. 

The article notes that "The actual impact of return-to-office directives remains to be seen," with economists "skeptical" the directives make companies more productive and faster-growing:

Many workers now being called in were already spending some time in their cubicles. Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University, said most of the benefits of collaboration can be achieved with just a few days in the office, while some tasks that require concentration are better done at home. 
Elsewhere the Wall Street Journal that looking for a job "is set to get less miserable this year," since roughly two-thirds of U.S. employers plan to add permanent roles within the next six months, "according to a new survey by staffing and consulting firm Robert Half." 

And Computerworld notes that the IT unemployment rate is now just 2% in the U.S. (according to official figures from the US Bureau of Labor statistics).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How The 20th Century Nearly Destroyed Europe&apos;s Monarchies</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqMpwTtDnLw</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 22:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In many ways the World Wars ushered in our modern world.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

By gradually occupying positions of power in politics, the judiciary and the media and steadily expanding its sphere of influence. Adherents have been bolstered by Trump’s 2024 election victory.

The tightening of abortion laws, the 2021 storming of the Capitol, a flare-up in racist violence: The US far-right has never been more powerful and visible than it is today - and that’s not just due to Donald Trump. The ultra-right has managed to gain a foothold at the very heart of US politics. As part of a strategy to win the 2024 election, it was ready to create a social divide similar to that of the secessionist wars, plunge the country into chaos and cause democracy to totter.
The triumph of the radical right is the outcome of a well-thought-out strategy set in motion more than 40 years ago by a conservative minority thirsty for power. And this group has pushed through its agenda under the nose of the world. Today, we can see how successful its strategy was: The ultra-right has gained control of the key centers of power, a process accelerated on all levels by Donald Trump. With his help, the ultra-right now has control of the Supreme Court. Its advance continues unabated, with Trump’s election victory marking an interim high point.

ABSTRACT
Functional programming is a useful technique. We spend a lot of time discussing it in the context of hard, challenging or interesting problems, but no where nearly enough in the context of mundane problems.

The UNIX shell, or command line interpreter. A simple, but useful program too often mistaken as complex, or mysterious. Almost every programmer is exposed to shells from a users perspective, but far fewer have ever implemented one, or even know where to start.

This talk aims to be a fun look at using functional programming in and around a traditional, some would say mundane, system utility. We will work through the concepts involved with implementing your own shell, and live code our way to a basic functional shell implemented in Haskell.

From this talk, attendees will walk a way with a better understanding of a program they use every day, as well as ideas and inspiration around using functional programming to solve mundane programming problems.

The findings appear in a pre-print paper titled "How is Google using AI for internal code migrations?" The Register reports: Their focus is on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas, such as Ads, Search, Workspace and YouTube, instead of generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services like code completion, code review, and question answering. Google's code migrations involved: changing 32-bit IDs in the 500-plus-million-line codebase for Google Ads to 64-bit IDs; converting its old JUnit3 testing library to JUnit4; and replacing the Joda time library with Java's standard java.time package. The int32 to int64 migration, the Googlers explain, was not trivial as the IDs were often generically defined (int32_t in C++ or Integer in Java) and were not easily searchable. They existed in tens of thousands of code locations across thousands of files. Changes had to be tracked across multiple teams and changes to class interfaces had to be considered across multiple files. "The full effort, if done manually, was expected to require hundreds of software engineering years and complex crossteam coordination," the authors explain.
 
For their LLM-based workflow, Google's software engineers implemented the following process. An engineer from Ads would identify an ID in need of migration using a combination of code search, Kythe, and custom scripts. Then an LLM-based migration toolkit, triggered by someone knowledgeable in the art, was run to generate verified changes containing code that passed unit tests. Those changes would be manually checked by the same engineer and potentially corrected. Thereafter, the code changes would be sent to multiple reviewers who are responsible for the portion of the codebase affected by the changes. The result was that 80 percent of the code modifications in the change lists (CLs) were purely the product of AI; the remainder were either human-authored or human-edited AI suggestions.
 
"We discovered that in most cases, the human needed to revert at least some changes the model made that were either incorrect or not necessary," the authors observe. "Given the complexity and sensitive nature of the modified code, effort has to be spent in carefully rolling out each change to users." Based on this, Google undertook further work on LLM-driven verification to reduce the need for detailed review. Even with the need to double-check the LLM's work, the authors estimate that the time required to complete the migration was reduced by 50 percent. With LLM assistance, it took just three months to migrate 5,359 files and modify 149,000 lines of code to complete the JUnit3-JUnit4 transition. Approximately 87 percent of the code generated by AI ended up being committed with no changes. As for the Joda-Java time framework switch, the authors estimate a time saving of 89 percent compared to the projected manual change time, though no specifics were provided to support that assertion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Robotics and ROS 2 Essentials</title><link>https://henkirobotics.com/robotics-and-ros-2-essentials-course-announcement/</link><author>dtquad</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 22:52:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you been looking for a good place to start your robotics and ROS 2 learning journey? Look no further!We are proud to announce that together with the University of Eastern Finland, we have open-sourced the robotics part from our “Robotics & XR” master’s-level course. You can find the course materials and all the hands-on exercises on GitHub: Robotics & ROS 2 EssentialsWhat is the course about?Last semester we were offered the opportunity to help develop the latest iteration of the “Robotics & XR” course for the University of Eastern Finland (UEF). Combining UEF’s broad theoretical robotics expertise, and the industry knowledge from Henki Robotics, we wanted to upgrade the existing Robotics course to prepare students with the most up-to-date skills required for modern robotics development. The course goes through the essential robotics skills and the basic concepts related to ROS 2, which is nowadays the most commonly used robotics development framework.Why did we open-source the course?People and students often ask where and how they should start learning robotics and ROS 2. Robotics is a rapidly growing field, so more and more experts are needed in the area. We believe in open source and knowledge sharing, so we wanted to make the course material available for everyone, for free!What Will I Learn from following this course?The main goal of the course is to be a beginner-friendly introduction to robotics and ROS 2, and it has a focus on learning by doing and experimenting through exercises. The practical exercises that accompany the theoretical content are based on a Gazebo simulation with the simulated Andino robot from Ekumen. The course exercises cover the following topics:SetupRun the Gazebo simulationROS 2 IntroductionROS 2 topics; publish and subscribeTransformations and tf-framesRobot OdometryCalculate and publish your robot’s odometry using wheel velocitiesRobot odometry and how to calculate itPublish and subscribe to topics from Python codePath PlanningBasic navigation conceptsCustom path planning using Nav2Do I need ROS 2 installed?No preliminary ROS 2 installation is required. Instead, the course uses Docker to provide all the course exercises in a containerized environment, requiring no manual installation of ROS 2, simulation, packages, and dependencies. All you need is an Ubuntu Operating System and Docker installed, and you are all set! Learning to use Docker is also a valuable skill, as it is a widely used tool in the software development industry, not just in robotics.We are always looking to improve our work and provide the best learning experience for people looking to learn the basics of ROS. Feel free to send us your feedback, and if you encounter any issues while following the course, or have any suggestions for improvements, do not hesitate to reach out to us!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatLoopBackOff - Episode 43 (KubeVela)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClbJB-m0Kc4</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:41:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[KubeVela, an incubating CNCF project, is a modern application delivery platform that simplifies the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.

Michael Imperioli's maternal grandfather, Alberto Luzzi, was born in New York City in June, 1914. Alberto had a difficult childhood due to the early passing of his father, Michael's great grandfather, who died in an accident cleaning trains for the transit system. Michael's great grandfather grew up in Calabria, Italy, before moving to America after getting married. 

Michael Imperioli is best known for his starring role as Christopher Moltisanti in the acclaimed iconic HBO TV series THE SOPRANOS, which earned him a Best Supporting Actor Emmy Award. He also wrote 5 episodes of the show and was co-screenwriter of the film SUMMER OF SAM, directed by Spike Lee. Imperioli has appeared in six of Lee’s films and has also acted in films by Martin Scorsese, Abel Ferrara, Walter Hill, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes Brothers. Michael was also seen in HBO's second season of Mike White’s critically acclaimed hit series THE WHITE LOTUS.

This film shows how this commitment became a pillar of society. What measures are needed today to defend humanist values and preserve democratic achievements?

The film provides an insight into the challenges and hopes of remembrance culture work and examines how the motto ‘never again’ is evolving into an educational policy obligation in Germany.

With the end of the Second World War, two words became an integral part of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany: ‘Never again’. Never again fascism, never again war, never again a dictatorship like National Socialism, in which minorities are persecuted, disenfranchised and murdered. This endeavor gave rise to a culture of remembrance, which manifested itself in the form of education in schools, memorials and days of remembrance.

But sometimes, it seems like the more frequently these words appear in official speeches, the more they lose their clarity and meaning. The discourse on a meaningful culture of remembrance is mainly conducted in academia, and often doesn’t consider the realities of life in society at large.
 
The documentary is an incisive and confrontational look at practical remembrance work. It shows what measures need to be taken to protect democracy and human rights in Germany. It focuses on the everyday lives of those who put the culture of remembrance into practice, and those who benefit from it.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.

The latest feature extends the  to support direct interaction with class diagrams, offering users a variety of tools to enhance their diagramming experience.In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the new features in the , how to use them, and what changes have been made to streamline editing class diagrams. Let’s dive in!Class diagrams are a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used to model the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between objects. They are a fundamental tool in object-oriented design and help visualize how different parts of a system interact with each other. represent entities, such as objects or concepts. are the properties or characteristics of classes. are the actions or operations that a class can perform. (e.g., associations, inheritance) show how classes are connected or interact.Here’s an example of a basic Mermaid class diagram when rendered by Mermaid:This is the code that generated the diagram:classDiagram
    ClassA <|-- ClassB
    ClassB : +String name
    ClassB : +int age
    ClassB : +void displayDetails()
    ClassC o-- ClassB
    ClassC : +String descriptionLooking at the code, you can see how it represents the diagram: is a parent of , indicated by . has two attributes ( and ) and one method (). has an  (denoted by ) with  and an attribute .Previously, creating or editing such diagrams would require manually writing or modifying the Mermaid syntax. Now, with the new , you can easily create and update these diagrams with just a few clicks.The  introduces several new tools for class diagrams:Change Diagram Rendering Direction: Adjust the diagram’s layout, whether it’s top-down, left-right, etc.: Easily add new classes to the diagram.: Add a title to the diagram or insert notes not linked to specific classes.: Define a placeholder for classes that belong to a specific namespace.Update Diagram Configuration: Toggle options like the visibility of the  for a cleaner look.: Select from various themes and adjust the look and feel of the diagram for better presentation.With these tools, you can interact with your diagrams dynamically, significantly reducing the effort required to manage complex relationships and attributes.Creating New Classes and RelationshipsOne of the most powerful features of the new editor is its intuitive way of adding new classes and establishing relationships between them. Here’s how it works:Create a New Class with an Existing Relationship: Click on an existing class in your diagram, then drag to an empty space. A new class will appear with a direct relationship to the original class.Create Relationships Between Existing Classes: Quickly establish relationships between existing classes by dragging from one class and dropping the relationship line onto another class. This eliminates the need for manual code input.When working with relationships, you can click on any existing connection to bring up a toolbar. This toolbar allows you to:Change the type of relationship (e.g., inheritance, association).Set the cardinalities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).Add labels to relationships by double-clicking on the connection.These controls make it easy to iterate on your diagram as your design evolves.The Visual Editor provides a powerful dialog interface for modifying class properties without touching any code. When you double-click on a class in your diagram, a comprehensive editing panel appears that lets you fine-tune every aspect of the class definition.At the top of the dialog, you can specify the class’s annotation (such as “Abstract”) and modify its name. Below that, the interface is divided into clear sections for attributes and methods. Each class property can be precisely configured:Define visibility modifiers (like public/private using  or ).Set the data type (such as , ).Specify the attribute name.Add additional modifiers as needed.Set the method visibility.Specify method names and parameters.Add or remove methods with intuitive controls.The editor maintains proper UML syntax automatically, handling details like the abstract class notation (shown as «Abstract» in the diagram) and proper formatting of attributes and methods. Changes are previewed in real-time, and you can either save your modifications or cancel to revert to the previous state.This visual approach to class editing makes it significantly easier to maintain complex class diagrams, especially for team members who might be less familiar with Mermaid’s syntax.Additional Tips for Optimizing Your DiagramsExperiment with Different Layouts: Play with layout and theme options to find the best look for your diagram.: Use the note feature to explain parts of your diagram, helping to clarify complex relationships.The new Mermaid Visual Editor tools make diagramming more efficient and accessible. Whether you’re building a new class diagram from scratch or refining an existing one, these updates save you time and effort, letting you focus on what truly matters: the design and structure of your system.Start exploring these features today and take your class diagrams to the next level! Here’s how to get started: Open up a new diagram and click on “ER Diagram” from the Templates menu in the editor.Edit, tweak, and automate: Use our simple code editor (or message Mermaid AI) to fine-tune your diagram to fit your needs.We wish you luck in creating effective class diagrams!Creator of MermaidJS and founder of Mermaid Chart]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban, but Trump might offer lifeline</title><link>https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/17/supreme-court-rules-to-uphold-tiktok-ban.html</link><author>kjhughes</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:23:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law requiring China-based ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok by Sunday or face an effective ban of the popular social video app in the U.S.ByteDance has so far refused to sell TikTok, meaning many U.S. users could lose access to the app this weekend. The app may still work for those who already have TikTok on their phones, although ByteDance has also threatened to shut the app down.In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, upholding the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Bidensigned in April."There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community," the Supreme Court's opinion said. "But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary."Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote concurrences.TikTok's fate in the U.S. now lies in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump,  who originally favored a TikTok ban during his first administration, but has since flip-flopped on the matter. In December, Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation and allow his administration "the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case."In a post on his social media app Truth Social, Trump wrote that the decision was expected "and everyone must respect it.""My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!" Trump wrote.Trump began to speak more favorably of TikTok after he met in February with billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass. Yass is a major ByteDance investor who also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social.In a video posted on TikTok, Chew thanked Trump "for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available" in the U.S. He said use of TikTok is a First Amendment right, adding that over 7 million American businesses use it to make money and find customers."Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come," he said.  The nation's highest court said in the opinion that while "data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age," the sheer size of TikTok and its "susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects" poses a national security concern.Under the terms of the law, third-party internet service providers such as  and  will be penalized for supporting a ByteDance-owned TikTok after the Jan. 19 deadline.If service providers and app store owners comply, consumers will be unable to install the necessary updates that make the app functional.Representatives of TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Users look for alternativesWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated Biden's support for the law in a statement, saying "TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law.""Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday," Pierre said.Attorney General Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco, his deputy, said in a release that the decision "enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security."Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology nonprofit, criticized the ruling, saying in a statement that it "harms the free expression of hundreds of millions of TikTok users in this country and around the world."In December, members of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, urging the executives to begin preparing to comply with the law.Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, speaks to reporters outside the office of Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) at the Russell Senate Office Building on March 14, 2024 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesOn Jan. 10, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments from lawyers representing TikTok, content creators and the U.S. government. TikTok's lead lawyer, Noel Francisco, argued that the law violates the First Amendment rights of the app's 170 million American users. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the app's alleged ties to the Chinese government pose a national security threat.  Many TikTok creators have been telling their fans to find them on competing social platforms such as Google's YouTube and  Facebook and Instagram, CNBC reported. Additionally, Instagram leaders scheduled meetings after the Jan. 10 Supreme Court hearing to direct workers to prepare for a wave of users if the court upholds the law.Chinese social media app and TikTok look-alike RedNote rose to the top of Apple's app store Monday, indicating that TikTok's millions of users were seeking alternatives.The Chinese government also weighed a contingency plan that would have X owner Elon Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations as part of several options intended to keep the app from its effective ban in the U.S., Bloomberg News reported Monday.Should ByteDance decide to sell TikTok to a U.S. company or group of investors, potential buyers may have to pay between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to an estimate by CFRA Research Senior Vice President Angelo Zino.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vulkan 1.4.305 Published With Three New Extensions</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Vulkan-1.4.305-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:23:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Vulkan 1.4.305 has been published as the newest version of the Vulkan API specification for high performance graphics and compute...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 To Add Support For SpacemiT&apos;s &quot;Energy Efficient AI&quot; RISC-V CPUs</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-SpaceMiT-RISC-V-CPUs</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:02:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The upcoming Linux 6.14 kernel is poised to introduce initial support for SpacemiT platforms, the Chinese computing chip company developing "next-generation RISC-V high-performance CPUs."

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

ABSTRACT
Application and Infrastructure configuration is usually an easy place to make catastrophic mistakes. The new Pkl configuration language brings a safer and more maintainable approach to defining and managing configuration. It works with Kubernetes, Spring applications, and really anywhere that you have Yaml or other unstructured configuration.

This talk will introduce Pkl and teach you how to use it in your Java applications and infrastructure. If you've written Yaml or used other configuration approaches, this talk will help you understand how Pkl can provide a better foundation for more safe and maintainable configuration. [...]

Reporting done on this article: Hacker News, Ars Technica, Louis Rossmann. Also there's now a RSS feed if you want to be updated, I've reached to Canon myself.Companies squeezing every last penny out of their customers is no news. And Canonisnostranger.Last year, I've bought a Canon G5 X II camera which I wanted to use mainly for taking pictures at concerts. For me, it was the perfect match of focal range () and sensor size () for any compact camera I've compared. Because I'm only using this camera for a small range of events, it's just collecting dust in the meantime. So, why don't use it as a webcam with my Macbook?Admittedly, it did not cost me the $6300 from the article's title, much closer to $900. Nonetheless, everything I'm describing translates to every other Canon camera model!Problems Problems ProblemsI've tried this at first in 2024 with macOS 14, which did not work. I had similar experience with FUJIFILM's X Webcam software where either the camera will not get recognized by the software or the camera feed will freeze or simply be not available within other apps.As of January 2025 with macOS 15 Sequoia, these issues have been resolved for me.Well actually, only if you are able to download the software at all. Seems like their Microsoft IIS server is having some issues. The following error page will be presented to you, after they asked you for your full legal name and mail address - without which you can not download the software.So I've been really excited when I finally found a downloadable file on the Canon webpage which was not blocked by a faulty newsletter grift and saw the live feed of my camera!Well the excitement didn't last long since nearly every single setting is disabled if you're using the software without a paying Canon account.No brightness adjustments, no color correction, only 720p. Even in the paid version there doesn't seem to be a white balance adjustment setting.Canon will happily take your credit card for you to pay a small monthly price of $4.99 per month or even a discounted $49.99 per year!** The 30-day free trial is valued at $4.99 and can be cancelled at any time during the free trial period through your MyCanon Account Dashboard. After the free trial period, your subscription will automatically be rolled over into the annual or monthly non-refundable, auto-renewable subscription selected upon enrollment in the free trial, which can be cancelled at any time through your MyCanon Account Dashboard. The current available subscription plans are $49.99/year or $4.99/month.In a support document, Canon lists all differences between the free and paid version. So you can be very gladful, they allow you to even connect the camera.Software development isn’t free, and I’m happy to pay for software I use regularly. However, Canon is a hardware company, not a software company, and they should—due to the lack of standards—provide software that allows you to use their cameras as intended. Aside from development costs, there’s no justification for a subscription model, particularly from a company earning nearly $1.9 billion in profit*.So Canon will not allow you to use  camera on  computer with  cables the way you intent to without paying for another subscription.* In an earlier version of this article I wrote "$3 billion in profit"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatLoopBackOff - Episode 42 (K8gb)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKUNI6E1_7c</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 05:58:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[K8gb is an open-source global load balancer specifically designed for Kubernetes, by enabling high availability, seamless failover without manual intervention.

You just load the image pixels somehow, perhaps using a readily available library, and then display those pixels on the screen. Easy, right? Well, not quite, as it turns out.I may have some experience with this, because I made an image viewer that displays images in the terminal emulator. But why do such a thing, there are countless image viewers already available, including those that work with terminal emulators, why write yet another one? That’s an excellent question! As always, the answer is because no other viewer was good enough for me.For example, catimg uses stb_image to load images. While stb_image is an outstanding library that can be integrated very quickly, it doesn’t really excel in the number of image formats it supports. There’s the baseline of JPEG, PNG, GIF, plus a few other more or less obscure formats.Another example is viu, which again is limited to the well-known baseline of three “web” formats, with the modern addition of WebP. Following the dependency graph of the program shows that the image loading library it uses should support more formats, but ultimately I’m interested in what the executable I have on my system can do, not what some readme says.The overall situation is that there is widespread expectation and support for viewing PNG files (1996), JPEG files (1992) and GIF files (1987). So… what happened? Did image compression research fizzle out in the XXI century? Of course not. There’s JPEG XL (2022), AVIF (2019), HEIC (2017), WebP (2010). The question now is, why is there no wide support for these image codecs in software? Because nobody uses them. And why is nobody using them? Because there’s no software support.So maybe these new formats just aren’t worth it, maybe they don’t add enough value to be supported? Fortunately, that’s easy to answer with the following image. Which of the quality + size combinations do you prefer?But that’s not all. There is a variety of image formats that are arguably intended for more specialized use. And these formats are old, too. Ericsson Texture Compression (ETC) was developed in 2005, while Block Compression (BC) and OpenEXR date back to 1999. BC is supported by all desktop GPUs, and virtually all games use it. ETC is supported by all mobile GPUs. So why is it nearly impossible to find an image viewer for them?And speaking of texture compression, I also have an ETC/BC codec which is limited in speed by how fast the PNG files can be decoded. There are some interesting observations if you look into it. For example, PNG has  different checksums to calculate, one at the zlib data stream level, and the second at the PNG data level. Another one is that zlib is slooow. The best you can do is replace zlib with zlib-ng, which provides some much-needed speed improvements. Yet how much better would it be to replace the zlib (deflate) compression in PNG files with a more modern compression algorithm, such as Zstd or LZ4? The PNG format even supports this directly with a “compression type” field in the header, but there’s only one value it can be set to. And it’s not going to change, because then you’d have to update every single program that can load a PNG file to support it. Which is hopeless.Some time ago, I submitted a bunch of patches for KDE that were largely ignored, which, let’s say, annoyed me a bit. I went off to write my own Wayland compositor. In the meantime, KDE got better enough to not bother me as much, and the exciting task of figuring out how to draw two textured triangles with Vulkan, potentially using two different GPU drivers at the same time, became rather tedious, so the project was shelved.But one of the things I had to do was write an image loader. To show the desktop background or the mouse cursor instead of just colored rectangles. Little things like that really do make a difference.Loading mouse cursors is not yet available in vv because it requires some special handling with animations, hot spots, and so on. Extending this very specialised implementation to the general image loading functionality requires some thought, and at the moment it’s hard to test if it would even work as intended, so there you have it.It’s still an interesting enough topic to talk about.To load Xcursor images, as used in the X Window System, you can use the Xcursor library, or one of its forks (?), like the wayland-cursor library. The downside of this approach is that the file format remains a bit of a mystery. I did not want it to be a mystery.It turned out that the Xcursor files are simple enough to parse on your own in about 20 lines of code. You need to read the file header, then the table of contents structure, and then individual images (more than one forming an animation), where the image data is RGBA 32-bit pixels.KDE recently started using SVG mouse cursors, which is a step in the right direction, but it’s also generally not related to the previous Xcursor file format.Looking at the wlroots implementation of cursor loading, I noticed some problems with Xcursor path handling and theme inheritance. It turns out that it’s trivial to reliably crash KDE by placing a cursor theme which inherits itself, in a known location. It was also possible to segfault any wlroots-based compositor by doing the same thing, but in a completely undocumented directory, because the path handling was kind of bad. The wlroots path problem seems to be now fixed, but only by accident, as the commit message describes it as a “cosmetic change”.The type of cursor determines what shape it should have. It can be the usual arrow pointer, or the hourglass-like busy indicator, the I-beam to indicate text entry, the directional arrows to indicate something is resizable. You get the idea. Hilariously enough, the currently agreed-upon set of cursor types (in Wayland, for example) is what was selected for the needs of web development.Before modern standardization, it was all a hodgepodge of mostly wrong ideas and bad implementations. Here’s what I think is the complete list of original X cursors, taken from some old book:This list may be a bit too symbolic here and there, so let’s take a look at more recent (well, 2003 recent) renderitions of some of the most absurd entries:Good? Okay, so how would you implement an X cursor theme on a modern system? Easy, just draw a bunch of cursors, then add a semi-random collection of symlinks on top of them, because nothing is standardized or documented. To show a “question mark” cursor, GNOME will refer to , but KDE might want . That’s just a simple example, but the list is much longer, and even includes some hashes, because why not.Probably not even a complete listHere’s how ridiculous all this is, summed up in one bug report:The Windows  cursor file is basically the  icon file, with some minor changes. It contains a header, an image directory (for animated cursors), and then the image data. The image data is a Windows Bitmap payload, so you can just use the existing BMP file loader you have.The BMP height is double the icon height, because the BMP payload contains both the image color data and the alpha mask. To make things worse, the color and alpha halves very likely will use different bit depths. Alpha is always one bit per pixel, and the bit depth just changes in the middle of a data stream.Then all the extra quirks come out that you have to take into account. For example, you really don’t want to touch the alpha channel when the color payload is 32 bpp. And the image data may be in the raw format, whatever that means, I surely don’t know. Or it could be a PNG file. Also, make sure that the RGB order is correct and that the image is not flipped vertically. And that you calculate the 4-byte aligned 1-bit stride correctly for cursors that are not power-of-two in size (for some rare 48 px cursors). And of course, there may be several versions of the bitmap data in a cursor, for different numbers of bits per pixel, or sizes, so choose the appropriate one! Clear as mud, right?Now you have the cursor image loaded, and you can view it at 1:1 scale, as on the left in the image below. But what happens when you scale the image up, as in the image on the right?The default Windows 95 cursorWhere are those annoying glowing pixels coming from? It turns out that this mouse pointer is actually repurposed from another type of cursor, with some pixels masked out. It does not matter when you draw the cursor 1:1, but with the filtering applied when the cursor is scaled, the colors bleed out, so you need to take care of that too.For what it’s worth, animated Windows cursors don’t need to store repeated frames more than once, unlike X cursors, which is nice. It is implemented by using an optional animation index table, which just references the actual image data.Windows cursors are stored in RIFF containers. RIFF is basically a collection of chunks, each consisting of a FourCC, a 32-bit data size, and the data payload. The byte order is the difference between the original Amiga’s IFF and Microsoft’s RIFF.This format was invented in 1985, and at the time it must have seemed like a fantastic thing. It was general enough to store any kind of data, it could be extended in the future, it was easy to parse and load. What’s there not to like?In practice, this is all a misfeature that should never happen.Having a generic container for everything doesn’t make sense. It’s a cool concept on paper, but when you have to write file loaders, it turns out that you have very specific needs, and none of those needs play well with “anything can happen lol”.Extending the data format may have been a nice idea in the 1980s, but we now know that file formats are eternal and you can’t just add or change something because all previously compatible loaders will break.Nothing is easy to load or parse when you technically have to create a table of contents of all the chunk types in the container and then load them all in the right order. I suspect that all files out there follow the unwritten agreement that the chunks should be present in parsing order, since doing anything more complicated would be way over the head for the memory-constrained machines of the 1980s. But that’s a strong , and there may be valid files that would require parsing chunks in a non-linear fashion.When I hooked up the loaded mouse cursors into my compositor, I noticed something was not right with how they looked. Then I started seeing it everywhere, including the Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck.After some debugging, the problem was narrowed down to only be happening on AMD GPUs, and Tom Forsyth provided a reasonable explanation.With the mouse cursors done, I moved on to implementing image loading functionality for the purpose of having a desktop background in my compositor. I wanted support for modern formats like AVIF or JPEG XL, and it all went fairly quickly and relatively smoothly. Include a library, follow the documentation, get an image, rinse and repeat.Back in June 2023, I did a little review of the various image format loading libraries available. (It turned out to be completely wrong, but let’s not spoil the surprise.)Call a function. You’re done.A bunch of functions you need to call in sequence, all presented as a neat and short program in the README. libpng, libjpegYou have to go through a narrated guide on what to call. You can get the work done, but you have to wade through super important stuff like low-quality decoding in case you want to run on Amiga.You get doxygen docs, so you don’t know where to start. The example program is your best bet, but it is convoluted and outputs each color channel as a float.The documentation is sometimes vague. To check if a file might be JPEG XL, you have to provide “the beginning of the file”. The function may fail and ask for more data. The documentation never specifies how much is needed. Reading the source code shows that it’s 12 bytes.The decoding process requires repeated calls to JxlDecoderProcessInput. The documentation lists several return codes you must handle. You start to build up a mental map of how all of this is supposed to work, and then you realize that some of it does not make any sense at all. Then you read the source code and find out that the decoding function can actually return a much wider variety of return codes, but the documentation does not tell you that.At this point, Aras chimed in with an interesting tidbit about libtiff.On April Fool’s Day 2024, I was looking for a good image viewer on Linux, and it turns out they are all bad in one way or another. For context, I’m running the Wayland desktop with fractional scaling, and that’s a minefield of sorts. Here’s an example.The default KDE image viewerThe image I’m looking at here is completely transparent, with only the four corners marked to indicate where it begins and ends. The checkerboard pattern is drawn in the background by the viewer to indicate, by convention, where the transparent area is. So why does it only cover part of the image? Because fractional scaling, or maybe just DPI scaling in general, I have not checked how it works with 200% scale.That may be a silly issue, but there’s also one that is much more impacting, as shown below.Close-up comparison of two images. Left: How gwenview displays the image. Right: How the image really looks likeThis is… what?! Is my image viewer lying to me? Is it not able to display an image correctly, the only functionality that needs to be 100% reliable in an image viewer?It can be hard to see exactly what is happening with an image that has random content, so I created a pixel checkerboard test pattern image and opened it in gwenview. This is what it displayed instead of a smooth surface:As for the other image viewers, it’s all a roll of the dice. One will depend on Qt being built with the right options, otherwise it won’t support JPEG XL. Another will not be able to load a 16k×16k PNG file, because who uses such absurdly large images? Yet another will pan the image at 5 FPS because somehow everything is software rendered.In other cases, support for various image formats will be lost over time due to maintenance overhead and because no one seems to care.I set out to write my own image viewer. I had already done the image loading, so only the output side needs to be handled. It would talk directly to the Wayland compositor, and use the appropriate protocol to handle fractional scaling in the right way to get a 1:1 pixel representation of images on the screen. I had previously done something similar for the Tracy Profiler, so it should be easy.Long story short, I can now view the images properly, but it uses Vulkan in not really the right way, and it requires a lot of polishing to get it where it should be, so I never released it.By the way, going with what seemed like a “smart” name that played on already existing abbreviations only resulted in me being confused as to whether the image codec was called AVIF or AFIV. Not recommended.Fast forward half a year, and I finally got annoyed enough with viu’s lack of support for modern image codecs to decide to do something of my own. How hard can it be? I have an image loader waiting to be used, and I just have to figure out how to display the pixels in the terminal.There is a Unicode block that contains block elements (yay for semantic overloading!). Here are some examples of these elements: █ ▇ ▆ ▅ ▄ ▃ ▂ ▁. Or maybe something like that: ░ ▒ ▓. You get the point, these are meant to make crude graphics possible.The most interesting block element is the one that’s half filled and half empty: ▄, or perhaps its negative counterpart: ▀. Typically, the font used in a terminal is more or less twice as high as it is wide, so by setting the foreground and background colors appropriately and using these half-block characters, you can get two very large squarish pixels.The pipeline is thus as follows: load the image, query the terminal size, resize the image to fit the terminal, print out the pixels by emitting ANSI color codes to set the two halves of the half-block characters, and this results in the following output:Unicode block elements imageIt may be worth noting that Chafa uses more of the block symbols, but the printouts it makes look ugly to me, like a JPEG image compressed with very low quality.The concept of setting terminal attributes dates back to the 1970s, and it really feels like a very old technology now. The nitty-gritty details can be read in the document XTerm Control Sequences, but the general gist is that you print a special sequence of bytes, and that changes something about how the text is displayed on the terminal.You’ve probably seen or even used things like “print  (or , or ) to set the color to red”, but how exactly does that work? Well, I don’t really know, because the Control Sequences document is way too complicated, and at the same time it avoids defining some stuff that was probably assumed to be common knowledge, but here’s my understanding of things.The  element is “escape code 27” (straight out of the ASCII table) and indicates the start of a control sequence you want to send. You have to literally print out 27 as a byte, which can be done either by writing it as , or , and probably some other way too.The  sequence is the Control Sequence Introducer, or . Supposedly it’s also 0x9b as a byte, but nobody uses it that way?The  Pₘ  sequence sets Character Attributes. Pₘ is any number of single parameters (Pₛ), separated by the  character. Example single parameters for character attributes are  to make the text bold,  to enable underline,  to set the foreground color to red, and so on.Thus, the above  ANSI sequence can be decoded as , which sets the foreground color to red. Similarly,  contains two different parameters, and it sets the foreground color to red and also enables text underlining.I think it’s safe to say that most people would assume that there are only 16 colors available on the terminal, more or less based on the 1981 CGA text mode color palette. The eight parameters  to  set the basic color to be used, and then you can also use the  bold parameter to make the selected color brighter.It is possible to use the more advanced 256-color mode in the terminal, where you choose the color from the palette of predefined colors. It still uses the Character Attribute ANSI sequence, but with the parameter set to  Pₛ, where Pₛ is the color index.Finally, there’s the true-color mode, where the parameter is  Pr  Pg  Pb. The parameter values in this command are, of course, the RGB color values.In vv I just assume that the terminal you have is capable of true-color display. This was standardized in 1994, so if the terminal of your choice doesn’t support it, I don’t really care.Sixel is another ancient technology, originally introduced in DECwriter IV in 1982. It was largely forgotten, only to be rediscovered recently. It is now more or less widely supported, but is lacking in some key areas. One of these is the limited number of available colors, which requires the use of dithering.To get the control sequences used to output sixel images, you can use the libsixel library. I use it as a fallback, but it’s not in really good shape, because I don’t really have the means to test it properly, and the library itself is largely undocumented.This is the main driver for outputting graphics in vv. It is relatively well documented, has support in the terminals I use, and the image data is both true-color and supports an alpha channel.The Kitty protocol is also very over-engineered, with a lot of seemingly unnecessary features. But if you only want to write an application that uses certain parts of the protocol, you don’t really need to worry about all the extra stuff you won’t be using.To send the RGBA pixel data to the terminal, you start with a header message that specifies the image size and some other image data details. Then you send the data, first compressing it with deflate, then encoding it with base64. The payload must be split into 4KB chunks.This results in a full color image being displayed in the terminal.As it turns out, the terminal control sequences are not a one-way road. The terminal may want to respond to your query. For example, if you send the  Send Device Attributes sequence, the terminal may respond with  to indicate that it is “VT100 with Advanced Video Option” (whatever that means).As a side note, you can use this query mechanism to determine if your terminal supports sixel images, or the kitty graphics protocol. I was very surprised to discover that the viu viewer also supports the kitty protocol, as it only printed sixel images on my Konsole terminal. It turns out that viu doesn’t do proper detection, and only enables the functionality if the  environment variable is set to . Which it isn’t on Konsole, even though Konsole supports the protocol. That’s not what the variable is for!Getting back to the topic, in order to be able to read the terminal’s response, you have to do some magic first. This code is just following what I found somewhere, and it seems to work as intended, so I didn’t dig into it too much.This will give you a terminal file descriptor to write to and read from. Since you don’t know if the terminal will respond, you should poll for data being available before reading (or you will deadlock). You should also use a sufficiently long timeout period, as you may be running on a slow ssh connection, and the data may appear after quite a delay. Yeah, this is really an ancient technology, not really suited for modern use cases.This is another true-color graphics display protocol that is available across many terminals now. It feels more like a  platform-specific hack, as it specifies the image data to be transferred as “any image format that macOS supports”.On the topic of “which protocol is the best”, I think I can recommend the typical FOSS SNAFU discussion. The only upside, compared to the Wayland situation, is that there’s already a good protocol implementation existing that I can just use, instead of waiting for these endless debates to finally figure out the most simple and obvious things.No, seriously, the idea that every terminal should implement support for every image format on its own, and do it in the right way (which we have yet to cover), is just something that will never happen.There are certain formats, such as OpenEXR, that contain image data that cannot be displayed on a SDR display. Consider the following sample EXR image, where the RGB color channels are displayed directly as they are stored in the image file (this is also how gwenview displays it):HDR image data viewed directlyOverall, the image is too dark. There are also large areas where the color is clipped, creating ugly oversaturated solid blobs of the same color. That’s the thing about HDR images. They can contain a lot of fine detail in dark areas. They can also contain very bright lights. None of this fits with what an SDR display can show. To view the image properly, the dynamic range must be compressed to what the monitor can display.The process of doing this is called tone mapping. There are many different algorithms for doing this, and choosing a particular one is a matter of taste. For vv, I went with the PBR Neutral operator, following Aras’ recommendation. The main reason for choosing it was that implementing it required only a little bit of math, instead of using a rather large lookup table. The other suggested tone mapping operators were Tony McMapface and AgX.It is important to note the way image data is specified in EXR files. The color values are in linear space, corresponding to measurements of the amount of photons from the given source in the given time. Double the number of photons, double the brightness, double the linear value.But this is not how humans perceive light (or sound). The response of our visual system is more like an exponential curve, and that’s another big topic of gamma correction that I’m not going to get into. Long story short, the linear color values (tone mapping works with linear values) have to be converted to the “exponential” sRGB color space in order to be displayed correctly by the monitor.With the tone mapping and the sRGB conversion, the image has a lot more detail, it is brighter in the dark areas, and the bright areas do not have their colors crushed.How important is it to handle the HDR images correctly? Why bother with HDR when you have the SDR monitor anyway? Isn’t it more of a movie thing anyway?Well, it is what you make it. These HDR movies have to be made somehow, and to properly view the HDR movie data or HDR still images, you need an HDR monitor and a proper HDR pipeline in your operating system. Or what if you want to watch an HDR video on youtube that works in the confines of your web browser? Or maybe the HDR content is embedded directly into the web page you are viewing, like below?HDR image as processed by your browserAs far as games are concerned, the 2005 release of Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was commonly known as the showcase of HDR rendering, and HDR has only become more widespread since then. You simply must render with high dynamic range to make things look realistic. The game’s rendered output is typically tone-mapped for display on an SDR monitor, but recent game releases allow you to bypass that step and deliver the HDR output directly to HDR monitors.The conversion from linear space to sRGB is commonly approximated with a $1/2.2$ power function. This is incorrect, the actual conversion is as follows:$$
L' = \begin{cases}
12.92 * L & \text{if $L < 0.0031308$,} \\
1.055 * L^{1/2.4} - 0.055 & \text{if $L >= 0.0031308$.}
\end{cases}
$$Have a look at the images below for the difference.sRGB 2.2 power function approximationProper sRGB transfer functionWhile the trees at the bottom of the image are easier to see in the approximated version, the camera noise and color banding are much more visible. The linear part of the transform was explicitly designed to minimize this. Also note how the correct transformation results in more saturated colors.I added support for vector images (SVG, PDF) in the second major release of vv. This required a different approach, because unlike raster images, which are loaded at their native size and then rescaled to fit the available space on the terminal, vector images have no innate size and should be rendered  the terminal size.The libraries for both formats (librsvg, poppler) are quite easy to use, and both use the cairo library to do the actual drawing of the vector data.The poppler library is licensed under the GPL. I don’t want my code to be GPLed.As everyone on the internet will tell you, if you use a GPL library, your program must be GPL as well. If you don’t want that, there is the LGPL license. This is common knowledge.Well, I have actually read the text of the GPL, and gave it some though. And I call bullshit.Conveying Modified Source Versions.You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. (…)This is the text that gives GPL the “viral” property. Makes sense, right? If you do a work (your program) based on the Program (in this case, some GPL library), you must also license the entire work (your program) under the GPL. When you link your program to the GPL library, you are surely basing your program on that library, right?That’s not how it works. Let’s go back to the license text.To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. (…)What is the title of section 5 again? “Conveying Modified Source Versions”. Do you copy or modify anything when you link? Yes, you do! You need to get the function prototypes from the headers, and you need to know the name of the library you are linking against!The problem is that these are statements of fact, and thus do not fall under copyright protection, which excludes them from being modifications. This is what the license text says. And it would be true even if the license did not explicitly say so.It’s interesting to think about what is actually copyrightable. This text provides some commentary on the subject. Or think about phone books. You cannot copyright a list of names and phone numbers, because those are just simple facts. However, if you were to assign some kind of rating to each person (e.g., on a nice-rude axis), then that rating would be copyrightable. Notably, the library headers will contain comments, and these do fall under the copyright. Whether this is significant, if all you do is machine processing which ignores the comments, is a matter to discuss for the lawyers.Google’s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair use of that material as a matter of lawAnyway, here is what vv does to link to the GPLed poppler library. This was done using only the documentation.This is probably a bit exaggerated in how evasive it is, but it works. Go and argue that vv is a poppler derivative when you don’t even need to have poppler installed to build the program. Explain how someone could be bound by a license to something they do not use.Finally, remember that the only legal text you are bound by (if at all) is the actual text of the GPL license. It does not matter what Stallman says he intended with the GPL, or what the GPL FAQ says should happen in some fantasy land.The common knowledge is that if you want to have an animated image, you use the GIF format. While this may no longer be true, as most websites now deliver animated images as MP4 videos, those same websites will lie to you and tell you that it’s GIF this or GIF that, because that’s what people understand as an animated image.It turns out that there are many other ways to deliver animated images. One example of this would be the APNG format, but I have never seen it out there in the wild. Another example is the WebP format. Unlike animated GIF or PNG images, which you can just load and get the first frame, animated WebP images will not load with the basic loader library. You have to use a different library, with a different API, all of which is not well documented, in order to even display anything in case of some WebP images. Considering how disjointed all of this is, and that there’s no overall design in sight, the animation feature was probably done as a cool and quick hack, and there was no one around with enough awareness to prevent it from happening.WebP is one of the I-frame image codecs. In a proper video codec, I-frames are used to represent a complete video frame without references to other frames. This allows you to seek in the video, or make sure the video quality is high enough when there’s a quick scene change. Video codecs will also use P and B frames to encode only the changes between the frames in the video, at a much lower bitrate cost. The downside of this delta compression is that these frames are based on the content of previous (or next) frames, so you can’t just quickly seek to any one of them, you have to decode all the previous frames, starting with an I-frame.In essence, someone thought “hey, we have all these advanced image codecs for keyframes in videos, why don’t we use them to encode images?” and WebP was created, based on the VP8 I-frame format. HEIC images use HEVC/H.265 I-frame encoding. And AVIF images use AV1 I-frame encoding. There’s also the VVC image format based on H.266, but adoption seems to be very limited as of now.To summarize, the WebP image format is based on parts of the VP8 video codec. The animation support in WebP is  done by adding parts that were removed in the process, removed from the video codec, from the very thing it is now trying to replicate. It is done by concatenating multiple WebP images together in some sort of container format. Try to see the logic in that.Kitty provides proper support for animating images in the terminal. You would probably think that the animation would have to be done by repeatedly sending the individual image frames that would replace what you had on display before. This isn’t the case with the Kitty protocol. Instead, you define an animation by providing all of its frames, and then start the animation loop. The animation will continue to play even if your program is stopped, as in the video below.One big practical drawback is that support for this type of animation is currently very limited. For example, the KDE Konsole or Ghostty don’t support it at all.At this point I thought that there are many ways to store the HDR image data, and the only format where I have complete control over the pipeline is OpenEXR. It would be nice to use the same algorithms for all formats instead of having a random selection of output processing.I started working on this with the RGBE or Radiance HDR format. The stb_image loader only does the linear to sRGB conversion if you want the typical 8 bits per color channel data, but it also provides a way to get the raw HDR floating point color values that you can put into the tone mapping pipeline. The results are shown below.Left: Linear to sRGB conversion by stb_image. Right: PBR Neutral tone mapping. Note the increased color saturation and detail in very bright areas.Then I looked for some HDR AVIF files, and this is what I got. The images were bland, desaturated, lacking contrast. They looked like this not only in my image viewer, but also in KDE Dolphin’s thumbnails, in Gwenview image viewer, in Okular PDF viewer, in GIMP. This is obviously wrong! Yet none of these fairly popular applications were able to get it right?At this point @rfnix@piaille.fr chimed in with talk about “PQ-encoded”, “ICC profile” or maybe “CICP/nclx” not being handled properly. And what is that anyway, why should I know, I just want to load the RGB pixels from an image and have them look good on the screen. Yeah, it doesn’t work that way, as it turns out. The simple API the libraries give you is a trap that will not output the correct data in the more advanced cases.Let’s ignore HDR completely for the time being. The color management problem applies just as well to standard SDR images, such as JPEGs. Take a look at the images below.Three color spaces. Left: Rec. 709, center: Rec. 2020, right: DCI-P3.If I were to show you just one of these pictures, any one of these pictures, you would say that it is a good picture. But each picture has different colors! Which one is right? How would you know? Maybe it doesn’t matter that much, the difference is quite small and only noticeable if you have another picture to compare it with…The Rec. 709 one is what it should look like. It defines the color primaries and white point used in sRGB that your browser and display expect. The conversion would be an identity in this case.And it really does matter a great deal, as you can see from the images below.Different color spaces. Left: Rec. 709, right: CIE XYZ.Not quite the same, right? But they are the same if you do your color management right!Okay, but wait, why does this thing even exist? Why would anyone save a photo in a different “color space”? What is a color space anyway? Aren’t you just going to show a picture on the screen anyway? To understand this, let’s take a look at the chromaticity diagram.The colored area represents all the colors that a human can see. The triangular shapes on the graph correspond to the color ranges (gamut) that can be represented by different color spaces. As you can see, the sRGB gamut is quite limited in what it can show. Have you ever wondered why photos of a vibrant sunset sky always look a bit bland compared to the real thing? This is why. The monitor simply cannot reproduce the right colors.Working with a non-sRGB gamut gives you more room to maneuver in image processing, even if the resulting image will be displayed on a sRGB display. Or maybe you have a fancy screen that can display all those extra colors? For example, if you are proofing images for printing, in which case you will need to target the CMYK color space, which has a significant area outside the sRGB gamut (but within the Adobe RGB gamut).As it turns out, the normalized 0 to 1 ranges of the red, green, and blue channels don’t mean anything by themselves. They are all defined in the context of a color space, and to get the right values to display on the screen, you need to convert these color values from the image color space to the display color space.The reason why “nobody” seemingly cares about this is the same as for gamma correction. This is computer graphics, and it’s all highly subjective (e.g., which digital camera manufacturer has the best color reproduction? Fight!), it’s not obviously wrong in most cases, and it requires some in-depth knowledge to even realize things are not correct.Here’s a much more dramatic example of what happens when you don’t care about color management. This is a test image that  things to look wrong, if handled incorrectly.Left: wrong, right: correctStill not enough? Here’s a nice example of what can happen even with the venerable JPEGs.JPEG with various color profile handling failsAnd it gets even better. Here’s a specially crafted single PNG image that can be displayed in 10 different ways, depending on the correctness and quirks of the image processing software.Which one is displayed properly?The color space definition is stored in images in the form of ICC color profiles. For the purpose of handling them, it is enough to know that they are just some binary objects of some size that you need to pass from the image to the color management library via some function calls.To implement color management in vv I decided to use the Little CMS library. It’s quite easy to use, and already a dependency for a lot of software. First you need to create input and output color profiles, for example by using  to load an ICC color profile embedded in the image and  to create a sRGB profile for display on the screen. Then you use both profiles to create a transform with , which can be applied to pixel data with . The transform seems to be thread-safe, and the input and output buffers can be the same (if the data types match). At least I haven’t had any problems using it in such a configuration.Okay, so those not-quite-right-looking HDR images I showed you earlier are probably in some kind of HDR color space that needs to be handled properly, and that’s it, right?Well, no, not really. That would be a reasonable assumption, but instead we have to write what feels like half of a video codec processing pipeline. The image above was retrieved by calling the following libheif function, where we request the image to be decoded as RGB because that’s what we want to display on the screen in the end. Another reasonable assumption would be that the library will return an image that looks correct in such a case.This gives us data that is 8 bits per channel, which is not what we want for an HDR image. It is possible to get the 16-bit RGB data with the heif_chroma_interleaved_RRGGBBAA_LE enum value, but it is all horrible and wrong and I can’t even remember the details of what I did to try to get it to work. Let’s not talk about it.The other available option is to request . Let’s see what it is.We need to start with some definitions that can often be quite confusing. As mentioned earlier, we can measure the amount of photons hitting, say, the light-sensitive “pixels” of a camera. This linear measure is called  and is expressed in nits, or candelas per square meter. However, this measure is not really useful when we need to encode things as an electrical signal, which is just a voltage, such as between 0V and 5V. So for practical applications, the  is used, denoted as . Its value is calculated by dividing the luminance value by the maximum expected value of luminance, and it results in a 0 to 1 range that can be easily encoded.If we have a color image, we can calculate the relative luminance of its pixels (i.e., convert it to grayscale) by assigning certain weights to the color channels, corresponding to how humans perceive color, and summing them. For correct results, the color channel values should be linear, not gamma compressed. Here are the weights as defined in Rec. 709 (other standards may use different weights):$$
Y = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B
$$For the sake of practicality, and because getting things exactly right isn’t always the first priority, there is also , denoted as . This is the weighted sum (the coefficients are the same as for relative luminance) of the gamma-compressed color channels. In reality, the terms luma and luminance are often mixed up, even in the specialist literature, and Y’ is often written simply as Y.The television signal was originally transmitted as a series of black and white images. Expanding the signal to include color, while maintaining compatibility with existing TV sets, required some smart thinking.To make a long story short, the already existing black and white luma signal was supplemented with two color difference channels, calculated as follows:$$
U = B' - Y' \\
V = R' - Y'
$$As you probably figured out, the ’ is an indication of gamma compression. The exact formula is a little bit different, and there are a couple of coefficients in there that I have left out, but none of that is important here.This encoding is known as Y’UV, or simply YUV, and you can see what it looks like in the image below.YUV channel decomposition. Left to right: original picture, Y channel, U channel, V channel.The human visual system is much more sensitive to brightness changes than to color changes, so it was possible to reduce the resolution of the color difference channels to reduce bandwidth requirements. This is known as chroma subsampling.Chroma subsampling can be used in many different places. Image or video compression is one such place. Displaying on a TV or monitor is another. If your display subsamples the color signal, you probably will not see the degradation in photos or movies, because they may already have been subsampled, and otherwise the color distribution would be smoothed over many pixels. But if you were to look at a typical computer screen with a lot of text or fine iconography in such a display configuration, you would immediately notice that everything looks wrong. There are some examples of this on the RTINGS web site.The YUV encoded image can be converted back to RGB using an inverse transform.This is another color image encoding, but it is very similar to YUV. Technically it should be called Y’CbCr, but nobody cares, and you might as well encounter it as YCC, or simply YUV.  Just like YUV, YCbCr consists of the luma channel and two color channels that can be subsampled.YCbCr channel decomposition. Left to right: original picture, Y channel, Cb channel, Cr channel.As mentioned earlier, libheif gives us the option to load the image with the  option, and this is the color space we get. Unlike the RGB output, where the color channels are interleaved together in the RGBA pattern, YUV/YCbCr is a planar format, where each channel is stored disjointly in memory. This sort of makes sense, because chroma may be subsampled, and there would be no way to interleave such color planes. Well, at least we can request libheif to always return the planes as 4:4:4, even if they are subsampled in the image.The video image codecs store the plane values as 8, 10, or 12 bit integer values which can be normalized to 0 to 1 range floating point values for further processing. And while we’re at it, there’s another quirk to take care of.While in digital signal processing the full signal range, e.g. 0 to 255 in the case of 8 bits, is not a problem, things are different in the analog world. Using the full range of values would cause the signal to overshoot or undershoot the allowable signal levels (see Gibbs phenomenon), so the range is limited by scaling and offsetting the Y to the 16 to 235 range and the UV to the 16 to 240 range. In order to perform the normalization correctly, it is necessary to check whether the image uses the full range or the limited range, and adjust accordingly if necessary.We discussed color profiles earlier, and libheif gives you the ability to query for an ICC color profile. But it also has a function to query for an nclx color profile. So which one should you use? Are the two related in any way? Can you use one instead of the other? Little CMS has no support for nclx, so how do you use it? The documentation is very light on this.As it turns out, an image can have none of these, one of these, or both at the same time. And you have to deal with them accordingly, in different ways, even when they overlap.We already covered the ICC profile, but what is an nclx profile? Let’s take a look at the corresponding libheif struct (with some fields omitted):The  indicates whether the YUV values are limited or full range. Notably, if the flag is not present (i.e. if there is no nclx profile), the value of the flag is assumed to be .The  field rings a bell, but why is it an enum? Let’s see what it looks like.Oh my… What do you even do with this? The answer can be found in the H.273 specification document (commonly known as “coding-independent code points”, or CICP).ITU-T H.273 (V4) (07/2024), 8.1 Colour primariesAh, so these are the color primaries coordinates for the red, green, and blue channels, along with the white point location. These are given in xy coordinates, just like in the chromaticity diagram shown earlier. It looks simple now! You can just drop this into the color management library and get a color profile from it.Okay, but the color transformation is in RGB, yet we still have the YCbCr values, don’t we? How do we convert these, is there some sort of function to handle this? To know how to perform the YCbCr to RGB transformation, we need to take a look at the  field, which can have the following values:Again, the correct way to handle all these options is explained in the H.273 specification. It is a very dense, math-heavy section that spans six pages, which I will spare you from looking at. And most of it isn’t even needed at all, because only a few of these values are used in practice, see the table below.ITU-T Series H Supplement 19Knowing this secret sauce makes things simple again. The 0 value indicates that the YCbCr values are actually GBR, and only require a channel swap to get RGB. The 1, 5, 6, and 9 values use the same equation, differing only in the coefficients used for multiplication. The 14 value does not operate in the YCbCr color space and is therefore irrelevant for libheif.The last thing to cover in the nclx profile are the .In practice, the options to cover are value 13, which is just the linear to sRGB transfer function we covered earlier, and the Perceptual Quantize (16) and Hybrid Log-Gamma (18) transfer functions used for HDR images.The reason for these HDR transfer functions to exist is the amount of bits available. While the OpenEXR format can simply store the linear color values as 32-bit or 16-bit (IEEE 754-2008 half-precision) floating point numbers, the video codec formats only have 10 or 12 integer bits to represent the dynamic range, and as we already know, the human visual system’s response to light stimulus is exponential. This does not play well with the evenly spaced integer values.The PQ transfer function, as the name implies, is based on the characteristics of human perception. It distributes the available integer values over a wide dynamic range, scaling from 0.0001 nits to 10000 nits. The same function is used to transfer each of the color channels.The HLG transfer function is designed to be backwards compatible with SDR displays by combining an SDR gamma curve with an HDR logarithmic curve for color values above 1.0. The HDR images I found were all using the PQ characteristic, so the HLG support in vv is probably not implemented the right way. But what can you do if you can’t test it properly?Going through my test images, I noticed that one of them was a bit odd. It did not have the nclx profile, and according to the AVIF CICP spec, the default matrix coefficient should be 6, or Rec. 601. However, when inspecting the image with  or , the reported coefficient was 1, or Rec. 709. How can this be?When you load the image with libheif, you get the image handle, on which you can call the heif_image_handle_get_nclx_color_profile() function to get the nclx profile. However, in some cases the profile may only be available after decoding the image, with the heif_image_get_nclx_color_profile() function. So you have to take this into account.To recap, the HDR processing pipeline with libheif is as follows:Convert the integer plane values to floating point, possibly taking into account the limited range adjustment,Perform the conversion from YCbCr to RGB, following the matrix coefficients from the nclx profile,Do the color management, either by loading the ICC profile or by using the values from the nclx profile,Linearize the color values by applying the nclx transfer function,Convert from linear color space to sRGB.That’s certainly something, isn’t it? But how does it look now? Check out the picture below to see how much better it is.More examples can be seen in the following post.Having things render correctly is very nice, but it also made everything a bit slow. One of my test images a resolution of 9504×6336 and it took over 8 seconds to load. This was unacceptable.The most obvious thing to do was to parallelize the image processing. All the calculations I do are local to a single pixel and don’t depend on the neighbors, so it should be embarrassingly parallelizable.To manage the jobs, I used my  class that I developed while working on etcpak. It is very simple and had better CPU usage than the other job dispatchers I compared it to a decade ago.I started by parallelizing each of the processing steps separately to follow the serial way of doing things. Then, after a bit of profiling, I realized that this was quite inefficient. The test image I used was 9504 * 6336 * 4 channels * 4 bytes = 918 MB. So the parallelized color management function had to load that 918 MB, process it, and store the 918 MB back into memory. Then the parallelized transfer function had to load the 918 MB again, do the necessary math, and store the 918 MB again. And so on. No wonder the profiler showed that half of the execution time was in the memory instructions, since everything had to go through RAM all the time.In order to make this better, I have completely changed the way the loader works. The parallelization is now done at the top level, and each job starts by loading a chunk of YCbCr data, then does all the necessary processing in a small temporary buffer, step by step, and finally writes the finished image section to the output bitmap. The chunks are small enough to fit into the cache, and the memory instructions no longer flare up when profiling.Going wide with calculations is another obvious thing to do. My compiler (clang) was already nice enough to vectorize the integer to float YCbCr conversion, along with the YCbCr to RGB routine. Using gcc may not give you the same results, but I don’t really want to bother doing something that has already been done for me.Since, for , we are still largely tied to the 2003 CPU architecture that only supports SSE2, vv is built with the  compiler option to be able to use SIMD at all. The other choice is to implement dynamic dispatch, so that a generically built binary can use features from more advanced architecture levels, depending on what the CPU supports. Bur I  don’t want to make the code more complicated just because the whole industry is afraid to stop supporting CPUs released before 2013, when Haswell with AVX2 and FMA became available.The PQ function requires an implementation of the  function to be available. Implementing it for wide processing requires some complex math that I did not want to deal with. That’s something that should be readily available in some sort of a SIMD math library, right?Replacing the series of mul + add instructions with fma (fused multiply-add) tipped the scales in favor of SIMD, albeit slightly. Extending the implementation to AVX2 gave the expected 2× speedup, but the AVX512 version produced artifacts. I later found out that I somehow missed the correct rounding option when reading the SIMD documentation and used the wrong one, resulting in NaN output. But it didn’t matter. I was not happy with the performance of that version.At this point, Aras chimed in again and recommended another implementation. I wrote a bit of code based on it, and somehow managed to make the same rounding option mistake again, which produced a rather psychedelic image. But I did not know that at that time.“Can you tell I took something” memeAt this point, I reluctantly decided that maybe it’s time to stop trying random code from the web, and maybe I should actually understand how this should work. This is what I found out before I realized what the real problem was.First, the power function can be expressed as a combination of  and  functions. This has been already clear from prior research and from reading the SIMD implementations.$$
x^{y} = e^{y * \ln x}
$$The first implementation I talked about above used this formula and stuck to using $e$ as the base. This unfortunate decision required some unnecessary back and forth transformations of the numbers. The exponential function and the logarithm can actually be combined together using any base, so the equation can be rewritten as:$$
x^{y} = 2^{y * \log_2 x}
$$This is important when we consider how IEEE 754 floating-point numbers are encoded. To recap, a 32-bit float consists of (counting from the oldest bit):And the number value is calculated as follows.$$
-1^S * 1.M * 2^{E-127}
$$Now let’s try to make some sense of this. The sign bit is irrelevant for us, the color values are never negative. Writing the exponent as $E-127$ is only necessary to decode the binary encoding of the number, which we will simplify to just $E$, assuming it is properly biased. The mantissa value written as $1.M$ is actually always in the 1 to 2 range. When this 1 to 2 range is multiplied by $2^E$, the range changes to, for example, 0.5 to 1, or 2 to 4, and so on.With this knowledge in hand, let’s take a look at another mathematical identity.$$
\log (a*b) = \log a + \log b
$$And guess what, the floating point numbers follow the $a*b$ formula. Let’s put it into the equation.$$
\log_2 (1.M * 2^E) = \log_2 1.M + \log_2 2^E
$$Which can be simplified as follows.$$
\log_2 (1.M * 2^E) = \log_2 1.M + E
$$As it turns out, with base 2, all we have to do is calculate the logarithm of the mantissa and add the value of the exponent to get the logarithm of the whole floating-point number. And since the mantissa will always be in the range 1 to 2 (or 0.5 to 1 if the exponent is biased), we can approximate its logarithm quite accurately with a polynomial function.The exponential function is also approximated by a polynomial and some similar tricks, but I have not had a close look at the implementation details.Once the power function was taken care of, implementing the PQ transform as a SIMD function was fairly straightforward. The scalar version of the code took 1.56 s to run. The SSE 4.1 + FMA version took only 528 ms, which is about a 3× speedup. Nice!Widening the SIMD code was trivial because there is no crosstalk between lanes, which would otherwise require costly shuffles and permutes. The AVX2 version ran at 276 ms, while the AVX512 version required only 145 ms.Finally, by enabling parallelization, which we have already discussed, the run time was further reduced to a mere 31 ms. That’s only 2% of the original 1.56 seconds!Both the PBR Neutral operator and the linear to sRGB transfer function use conditional execution. Since both functions operate on packs of 4, 8, or even 16 values, I simply compute both sides of the condition and then merge the results depending on the outcome of the pipelineable comparison operation.Before the optimizations the test image took more than 8 seconds to load. With the SIMD code paths and multithreading in place, the same image can be loaded in just 0.8 seconds.Trace of program executionDecoding of YCbCr planes with libheif is 248 ms. The YCbCr packing, normalization, color management, PQ transfer, and tone mapping pipeline is 355 ms. Resizing the image is 111 ms. Compression with zlib is 19 ms. Writing to the terminal is 127 ms.It turns out that viewing a random cat picture from the internet is quite an involved process. The amount of things you have to cover makes you quite interdisciplinary.On the other hand, it’s not  hard. The original implementation of the loaders for my compositor took me maybe two or three days. It took me about 5 days to release the first version of vv, basically starting from scratch, with only the image loader library available, which I even extended with support for OpenEXR, TIFF and RAW images, along with tone mapping during those 5 days.And yet I still can’t open a BC or ETC texture in virtually any other image viewer, somehow.The next steps for vv would be to check the color management pipeline for correctness. Support for color profiles will need to be added to a lot of formats that still do not have it. I may have already announced that the JPEG XL loader supports it correctly, but it turns out that the code paths are not executed. It may need a similar treatment to libheif. Oh well.Loading animated GIFs would be nice, but the libgif interface looks like it was designed for 16-bit computers and their limitations. And it probably was. Mouse cursors need to be ported to the general image loader interface. Adding support for Windows .ico icons would also be nice.I will most likely want to add support for a few more tone mapping operators.Then maybe do some work on the graphical viewer to make it usable and reliable enough. After all, vv is just a thin wrapper over the image loading library, which does all the heavy lifting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Divers recover Phoenician shipwreck that sank 2.6k years ago off coast of Spain</title><link>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/divers-recover-ancient-shipwreck-that-sank-2600-years-ago-off-the-coast-of-spain-180985778/</link><author>bookofjoe</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:25:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Archaeologists have raised a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from the waters near southeastern Spain.Divers initially located the vessel in 1994, according to CBS News’ Emily Mae Czachor. The 27-foot-long wreck, which had been carrying a load of lead ingots when it sank, was discovered near the town of Mazarrón.Known as the , the ship was located just six feet beneath the surface of the Mediterranean, roughly 200 feet away from a beach called Playa de la Isla. It was covered in sand, which helped keep it hidden for centuries.More recently, changes along the coastline—including coastal construction and shifting sea currents—made the wreck site more vulnerable.“The wreckage can no longer remain where it is because its sand protection is now disappearing,” said Carlos de Juan, an archaeologist at the University of Valencia who led the excavation project, in a July 2024 statement. “The wreckage has survived for centuries, but now it is time to roll up our sleeves and ensure that we can continue to enjoy this asset of cultural interest.”For many years, the wreck had been covered by a protective metal box. But a group of experts who studied the wreck site between 2017 and 2019 found that the metal box was sinking and threatened to crush the shipwreck.In the summer of 2023, archaeologists began to formulate a plan to raise the shipwreck from the seafloor. They spent 560 hours diving at the wreck site to make detailed diagrams of its many cracks and fissures.“It is more reasonable to rescue the ship, treat it and exhibit it in a museum for people to enjoy it, rather than worrying every time a big storm arrives,” de Juan told Reuters’ Emma Pinedo in June 2023.Between September and November 2024, a team of 14 divers carefully brought the wooden shipwreck to the surface, piece by piece. Now, those fragments are going to a lab at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology in Cartagena for conservation and reconstruction. That work is expected to take at least four years, reports ’ Virginia Vadillo.To preserve the ship, experts will start by removing the salt from each of the pieces, per . Next, they will apply resins to help fill in some of the places where the wood has rotted away. They will then freeze-dry the pieces before reassembling the shipArchaeologists think the ship belonged to the Phoenicians, a group of maritime traders and merchants who inhabited the eastern Mediterranean coast from around 1500 to 300 B.C.E.is one of the few Phoenician-era shipwrecks that’s still largely intact, and it could offer new insights into Phoenician shipbuilding techniques and culture, the archaeologists say.“It will tell us what types of wood were used to build the boat, where it was built, what navigation was like at the time, the degradation processes of the wood, the contamination that may have occurred in shallow waters,” said Agustín Díez, a historian at the University of Valencia who also worked on the project, in the statement.Another shipwreck, called the was discovered in the same area off the coast of southeastern Spain in 1993. Archaeologists raised it from the water two years later. After many years of conservation work, the ship went on display at the National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>William Dembski - What Can Science Say About God?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrwF0lX7HQs</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 20:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow us on Instagram for daily news, announcements, and exciting updates: https://shorturl.at/p2IhM

	Director-writer David Lynch, who radicalized American film with with a dark, surrealistic artistic vision in films like “Blue Velvet” and “Mulholland Drive” and network television with “Twin Peaks,” has died. He was 78.
	Lynch revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with emphysema after a lifetime of smoking, and would likely not be able to leave his house to direct any longer. His family announced his death in a Facebook post, writing, “There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.'”
	The “Twin Peaks” TV show and films such as “Blue Velvet,” “Lost Highway” and “Mulholland Drive” melded elements of horror, film noir, the whodunit and classical European surrealism. Lynch wove tales, not unlike those of his Spanish predecessor Luis Bunuel, which proceeded with their own impenetrable logic.

	
	A four-time Oscar nominee, Lynch received an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2020.
	After years spent as a painter and a maker of short animated and live action films, Lynch burst onto the scene with his 1977 feature debut “Eraserhead,” a horrific, black-humored work that became a disturbing fixture on the midnight movie circuit. His outré and uncompromising style quickly won the attention of the Hollywood and international movie-making establishment.
	He was hired by Mel Brooks’ production company to write and direct “The Elephant Man,” a deeply affecting drama about a horrifically deformed sideshow freak in Victorian England who became a national celebrity. The feature captured eight Academy Award nominations, including Lynch’s first for best director.
	He found less success with his 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling science fiction novel “Dune.” The production, made on a budget of $40 million during an arduous three-year shoot, was a colossal box office flop.
	However, Lynch rebounded from the disaster with two films that defined his mature style: “Blue Velvet” (1986), a frightening hellride through the psychosexual underbelly of a small American town, and the sexed-up, violent road movie “Wild at Heart” (1990), which was honored with the Cannes Film Festival’s Palme d’Or.
	In 1990, he revolutionized American episodic TV with “Twin Peaks,” a series he created with writer Mark Frost. With action springing from the investigation of a high school girl’s mysterious murder in a Washington lumber mill town, the weekly ABC show plumbed disquieting, theretofore taboo subject matter and made the inexplicable a fixture of modern narrative television.

	
	A major hit in its first season, “Twin Peaks” lost its momentum and ultimately its audience in year two. However, it spawned a feature-length prequel, 1992’s over-the-top “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”; 25 years later, the ongoing affection of a loyal cult of viewers sparked a limited-run third season for Showtime that picked up where the second season left off.
	Later in his career, in such features as “Lost Highway” (1997), “Mulholland Drive” (which won him the best director award at Cannes in 2001) and “Inland Empire” (2006), Lynch flexed a super-heated style that pivoted on plots emphasizing doubled personalities, unexplained transformations and shocking acts of violence. The quiet yet quirky “The Straight Story” (1999) harkened back to the more reserved emotional pull of “The Elephant Man.”
	The director himself was consistently reticent about sorting the meaning of his work for his viewers. In the book-length collection of interviews “Lynch On Lynch” (2005), he addressed the enigmatic core of his work with writer Chris Rodley.
	“Well,” Lynch said, “imagine if you did find a book of riddles, and you could start unraveling them, but they were really complicated. Mysteries would become apparent and thrill you. We all find this book of riddles and it’s just what’s going on. And you can figure them out. The problem is, you figure them out inside yourself, and even if you told somebody, they wouldn’t believe you or understand it in the same way you do.”
	In addition to his honorary Oscar, Lynch’s one-of-a-kind career was acknowledged by a special award (shared with his frequent star Laura Dern) at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards and a Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival.
	He was born Jan. 20, 1946, in Missoula, Montana. His father was a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, and his peripatetic family lived in the plains states, the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast before settling in Alexandria, Virginia, where Lynch attended high school.
	An indifferent student, Lynch focused on painting. A one-year stay at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and an abortive trip to Europe with his friend Jack Fisk (later a noted Hollywood production designer) were succeeded by his enrollment at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1965.

	
	Living in a forbidding Philly neighborhood with his first wife and infant daughter Jennifer (later a director herself), Lynch began to dabble in film, directing the animated shorts “Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)” and “The Alphabet” (1968).
	“The Grandmother” (1970), a combination of animation and live action, was filmed with money obtained from a grant by the newly founded American Film Institute. In 1971, Lynch moved to Los Angeles to study filmmaking at the AFI’s Conservatory for Advanced Film Studies, headquartered in the former Doheny mansion in Beverly Hills.
	Beginning in 1972, Lynch began work on a feature at the AFI. Inspired by his bleak years as a print engraver and struggling artist in Philadelphia, a 21-page initial script began to take shape; Lynch would later say he had no memory of writing it. Over the course of the next five years, he made the film with several collaborators who would remain constants in his career, including sound designer Alan Splet, cinematographer Frederick Elmes and actor Jack Nance.
	Shot laboriously, cheaply and on the fly for five years, “Eraserhead” was released by indie distributor Libra Films International in 1977. The disquieting black-and-white film followed the psychological descent of its maladroit hero Henry Spencer (Nance) after the birth of his monstrously malformed baby.
	Critics were decidedly alarmed by the picture when it premiered at L.A.’s Filmex in 1977, but it took on a commercial life of its own when Libra opened the picture at midnight screenings in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Lynch would frequently appear at L.A. screenings, admonishing his mystified audiences, “Don’t ask about the baby.”
	One enthusiastic viewer at a midnight show at L.A.’s Nuart Theatre was Stuart Cornfeld, a producer at Mel Brooks’ Brooksfilms. He urged Brooks to employ Lynch, and, after viewing “Eraserhead,” Brooks offered the director a job.
	For his project, Lynch took on the story of John Merrick, whose sensational life story had already inspired Bernard Pomerance’s hit 1977 play. The film version of “The Elephant Man” was an entirely new enterprise, co-written by Lynch and starring a heavily made-up John Hurt as the sensitive Merrick, Anthony Hopkins as the London Hospital surgeon who became his guardian, and Brooks’ wife Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic West End stage star.

	
	“The Elephant Man” had a powerful emotional impact, and became a box office and critical hit; Lynch received Oscar nods as best director and for best adapted screenplay, with the film also taking a nomination for best picture. The triumph led to a multiple-picture deal with Dino Di Laurentiis.
	The sprawling space opera “Dune,” about galactic family dynasties warring over possession of a space-travel “spice” mined on a desert planet, had already defeated projected adaptations by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott when Lynch took on the material.
	Filmed laboriously on Mexican soundstages with an enormous international cast, “Dune” sported an unusual Flash Gordon-meets-Antonio Gaudi production design, a memorable gallery of demented Lynchian villains and the director’s trademark amniotic visuals.
	The picture satisfied no one: Both audiences attuned to the boisterous heroics of “Star Wars” and impatient critics rejected Lynch’s contorted, confusing and harshly digested reading of Herbert’s novel, and the film tanked on arrival. Lynch later told Chris Rodley that at the conclusion of the ordeal, “I was almost dead. Almost dead!”
	However, Lynch’s second film for De Laurentiis defined the contours of his mature style. “Blue Velvet” starred Kyle McLachlan, who had played the messianic hero of “Dune,” as a small-town boy who is plunged into a whirlpool of sexual violence, murder and sadomasochism.
	Featuring a potent cast that included Isabella Rossellini (with whom Lynch became involved romantically), Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell and, most notably, Dennis Hopper as its deranged, out-of-control villain, “Blue Velvet” polarized critics, but it cemented Lynch’s reputation as a fearless and daring film author. The film was the start of his collaboration with composer Angelo Badalamenti.
	Four years later, the Lynch style was brought to the small screen with “Twin Peaks.” Starring McLachlan as eccentric FBI agent Dale Cooper, the series used the investigation of the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer as a springboard into a swirling narrative vortex involving sexual intrigue, drug addiction, prostitution, madness and demonic possession. TV audiences tuned in to track the mystery and remained for the series’ complexly interwoven characters and perverse, at times supernatural plot twists.

	
	The show’s first season scored 14 Emmy nominations, including nods for Lynch for writing and directing the pilot, but declining ratings after the drawn-out revelation of Palmer’s killer and Lynch’s diminishing participation due to production of a new feature led to a cliffhanging wrap-up at the end of season two.
	However, the “Twin Peaks” saga had legs. Actress Sheryl Lee was brought back from the dead to play Laura Palmer in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” which tracked the fateful last week of Palmer’s life in lurid, screaming detail. And Showtime cable audiences were baffled anew by 2017’s much-belated third season, which reunited McLachlan and several members of the original cast.
	The truest legacy of “Twin Peaks” may have been its impact on the development of unusual long-form episodic series. Successors ranging from “Wild Palms” to “True Detective” all bore Lynch’s distinctive stylistic fingerprints.
	Lynch’s first feature after “Twin Peaks,” 1990’s “Wild at Heart,” was an oddball exodus, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, in which an Elvis-fixated ex-con (Nicolas Cage) and his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Laura Dern) are pursued by the murderous minions of the girl’s jealous mother (Dern’s own mother Diane Ladd). Domestic reaction was mixed to the gory, sexually frank mix of “Detour” and “The Wizard of Oz,” but the Cannes jury was wowed.
	Lynch’s association with Gifford continued with “Lost Highway,” for which the two collaborated on an original screenplay. A doppelganger murder mystery that foreshadowed “Mulholland Drive,” the disquieting, brutally effective thriller starred Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty and Patricia Arquette as the players in a homicidal foursome.
	After spending most of the decade on the far side of narrative coherence, Lynch came back down to earth with “The Straight Story,” the first feature in which he took no hand in writing. In the incongruously Disney-distributed picture, based on a true story, Richard Farnsworth starred as an Iowa man who drives from Iowa to Wisconsin on a power mower to visit his seriously ill brother.
	Though not a major hit, the film was critically well received, and proved to Lynch’s naysayers that he was capable of bringing life to material that was not extravagantly outrageous. Farnsworth received an Oscar nomination for his performance; the veteran actor and stunt man, who was suffering from terminal prostate cancer during the production of the film, died by suicide in 2000.

	
	An enlarged version of a prospective pilot for a new TV series became what may have been Lynch’s most widely acclaimed film, and a defining summation of the filmmaker’s themes and narrative obsessions.
	“Mulholland Drive” served a darkly satirical comment on the ways of Hollywood in the story of a young actress (Naomi Watts) whose relationship with an amnesiac stranger (Laura Elena Harring) becomes a hall-of-mirrors story of manipulation, betrayal and suicide. Lynch was nominated for a 2002 best director Oscar.
	Some of the same themes came to the fore in “Inland Empire,” Lynch’s first film to be shot entirely on digital video, with Laura Dern starring as an on-the-skids actress involved in typical Lynchian psychic disorder. Owing to its format, still a relative rarity theatrically in 2007, the three-hour feature was little seen after its 2007 premiere at the Venice Film Festival.
	In 2022, he appeared as John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s “The Fablemans,” and also provided the voice of the mad scientist in “Robot Chicken.”
	Beyond his work in film and TV, Lynch exhibited his paintings internationally and issued many solo and collaborative albums of music. He contributed a weekly comic strip, “The Angriest Dog in the World,” to the alternative weekly the Los Angeles Reader for eight years. His wry, deadpan weather reports were aired daily on the L.A. rock station Indie 103.1 for several years and continued on social media.
	A devotee of transcendental meditation from the 1970s on, he established his David Lynch Foundation to promote the Eastern practice, and enlisted such stars as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Donovan for fund-raising concerts.
	Despite persistent rumors of new feature and TV projects after “Twin Peaks” came to an end in 2017, Lynch focused on making music videos and composing music with collaborators including Christabell. He offered his name to the David Lynch Graduate School of Cinematic Arts at Maharishi University and a line of coffee beans and designed Silencio nightclubs in Paris and New York. 
	Lynch was married four times. He is survived by two daughters and two sons.
	The first reference to David Lynch in  came in the Dec. 6, 1968, edition of , in a story noting that he had received a $5,000 grant from the American Film Institute for his short film “The Grandmother.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Last Tsar: How The Communists Won</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcS056KiJa0</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For three hundred years Russia was ruled by one family: the Romanovs.

We’ve been working on it since last year and recently released v2.0 with a ton of new features and major API overhaul.Durable execution means persisting the execution state of your program while it runs, so if it is ever interrupted or crashes, it automatically resumes from where it left off.Durable execution is useful for a lot of things:- Orchestrating long-running or business-critical workflows so they seamlessly recover from any failure.- Running reliable background jobs with no timeouts.- Processing incoming events (e.g. from Kafka) exactly once- Running a fault-tolerant distributed task queue- Running a reliable cron scheduler- Operating an AI agent, or anything that connects to an unreliable or non-deterministic API.What’s unique about DBOS’s take on durable execution (compared to, say, Temporal) is that it’s implemented in a lightweight library that’s totally backed by Postgres. All you have to do to use DBOS is “npm install” it and annotate your program with decorators. The decorators store your program’s execution state in Postgres as it runs and recover it if it crashes. There are no other dependencies you have to manage, no separate workflow server–just your program and Postgres.One big advantage of this approach is that you can add DBOS to ANY TypeScript application–it’s just a library. For example, you can use DBOS to add reliable background jobs or cron scheduling or queues to your Next.js app with no external dependencies except Postgres.Also, because it’s all in Postgres, you get all the tooling you’re familiar with: backups, GUIs, CLI tools–it all just works.Want to try DBOS out?  Initialize a starter app with:    npx @dbos-inc/create -t dbos-node-starter

Then build and start your app with:    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run start

Also check out the docs: https://docs.dbos.dev/We'd love to hear what you think! We’ll be in the comments for the rest of the day to answer any questions you may have.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cambodia - How microcredit is making the world&apos;s poor even poorer | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-VOjZA_Rz0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 17:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microcredits for the world's poor have long been considered the ideal way to combat poverty. But this film documents a bleak scenario -- in which microcredits have destroyed entire families. Over-indebtedness has driven some recipients to suicide.

Expectations were high. When Muhammad Yunus, the "banker to the poor” and founder of the Grameen Bank for microfinance in Bangladesh, received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2006, it was clear to many that the principle of helping people to help themselves would lift many out of poverty. 

From the 1980s to the early 2000s, microcredits were seen as one of the best tools for combating poverty. However, the loans, which were initially seen as a positive inflow of liquidity, quickly led to further financial obligations for many families. After all, interest had to be paid on these loans. Illegal lenders stepped in. The pressure on families became unbearable, leading to the sale of land, migration, the break-up of families and ultimately even suicide.

The film tells the stories of three Cambodian families. Along the way, it debunks the myth of microfinance as a tool that truly helps the poor. Told through the eyes of the protagonists and through their personal experiences, this film highlights the hardships faced by so many Cambodians because of debt.

These baths were more than places for hygiene — they were essential to Roman social life. Citizens would visit the baths after their morning business, using the time not only to clean but to socialize, network, and even conduct business. The grandeur of the baths is exemplified by their mosaics, shrines, and gyms, which catered to all aspects of Roman daily life.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

"We don't care about professional coders anymore," CEO Amjad Masad told Semafor, as the company refocuses on helping non-developers build software using AI. 

The strategic shift follows the September launch of Replit's "Agent" tool, which can create working applications from simple text commands. The tool, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, has driven a five-fold revenue increase in six months. The move marks a significant departure for Replit, which built its business providing online coding tools for software developers. The company is now betting that AI will make traditional programming skills less crucial, allowing non-technical users to create software through natural language instructions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Calls</title><link>https://keygen.sh/blog/no-calls/</link><author>ezekg</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 14:17:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first started Keygen, I had this idea in my head that I could create a
company where I never had to get on a sales call — or any call. Being an
introvert, I absolutely hated calls. They're not only awkward, but a 30 minute
call takes up hours of my headspace. I quickly learned that I didn't want to
do them, and so I decided that I wouldn't.I instituted a bonkers  policy at work.(Even I thought I was being crazy.)However, as Keygen grew, I wanted to start to move more up-market. I wanted
larger customers, because the bigger a customer got, the less support they
typically needed, and of course, the more they paid me. And the bigger
logos help gain trust in a market.The first thing I tried was taking sales calls. I threw up a big 
button on my enterprise pricing page — but I obviously hated it.(What about for non-enterprise leads? Well, I can't justify a call for $49/mo,
I'll tell you that much, especially when they may not buy.)I felt like I was wasting my time, the lead's time, and I could never close a
sale. It felt awkward. I tried for months. I never felt prepared. I felt like
I was constantly talking to the wrong people, slowly climbing the ladder to an
actual stakeholder, repeating myself over and over every call — and then
repeating myself  in a summary email."Couldn't this have all been an email?"(Yes, it could — and should — have been.)"This would be easier if it was async so I could think about my answer.""This person isn't somebody that has the authority to even close.""Is this person even involved in the project?""How do I talk to engineering?""Why am I talking to this person again?"One day, I woke up and out of frustration, I nuked the  button
from my pricing page.When the next person asked for a call, I responded with a simple "No, we don't
do calls, but happy to help via email. Feel free to CC any relevant team
members onto this thread."Their response was surprising. They  what I suggested — they CC'd
the engineering department onto the email, they asked their questions, and we
started chatting integration strategies.Instead of speaking with somebody who was multiple positions removed from the
project, I was speaking with the actual people who could champion Keygen within
the organization — the people who're directly involved — I thought to myself, "did I just bypass all of the red tape?"That month, I closed my first enterprise sale.Nearly everybody I sent that to  to skip the calls too. (I've even had
people literally say that to me in their response!)Sometimes, it didn't work out, and that's okay. I don't expect Keygen to be a
fit for everybody; and not everybody is a fit for Keygen.Am I leaving money on the table?But I personally don't  like I am. I feel like I get to wake up every
morning and do the kind of work that I love to do. And I feel like I have
the freedom to avoid the type of work that I hate to do.I think about it like this: I don't provide white-glove integration or
consulting services, even though I might be able to earn more money if
I did. (And lots of people ask for it!)But that's not what I want to do. That's not why I built Keygen.In the same way, I don't want to do calls.So, in enterprise sales, why do calls happen? Enterprises often default to
calls for these 4 totally-solvable reasons:They don't understand what you offer.They don't know how to use it.They don't know your price.If you want to try , you need to solve these problems.1. They don't understand what you offerThis comes down to messaging. If your messaging is vague, people will need to
get on a call to understand what you actually offer. If your product offering
is too wide (i.e. you do too much), people will feel like
they need to get on a call just to understand if your product is a good fit
for their much more narrow use-case.But if you narrow down your focus, and really nail your messaging — make it
clear what you actually do — you can eliminate the question entirely. Drop the
 taglines and actually sell the product. (And now, it
might be easier to see  some companies use these taglines — it's like
a sales call siren song!)2. They don't know how to use itIf your product isn't self-serve, and if your onboarding sucks, people will
feel like have they to book a call in order to get started.If you don't provide enough information on your website to scope a POC or an
integration, they're going to need to somehow obtain that information. And
that typically requires a call.e.g. if you don't have public documentation, you guessed it — call.(And why would you not have public documentation?)3. They don't know your pricePrice is the big one. Enterprises are used to the dance. You book a call, size
each other up, and then come up with a b.s. price. It's all so tiring. And if
you want to skip calls, you have to dip out of the dance.You can do this by putting enterprise pricing up front and center. I don't care
how large the number is — put it on your pricing page. If you feel like you're
giving up too much money, maybe  isn't for you.When somebody asks for a call to discuss pricing, all you have to do is say
something simple like, "Our enterprise pricing is available here. Let me
know if you have any questions."Last, but most certainly not least, is trust. If an enterprise doesn't trust
you, they will not buy from you —  How do you gain trust? Well, first
off, don't die. Trust is a function of time — i.e. the longer you
exist, the more people will trust that you'll continue to exist.But there are other facets of trust as well, and enterprises will send you huge
time-consuming questionnaires to alleviate all of their concerns. They might
even want to jump on a call. All they're trying to do is be compliant, and you
can help them be compliant without calls.You can do that by clearly articulating how your company handles data, how you
handle security, and how you handle incidents. I'm sure SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI
certifications would help, too, but we don't hold those yet (but our
infrastructure providers do).(At Keygen, we have a security page that outlines all of this, and
essentially answers the questions that are in most security questionnaires
we've seen.)It may be controversial (I'm almost sure of it), but here's my philosophy on
enterprise sales while avoiding sales calls entirely:No sales calls, except for a short  if absolutely needed.
Discovery calls are just a formality.Use email. Ask leads to CC relevant teammates (e.g. engineering).Explain your value clearly. Don't muddy the waters by doing too much. Avoid
vague messaging that prompts more questions.Focus on security, and spell it out in public docs.Document every problem to avoid repeating answers (i.e. allow them to easily
find the answers themselves).Use fixed- or transparent-pricing. (If you like calls, ignore this.)Make onboarding self-serve.I'm sure some people will scoff at some or all of this, but maybe others who are
like myself will read this and realize they don't have to do sales like everybody
else. Enterprise sales don't have to be crazy.If you want to go , maybe try out some of the things above.If you want to do calls, do the opposite of all of these things. some readers have (rightfully) pointed out that we do indeed have
  a  button on our enterprise pricing page, and so there seems to
  be a disconnect. I've been practicing a strict  philosophy for years
  and years and years, and the  button being back is relatively
  new.  I briefly touched on this in the conclusion, but this call is a short 15 min
  ,  a sales call. It's essentially a formality to intro
  each other, make sure we're human, and move onto email for any further
  discussion. There is no further call.  Essentially, over the years of strictly , I discovered that not all
  enterprises will shoot you a cold email to start the conversation, so this
  call is to capture those leads, with the end-goal of having all real
  discussion in email.  The point of  is to dip out of the dance, not of all communication.  tl;dr: some enterprises will bounce if they don't see a  button.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Arc B570 Graphics Performance On Linux</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-arc-b570-linux</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month when Intel formally introduced Battlemage graphics their initial products in the B-Series were the B570 and B580 graphics cards.

like black boxes. You use them every day as a , but you
probably don’t understand them as a , even though
they are nothing but code. Why?They have little in common with programmers’ daily task.Their code bases are so large, so discouraging.But that doesn’t mean you can’t learn these things. People have built
small, toy versions of these things for learning purposes, such as C in 4 Functions, Crafting Interpreters, Web Browser Engineering. It
turns out that if you minimize uninteresting details and focus on the
essentials, you can recreate seemingly complex software and learn its
core ideas.For compilers, some of the core ideas include:Parsing stuff with recursion.Representing a program as a tree and simulate it.Representing a program as a list of instructions with gotos.Stack machine or register machine.None of these ideas are complicated. So a compiler is a viable and
useful exercise for programmers.02. What are the core
ideas of databases?I’ve built a small database in 3000 lines
from scratch in Go to learn the core ideas of databases. It’s not that
complicated if you approach it in a certain way.A database stores data on disk, but why not just use files? Why is
the filesystem not a database? Because databases eliminate a common
source of data corruption: partially written files caused by a crash or
power loss.Video games warn you not to turn off the power while saving, because
a partially written save file can destroy all your progress. Building a
database will teach you how to eliminate this concern. The solution is
an append-only log with a checksum for each item.Append-only means that writes will not destroy existing data.Checksum means that partial writes will be detected and discarded,
making appends power-loss atomic.╔═══╤════╦═══╤════╦══╌╌╌══╦═══╤════╗
║sum│data║sum│data║more...║sum│data║
╚═══╧════╩═══╧════╩══╌╌╌══╩═══╧════╝
                          ╰───┬────╯
                    possible partial writeThese are the first 2 ideas. But they are not enough to build a
database.2.2 Index data with data
structuresLogs have uses for systems like Kafka, but you cannot just put
everything in a log and forget about it. You have to find stuff in it,
so you need data structures like B+trees, LSM-trees, hashtables. That’s
where I started, I built a B+tree in 366 lines.But if you just put a data structure on disk, you have the partial
write problem. Is it possible to apply the log-based ideas to data
structures? There are 2 ideas:The first idea is to make the data structure append-only, like a log.
There are ways to make a B+tree append-only, also called a
. A copy-on-write tree does not
overwrite existing nodes, it creates new nodes from leaf to root for the
entire path. New nodes can be appended like a log.    d           d         D*
   / \         / \       / \
  b   e  ──►  b   e  +  B*  e
 / \         / \       / \
a   c       a   c     a   C*
            original  updatedThe other idea is to use both a log and a main data structure:Before updating the main data structure, store the intended updates
in the log. Each log record contains a list of “write this data to that
position”.Then apply the updates to the main data structure.When the databases start, it can always apply the last log record to
fix possible partial writes in the main data structure, regardless of
its status.I chose the copy-on-write B+tree because it doesn’t require a log,
which reduces the LoC. Moving the B+tree to disk involves interfacing
with the filesystem, including the . In 601 lines, I
have an append-only KV store on disk.2.3 Recycle and reuse unused
spaceI have to handle the consequence of append-only because storage is
not infinite. I simply added a free list to recycle unused B+tree nodes.
In 731 lines, I have a practical KV store.                     first_item
                         ↓
list_head ─► [ next |    xxxxx ]
                ↓
             [ next | xxxxxxxx ]
                ↓
list_tail ─► [ NULL | xxxx     ]
                         ↑
                     last_itemA SQL query can be arbitrarily complex, but it boils down to 2 data
structure operations: point query and range query. That’s why I started
with B+tree data structures. Databases are built on data structures, not
on some theories about relations.I added a layer on top of KV to store records with primary keys and
columns. Each record is encoded as KV pair. The LoC increased to 1107.
But it’s still just a KV. So I added 2 more features:Secondary index, 1438 lines.I didn’t bother with SQL at this point because SQL is just a user
interface. I built APIs for databases which is called a .I can ignore concurrency and make everything serialized. But using a
copy-on-write B+tree means that readers get snapshot isolation for free,
because updates do not destroy old versions. So readers will not be
blocked by the writer.I went a step further to allow write transactions to run
concurrently, and then merge the updates at the end of the transaction.
This requires detecting and rejecting conflicting updates. In 1702
lines, I have a transactional interface.2.6 SQL-like query languageMy user interface is just a set of APIs to operate the database. The
next step is a query language. I chose a SQL-like syntax. I only
implemented simple queries with a single point/range query, so there is
no query planner.Parsing SQL is not a database topic, but a compiler topic. It’s done
by applying recursion in a specific way, which is hardly an idea once
you’ve learned it.A query language is not just about data, it can do computations, like
. So I need an interpreter.Then I need lots of glue code between the query language and the
database. The lines of code increased from 1702 to 2795, most of them
uninteresting.03. Database in 3000
lines, incrementallyThis is my minimalist attempt to build a database from scratch. Each
step adds an essential part while minimizing uninteresting details.Practical KV with a free list.Transactional interfaces.I’ve turned this into a book so that you can
follow my steps. The first half of the book is free online and contains
the most interesting parts of the storage engine, which is usable as a
KV on its own.3000 lines is not much, but it’s an effective exercise. The first
edition took me only 2 months of free time. The book is updated whenever
I learn something new, so this is the second edition.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nepenthes is a tarpit to catch AI web crawlers</title><link>https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/</link><author>blendergeek</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:57:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a tarpit intended to catch web crawlers. Specifically, it's targetting crawlers that scrape data
for LLM's - but really, like the plants it is named after, it'll eat just about anything that finds it's
way inside.It works by generating an endless sequences of pages, each of which with dozens of links, that simply go
back into a the tarpit. Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way, causing them to appear
to be flat files that never change. Intentional delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your
server, in addition to wasting their time. Lastly, optional Markov-babble can be added to the pages, to
give the crawlers something to scrape up and train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse.THIS IS DELIBERATELY MALICIOUS SOFTWARE INTENDED TO CAUSE HARMFUL ACTIVITY.
DO NOT DEPLOY IF YOU AREN'T FULLY COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING.LLM scrapers are relentless and brutual. You may be able to keep them at bay
with this software - but it works by providing them with a neverending stream
of exactly what they are looking for. YOU ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT
CONTINUOUS CPU LOAD, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MARKOV MODULE ENABLED.There is not currently a way to differentiate between web crawlers that
are indexing sites for search purposes, vs crawlers that are training
AI models. ANY SITE THIS SOFTWARE IS APPLIED TO WILL LIKELY DISAPPEAR
FROM ALL SEARCH RESULTS.Expected usage is to hide the tarpit behind nginx or Apache, or whatever else you have implemented your
site in. Directly exposing it to the internet is ill advised. We want it to look as innocent and normal
as possible; in addition HTTP headers are used to configure the tarpit.I'll be using nginx configurations for examples. Here's a real world snippet for the demo above:    location /nepenthes-demo/ {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8893;
            proxy_set_header X-Prefix '/nepenthes-demo';
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_buffering off;
    }
You'll see several headers are added here: "X-Prefix" tells the tarpit that all links should go to that
path. Make this match what is in the 'location' directive. X-Forwarded-For is optional, but will make any
statistics gathered significantly more useful.The proxy_buffering directive is important. LLM crawlers typically disconnect if not given a response within
a few seconds; Nepenthes counters this by drip-feeding a few bytes at a time. Buffering breaks this workaround.You can have multiple proxies to an individual Nepenthes instance; simply set the X-Prefix header accordingly.You can use Docker, or install manually.A Dockerfile and compose.yaml is provided in the /docker directory.
Simply tweak the configuration file to your preferences, 'docker compose up'. You will still need to bootstrap
a Markov corpus if you enable the feature (see next section.)For Manual installation, you'll need to install Lua (5.4 preferred), SQLite (if using Markov), and OpenSSL.
The following Lua modules need to be installed - if they are all present in your package manager, use that;
otherwise you will need to install Luarocks and use it to install the following:Create a nepenthes user (you REALLY don't want this running as root.) Let's assume the user's home
directory is also your install directory.cd scratch/
tar -xvzf nepenthes-1.0.tar.gz
    cp -r nepenthes-1.0/* /home/nepenthes/
Tweak config.yml as you prefer (see below for documentation.) Then you're
ready to start:    su -l -u nepenthes /home/nepenthes/nepenthes /home/nepenthes/config.yml
Sending SIGTERM or SIGINT will shut the process down.Bootstrapping the Markov BabblerThe Markov feature requires a trained corpus to babble from. One was intentionally omitted because, ideally,
everyone's tarpits should look different to evade detection. Find a source of text in whatever language you
prefer; there's lots of research corpuses out there, or possibly pull in some very long Wikipedia articles,
maybe grab some books from Project Gutenberg, the Unix fortune file, it really doesn't matter at all. Be creative!Training is accomplished by sending data to a POST endpoint. This only needs to be done once. Sending training
data more than once cumulatively adds to the existing corpus, allowing you to mix different texts - or train in
chunks.Once you have your body of text, assuming it's called corpus.txt, in your working directory, and you're running
with the default port:curl -XPOST -d ./@corpus.txt -H'Content-type: text/plain' http://localhost:8893/train
This could take a very, VERY long time - possibly hours. curl may potentially time out. See
load.sh in the nepenthes distribution for a script that
incrementally loads training data.The Markov module returns an empt string if there is no corpus. Thus, the tarpit will continue to function
as a tarpit without a corpus loaded. The extra CPU consumed for this check is almost nothing.Want to see what prey you've caught? There are several statistics endpoints, all returning JSON. To see everything:http://{http_host:http_port}/stats
To see user agent strings only:http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/agents
Or IP addresses only:
3
http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/ips/These can get quite big; so it's possible to filter both 'agents' and 'ips', simply add a minimum hit count to the
URL. For example, to see a list of all IPs that have visted more than 100 times:http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/ips/100
Simply curl the URLs, pipe into 'jq' to pretty-print as desired. Script away!Nepenthes used DefensivelyA link to a Nepenthes location from your site will flood out valid URLs
within your site's domain name, making it unlikely the crawler will access
real content.In addition, the aggregated statistics will provide a list of IP addresses
that are almost certainly crawlers and not real users. Use this list to
create ACLs that block those IPs from reaching your content - either return
403, 404, or just block at the firewall level.Integration with fail2ban or blocklistd (or similar) is a future possibility,
allowing realtime reactions to crawlers, but not currently implemented.Using Nepenthes defensively, it would be ideal to turn off the Markov
module, and set both max_delay and min_delay to something large, as a
way to conserve your CPU.Nepenthes used OffensivelyLet's say you've got horsepower and bandwidth to burn, and just want to
see these AI models burn. Nepenthes has what you need:Don't make any attempt to block crawlers with the IP stats. Put the delay
times as low as you are comfortable with. Train a big Markov corpus and
leave the Markov module enabled, set the maximum babble size to something
big. In short, let them suck down as much bullshit as they have diskspace
for and choke on it.All possible directives in config.yaml:http_host : sets the host that Nepenthes will listen on; default is localhost only.http_port : sets the listening port number; default 8893prefix: Prefix all generated links should be given. Can be overriden with the X-Prefix HTTP header. Defaults to nothing.templates: Path to the template files. This should be the '/templates' directory inside your Nepenthes installation.detach: If true, Nepenthes will fork into the background and redirect logging output to Syslog.pidfile: Path to drop a pid file after daemonization. If empty, no pid file is created.max_wait: Longest amount of delay to add to every request. Increase to slow down crawlers; too slow they might not come back.min_wait: The smallest amount of delay to add to every request. A random value is chosen between max_wait and min_wait.real_ip_header: Changes the name of the X-Forwarded-For header that communicates the actual client IP address for statistics gathering.prefix_header: Changes the name of the X-Prefix header that overrides the prefix configuration variable.forget_time: length of time, in seconds, that a given user-agent can go missing before being deleted from the statistics table.forget_hits: A user-agent that generates more than this number of requests will not be deleted from the statistics table.persist_stats: A path to write a JSON file to, that allows statistics to survive across crashes/restarts, etcseed_file: Specifies location of persistent unique instance identifier. This allows two instances with the same corpus to have different looking tarpits.words: path to a dictionary file, usually '/usr/share/dict/words', but could vary depending on your OS.markov: Path to a SQLite database containing a Markov corpus. If not specified, the Markov feature is disabled.markov_min: Minimum number of words to babble on a page.markov_max: Maximum number of words to babble on a page. Very large values can cause serious CPU load.Version numbers use a simple process: If the only changes are fully backwards
compatible, the minor number changes. If the user/administrator needs to change
anything after or part of the upgrade, the major number changes and the minor
number resets to zero.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMDGPU VirtIO Native Context Merged: Native AMD Driver Support Within Guest VMs</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMDGPU-VirtIO-Native-Mesa-25.0</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:43:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An exciting change was just merged into Mesa 25.0 that has been about two years in the making...

On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I made an open source directory of where to showoff your projects</title><link>https://github.com/KingMenes/awesome-launch</link><author>soGeneri</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:23:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I made an open source directory for sharing projectsEver wondered how to show off that something you just built?

DESCRIPTION
How can businesses thrive by embracing optionality through digital transformation?
Authors Matt McLarty and Stephen Fishman talk about their book “Unbundling the Enterprise” with Erik Wilde. They highlight the power of APIs and flexible systems in enabling companies to capitalize on unforeseen opportunities, or "happy accidents," and how low-cost experimentation can drive long-term success.

The conversation emphasizes that optionality is crucial not only in tech but also in business strategy, urging organizations to view their digital capabilities as part of a broader platform that supports both developer empowerment and revenue growth. With insights on optimization, platform engineering, and the importance of aligning technology with business objectives, the authors offer a roadmap for companies to navigate the future with agility and resilience.

It's bad for my health, so why do I keep doing it?  Because once in a while, I'll find a post so good that it teaches me something I never knew before, and all the scrolling feels worth it.
But I've stumbled upon an old piece of free and open source tech, relatively unknown today, which is THE solution of solving the problems with modern media without sacrificing accessible, good content: RSS. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter — platforms built for engagement, not efficiency. Instead of showing you high-quality posts upfront, they pad your feed with memes, spam, and astroturfing. There is only so much 'good' content created in a day. By padding your feed with trash, they make the limited amount of good posts "last longer". 
These sites want you to spend more time scrolling on their website, so they feed you scraps which makes the occasional great post feels like a jackpot.
This concept, operant conditioning, was developed by B.F. Skinner — Yes, the mind behind the Skinnerbox.While some sites offer filtering or sorting options, manually settings these options every time you want to access a subreddit is just not doable.  You could, of course, stop consuming content from these websites. However, this would mean potentially missing really good content; content you'd learn from, interesting ideas, and more.
But it doesn't have to be this way. You can reclaim your attention span while still having access to the same quality content as before.  RSS is like your youtube subscription feed in hyperdrive. Subscribe to sites you love and decide what shows up — no exploitative social media algorithm needed. No more ads or algorithms deciding how to keep you doomscrolling. This 1999 tech actually solves a lot of 2025 problems.
Here's the kicker: Most websites, even social media, quietly support RSS feeds.You can filter out keywords, set minimum upvotes or like counts, and much more! Modern RSS clients allow you to make filters using Regex, and there are a  of software and services you can use to tune up your filtering to 11.TL;DR: Never see noise, and never miss hidden gems again!But how do you get started with RSS? It's easier than you think!I personally self-host an open source RSS reader: Tiny Tiny RSS
If you don't want to host it yourself, you can google for companies offering easy and accessible RSS readers.To make it easier, let's differentiate between three levels of ease when it comes to adding a website to RSS: Easy, medium, and hard.
I'll be going over how to add several popular sites to your feed.Want a youtube channel in your RSS feed? Just copy the channel's URL and subscribe to it in your reader. Done.If you like games, you might want to subscribe to IGN. There's no clear RSS button, so the best course of action would be to google "IGN RSS".This leads to a nice IGN RSS Feeds page with multiple categorized feeds for you to pick from. If you wanted to subscribe to "Game Articles", you'd right-click on the game articles link, press "copy link", go to your RSS reader of choice and subscribe to the link you copied.  Now all IGN Game Articles will show up in your RSS feed as they are published!Some websites don't have a dedicated RSS button, but still support RSS. You can discover their RSS urls by adding .rss, atom.xml, feed, etc. at the end of the site's URL, for example https://website.com/atom.xml. Almost all RSS readers support Atom feeds. For more examples, check this Reddit comment.Some sites like HackerNews have RSS support. However, this RSS can be extremely limited if you want to filter posts so your feed isn't spammed by low effort content. Some people are nice enough to set up a "middleman" between your RSS feed and the website, so you can pull the RSS feed through the middleman while doing actions like filtering it.For example, if you wanted to subscribe to HackerNews but filter out low upvote count posts, you could subscribe to HNRSS instead of through HN directly. For example, I filter out posts below 150 upvotes by to this url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=150
Sometimes these services open-source their code so you can self-host the 'middleman'.When removing the optional search term from a reddit search URL, don't forget to remove the 
When removing the sort options
If adding more search terms, add a + between them!I love managing my homelab. I follow /r/homelab. Some posts are really good and teach me a lot.
However, there's a lot of noise posted to that subreddit; I do not want to see memes, and pictures of people's hardware setup gets boring quick. I'm interested in hidden gems, threads where a lot of interesting info is explained, things I can really learn a lot from.Step 1: Filter out picture posts.Reddit hack: Filter out picture posts by searching for 'self:true' in a subreddit. Bonus: You can subscribe to that specific search query as a RSS feed for text posts only.So instead of subscribing to a subreddit's RSS directly, you do a search for posts in that subreddit and then subscribe to  RSS feed.
The RSS link you should subscribe to should look someting like this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on
You can change 'homelab' to your subreddit of choice.The  parameter in the URL (probably) means "Restrict_subreddit". Removing this from the search will yield results from different subreddits than the one you're searching in. If you think that parameter is redundant, I agree.There are a  of text-only submissions on /r/homelab. Gems are relatively sparce. Lots of low quality content. It's not the subreddit's fault; this is standard across Reddit.Step 2: Filter for qualitySeems easy; let's add a 'minimal upvotes' query to the search, right?
Sadly, Reddit doesn't support that.. a shame, really.
However, a workaround is sorting by 'Top' and asking the search to show us the 'top posts of this week'. Note: 'This week' would mean 'past 7 days' instead of 'posted this week'.Filtering by 'Top of ...' always returns 25 items. This means that if you sort by 'top of this week', on average of 25/7=3,57 NEW posts get added to your feed each day! This is a great way to only see the highest scoring posts of each day.Adding this sort on top of the RSS feed from step 1 results in an URL like this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=yearIf you don't care about only seeing text posts, removing  does  work for RSS feeds, even though it does work for direct searches. Instead, subscribe to the subreddit's "top" RSS and filter by time. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top.rss?t=monthFor reference, here is how many posts you would get in your RSS feed, depening on your reddit sorting:And just like that, we converted a high-noise subreddit to an RSS feed which only gives us the best the subreddit has to offer.If you wanted to subscribe to all new posts in a subreddit, you would subscribe to an url like https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT_NAME/new/.rss?sort=new. For a more extensive Reddit RSS guide, see this postSome sites might not have support for an RSS feed. Sometimes you can get away with a neat google trick:Most of the time you'd need something to generate the RSS for you. You could use one of many RSS feed generators available online, or host one yourself. Most of these feed generators have enhanced filtering tools as well.I haven't had to do this yet, however I've heard really good things about the open source RSS-BridgeHow you'd set up a feed generator depends on the software, so I won't expand upon that here.Separating yourself from the algorithmic whims of social media platform is easier than ever. With RSS, you can stay informed, save time, and never miss the content that truly matters.To end this post, here is a list of (RSS supported) sites I think are really interesting.

It wasn’t a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don’t need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I’ll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier—and hopefully, they’ll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here’s what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.This post is for paid subscribers.

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.And then this slowly started to flourish.One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.With unfathomable levels of gratitude,(P.S. If you are chasing something you think you want or need, or are doubting whether you are enough, take a minute and give this a listen. It had a big impact on me at a pivotal time.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Did the Fire Hydrants Run Dry in the Pacific Palisades?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E7qrP9CdRk</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 21:17:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When fire hydrants ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire, it sparked a wave of anger and even misinformation.

It is a popular tool for sending or receiving files, making backups, or setting up mirrors. It minimizes data copied by transferring only the changed parts of files, making it faster and more bandwidth-efficient than traditional copying methods provided by tools like sftp or ftp-ssl. Rsync versions 3.3.0 and below has been found with SIX serious vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these to leak your data, corrupt your files, or even take over your system. There is a heap-based buffer overflow with a CVSS score of 9.8 that needs to be addressed on both the client and server sides of rsync package.

Are we all living in The Matrix? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with actor Laurence Fishburne to explore the science of The Matrix, simulation theory, and who has the better deep voice. Would you take the red pill? 

Would you rather have truth or normalcy? We explore the choice Morpheus presents Neo and how it pertains to science. Laurence shares the experience of bringing Morpheus to life. He and Neil unpack the film’s profound symbolism as well as discuss the blending of ancient mythology with the emerging digital age.

We analyze the plausibility of the movie’s central premise. Can humans really serve as batteries for machines? We explore simulation theory, pondering whether our universe could be one of many nested simulations, as posed by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom. From the optical science behind the iconic spoon-bending scene to the film’s intricate religion and philosophy, we explore the storytelling elements that make The Matrix timeless.

Neil connects its themes to questions about reality, truth, and human potential. Plus, a few surprises—including the “deep voice-off” and musings on why gods always have baritone voices—make this episode a must-listen for movie buffs and science enthusiasts alike.

But this knowledge is in danger of disappearing. Leticia Yawanawa has an ambitious plan: she wants to preserve herbal medicine for posterity.

The deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest is having a devastating impact on the global climate. But it is also displacing indigenous tribes and eradicating their unique knowledge of the healing powers of nature. 
Scientists agree that only a third of the total biodiversity of the rainforest has been researched. Much of the knowledge is in the heads of indigenous scholars. This understanding is passed on orally, from generation to generation. Many tribes are being driven out of their habitats. The knowledge of the shamans - who in addition to their spiritual duties treat their people medicinally using plants and herbs from the jungle - is in danger of being lost forever. 
In the documentary, Leticia brings together shamans from different tribes and asks them to share their knowledge. They set off on journeys through the rainforest, often lasting days. Here, they share their knowledge of medicinal plants, along with traditional rites and ceremonies. We learn about the healing powers of plants and herbs. Some may be familiar to us, while others are known only to local indigenous populations.

A few months back, I launched a product on one of the big platforms, and... nothing. It got buried under dozens of other launches within hours. All that work, all that excitement is gone in the blink of an eye. No one even saw it.It stung. I wasn’t mad, well, maybe a little but mostly, I just felt invisible. The truth is, indie makers like me don’t have big teams or budgets to fight for visibility. We rely on genuine support and connections. I couldn’t stop thinking about how many great ideas never get the attention they deserve because they’re overshadowed.• 10 launches per day, max. Limiting the number of daily launches ensures that every product gets its moment in the spotlight.• 2 votes per user, per day. This isn’t a popularity contest. You only get two votes, so people have to really think about which products they want to support. It’s quality over quantity.• “Under Radar” feature. This one’s my favorite. If a product doesn’t get much love on its launch day, it gets a second chance to shine the next day. Because timing shouldn’t be the only thing standing between you and success.There’s more like badges, comments, streaks but the heart of it is simple: a fair shot for indie makers.I built this because I believe every product deserves to be seen, especially the ones built by solo makers and small teams putting their heart into something they truly care about. And I didn’t build this to compete with Product Hunt. I built it to give indie makers the platform they deserve, one where their creativity truly gets noticed.If this sounds like something you’d want to check out, I’d love your thoughts. I’m still tweaking and improving it every day based on feedback.Let me know what you think and if you’ve got a product you’re proud of, I’d love to see it shine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Top Games of 2024: Part 1 with Jonathan Ferguson and Dave Jewitt</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UMUsMA-eX4</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 16:03:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week and next, Jonathan & Dave look back and reflect on 2024's videogames and how they handle firearms and decide which 5 they loved the most.

‘Possible worlds’ are all the ways in which a world can be. A ‘world’ is a complete state of cosmic affairs: all the infinite variations of innumerable parts and their myriad relationships. Possible world’s have become an indispensable philosophical technique for exploring modalities—issues of possibility and necessity that are essential for examining God.

ABSTRACT
How can you work effectively with AI as your colleague?

Since March 2023 (the release of GPT4) I've worked almost fulltime with AI-powered software development. Both as a productivity tool, to get work done faster and better, and also as way of building new types of products and features that were previously impossible. In fact, GenAI has completely changed the way I work and the way I look at software development. It feels like I've gained superpowers, but I've had to unlearn and change habits that I've built up over 30 years.

Coding with AI is a very different way of working. And like any other skill, you kind of suck at it at first but improve with practice. The transition to this strange new world can be jarring, but it is unavoidable. Being a developer in 2024 and not coding with AI is the equivalent of being 2022 and manually writing machine code or manually creating punched cards.

In this talk I'll share practical experiences from AI-powered software development - tips, tricks, and pitfalls - using mostly live demos. These techniques will reduce your time from Idea to Working Code, which is a nice feeling 🙂 [...]

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections. Hence, knowing SSH client control commands can save you time and boost your productivity when such gotchas occur. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parallels Can Now Run x86 Windows and Linux On Apple Silicon Mac</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/15/0216248/parallels-can-now-run-x86-windows-and-linux-on-apple-silicon-mac?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop now supports running 64-bit x86 operating systems on Apple Silicon Macs through its proprietary emulation engine, enabling users to run traditional Windows and Linux distributions. However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cloud Native Live: Building open core SaaS services in 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1CbFW49OKY</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 06:17:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

I'm in a mood tonight, so this will be less of a well-considered essay and more of a rant, partially in the vein of . Don't take anything here  seriously.Why does nobody care about anything? The world is full of stuff that could be excellent with just 1% more effort. But people don't care.Have you been to the DMV? It sucked? There is a human being whose job it is to be in charge of the DMV. They do not care that it sucks.Ever used a piece of software that's buggy as hell, looks bad, but still costs money, presumably because the company behind it has found some regulatory capture to justify their existence? The programmer who wrote it probably doesn't care. Their manager definitely doesn't care. The regulators don't care.I've met a few people that work for municipal governments. Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.Here's a dumb example. This bike lane ends at the bottom of a hill near me. It merges onto the sidewalk at a crazy sharp angle. Cyclists are coming down this hill at 20mph or so. Tons of people can't make this angle at that speed and hit the vertical curb face, damaging their bike and injuring themselves. If they're unlucky, they go flying into the signpost.Why does this ramp suck so much? For literally the exact same effort it took to build, it could have been built 10x better. Make the angle 20 degrees instead of 70. Put the ramp just after the sign instead of just before it. Make the far curb face sloped instead of vertical. Put some visual indication the lane ends 50 feet uphill. Why wasn't this done?Because the engineer who designed it and the managers at the department of transportation do not give a shit.This isn't even a pro- or anti-bikes thing. The ramp was getting built by whatever mandate. You're the engineer. Do you make it bad, or do you spend 1% more time thinking about it and make it good for literally the same cost? You make it bad, because you do not care.I actually pointed this ramp out to the director of the Seattle Department of Transportation during a walking tour. He made a note of it over a year ago that I assume was promptly forgotten about. He does not care.These new lights objectively suck to anyone not driving. If your house is near one, they suck. If you're walking your dog at night (which starts at 5PM for much of the year in Seattle), they  suck.But whoever made the decision to switch the lights does not care. It's entirely possible they don't even live in the city, but instead live in a pleasant exurb. Or maybe they don't walk at night and have never considered that other people do.White LEDs reduce car crashes by 0.1% and that is measurable, but sleep quality and aesthetics are not measurable. You just have to care about them. And nobody cares.But that's enough city stuff. Plenty of people don't care about plenty of other things.You put on your turn signal in traffic to merge. The person who could let you in is looking straight ahead, zoned out. Why would they look around to see if they could cooperate with anyone? They're already in the lane they need to be in. They. Do. Not. Care.You're at the airport. There's a group in front of you on the escalator taking up the full width, preventing anyone from walking by. They do not care.You're on the sidewalk and someone has headphones in, walking in the center of the path. A mom and stroller are behind them. They can't hear her "excuse me" to get their attention. They have not even considered the possibility that anyone in the world exists but them. They do not care.The McDonald's touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.At work the junior engineer sends you some code to review. The code was clearly written in a first draft, and then just iteratively patched until the tests passed, then immediately sent to you to review without any further improvement. They do not care.The guy on the hiking trail is playing his shitty EDM on his bluetooth speaker, ruining nature for everyone else. He does not care.The doctor misdiagnoses your illness whose symptoms are in the first paragraph of the trivially googleable wikipedia article. He does not care.People don't pick up after their dogs. The guy at the gym doesn't re-rack the weights. The lady at the grocery store leaves the cart in the middle of the parking lot. They. Do. Not. Care.I could continue in this vein for another few pages, but it would be boring and you get the point. We are surrounded by antisocial bastards.Some of them like the people who don't pick up after their dogs are legitimately just assholes.Others, like the bureaucrats in the city who mess up our lives in more indirect ways are more victims of The System. But they are still guilty of lacking the personal agency to fight it or leave in protest, and I still — potentially unjustly — condemn them.We have examples like Elon who, through sheer force of will, defeats armies of people who don't care. For his many faults, you can't say the man doesn't care.When I  my former Big Tech job, everyone cared. Over time, incentives attracted a different set of people who didn't care as much. Eventually those people became the majority. It's painful to work with people who don't care if you care a lot, and eventually I left because of it.Now, I'm at a small startup full of people who care. Customer bug reports go right to our chatroom. We fix them immediately. I feel guilty I wrote the bugs at all. We reach out to users to see if we can make their lives better. We care.I want to live in a community where everyone cares.The one place in the world you get this vibe is probably Japan. Most people just . Patrick McKenzie refers to this as the will to have nice things. Japan has it, and the US mostly does not.In Japan, you get the impression that everyone takes their job and role in society seriously. The median Japanese 7-11 clerk takes their job more seriously than the median US city bureaucrat. And the result is obvious if you visit both places.Is it possible for us to care in the US? To foster the will to have nice things? I think we actually had this in the aftermath of WW2. The country was mostly on the same page about progress, values, the future. But over a few generations, more and more people defect. Living among defectors is demoralizing and causes more defections (much like my own departure from my Big Tech job!). Eventually society is full of defectors.But I don't think this is a full explanation. Most people aren't , they merely won't go  to add to the world. And I can feel myself getting pulled in that direction.I used to go a lot more out of my way to add to the world. A few years ago, I installed a bunch of dog bag dispensers on the telephone poles of my neighborhood. I still keep them stocked.I was, somewhat naively, hoping that somehow I could get a snowball of care going. I built curb ramps on legacy curbs that lacked them. I lobbied the city to open new park space. Improve crosswalks. And much more!But the snowball never started. Nobody cares. Rather, there is a tiny minority of activists who care. They spend all their free time doing activist stuff — basically fighting the city to try to make the bureaucrats care about little bits here and there.But I've come to accept that I just don't have the disposition to fight all the time. I'm not a fighter. I care  and I just want to live in a place where other people care.We're not going to move to Japan, but would absolutely be willing to move within the US.Does such a community really exist? Where  cares? Or at least a supermajority? Or does it need to be built?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: LLMpeg</title><link>https://github.com/jjcm/llmpeg</link><author>jjcm</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 02:29:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Inspired by the "ffmpeg by examples" comments, here's a simple script that pulls it all together.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

These screens occupy the dimensions of your terminal by default. While you can have many different screens in a single application, only one screen may be active at a time.When you create your  class, Textual will create a screen object implicitly. Yes, Textual requires you to have at least one screen or your application won’t work. If you do not create a new screen or switch to a different one, the default screen is where your widgets will get mounted or composed to.Screens are a great way to organize your application. Many applications have settings pages, help pages, and more. These are just a few examples of how you can use screens.Now that you know what a screen is, you’re ready to learn how to create new ones!When you create an application, you create a  implicitly. But how do you create your own ? Fortunately, Textual has made that easy. All you need to do is import the  class from  and extend it as needed.You can style screens the same way you do other widgets, except for the dimensions as screens are always the same size as your terminal window.To see how this all works, you will create an application with two screens:You second screen, which will be greenYou will be able to switch between the screens using a button. Each screen has its own button and its own event or message handler.Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called  with the following contents:# two_screens.py

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button

class GreenScreen(Screen):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Button("Main Screen", id="main")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#main")
    def on_main(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()


class MainAop(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("Switch", id="switch")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#switch")
    def on_switch(self) -> None:
        self.push_screen(GreenScreen())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()You use Textual’s handy  decorator to match against the button’s . That keeps the message from bubbling around to other event handlers, which is what could happen if you had used , for example.When you run your application, you will see something like this:Try clicking the buttons and switching between the screens.Of course, you don’t need to use button’s at all, if you don’t want to. You could use keyboard shortcuts instead. Why not give that a try?Go back to your Python IDE and create a new file called  with this code in it:# two_screens_keys_only.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Label


class GreenScreen(Screen):
    BINDINGS = [("escape", "app.pop_screen", "Dismiss the screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Label("Second Screen")


class MainAop(App):
    SCREENS = {"green": GreenScreen}
    BINDINGS = [("n", "push_screen('green')", "Green Screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Label("Main screen")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()Using keyboard shortcuts makes your code a little less verbose. However, since you aren’t using a  widget, the shortcuts are not shown on-screen to the user. When you are on the main screen, you must press the letter “n” on your keyboard to switch to the . Then when you want to switch back, you press “Esc” or escape.Here’s what the screen looks like on the :Now try using the keys mentioned to swap between the two screens. Feel free to change the keyboard bindings to keys of your own choosing.Textual can do much more with Screens than what is covered in this brief tutorial. However, you can use this information as a great starting point for learning how to add one more additional screens to your GUI in your terminal.Play around with these examples and then run over to the Textual documentation to learn about some of the other widgets you can add to bring your application to life.If you’d like to learn more about Textual, check out my book: Creating TUI Applications with Textual and Python, which you can find on the following websites:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sandbox Review January 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU94g9tn2WQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 20:34:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: WASM-powered codespaces for Python notebooks on GitHub</title><link>https://docs.marimo.io/guides/publishing/playground/#open-notebooks-hosted-on-github</link><author>mscolnick</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:46:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Our online playground lets you

It’s a pathway to parenthood with children who aren’t biologically their own. While egg donation is legal in many countries, it’s banned in places like Switzerland and Germany.

When Sandra Cesna from Switzerland held the first positive pregnancy test in her hands, it was like a dream come true. With medical assistance, she and her husband will be able to have children. The egg came from a donor in Finland.

Since egg donation is prohibited in Switzerland and Germany, many women travel abroad to countries like Spain or Czechia, where donors are readily available. However, in these countries, donations are strictly anonymous, meaning the child will never know their genetic mother. In contrast, Finland offers a more open approach: Sandra Cesna’s child will have the option to contact the donor upon turning 18, if they wish to.

This film takes a compassionate look at the impact of this medical dilemma and the laws that often make little sense to the people who are affected by them. Why is sperm donation allowed in so many places, but not egg donation? Why do donors in so many places have to remain anonymous, even though it could cause emotional problems for the children? The film also shows that with an empathetic approach, it’s possible to avoid trauma and help children and families navigate this complicated journey.

This film asks the question, How do Native Hawaiians in the diaspora keep the feeling of Aloha in their hearts, even when they live thousands of miles away? Dear Aloha follows two Native Hawaiians living in the Pacific Northwest as they reflect on how “Aloha” sustains them amidst distance, loss, and longing. Meanwhile, back in Hawai’i, local residents grapple with the legacy of colonization that has resulted in many Hawaiians being displaced from their homeland.

'HOMEGROWN: A Part Of/Apart From' is a collection of short films from the U.S. territories and Hawaiʻi exploring issues of cultural identity, sovereignty, and agency, as residents and members of the diaspora grapple with what it means to be “a part of and apart from” the mainland U.S.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness— leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

The clean energy will be used to power AI servers and the electricity it generates will be sold to one company: Microsoft. Reviving nuclear power plants has drawn support from Silicon Valley executives like Elon Musk, but what does it take to actually restart one of these plants?

WSJ went inside the nuclear plant to learn the steps it takes to restart the clean energy source and examined the regulations in place in order to restart these reactors.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How To Lead Through Transformation in Tech • Hannah Foxwell &amp; Charles Humble • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La-oAqRr6cM</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOunscripted

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding. Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.💡  Record yourself solving a problem.Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.Interviewers don’t expect perfection—they expect clarity and problem-solving skills.6. And Finally, You Need to Build ResilienceLet’s talk about failure.It’s not if—it’s when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.But every “wrong answer” was a chance to learn something new.💡  Keep a failure journal.Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you’ll tackle similar issues in the future.Failure isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of better solutions.Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:Section for training as a team.Educational section to learn new topics.Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.Slightly advanced topics.The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.If you’ve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life—more on that in this post:Competitive Programming Changed My Life ForeverI’m writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden—a place where I’ve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life…22 days ago · 31 likes · 7 comments · Alberto GonzalezYour dream job isn’t just about a bigger paycheck. It’s about proving to yourself that you belong.Let’s turn those hidden fears into unstoppable momentum.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linus Torvalds Offers to Build Guitar Effects Pedal For Kernel Developer</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/2131230/linus-torvalds-offers-to-build-guitar-effects-pedal-for-kernel-developer?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Linux creator Linus Torvalds announced a playful giveaway for kernel contributors: he'll hand-build a guitar effects pedal for one lucky developer selected at random, using his holiday hobby skills with pedal kits. To qualify, developers must have a 2024 commit in Torvalds' kernel git tree and email him with the subject "I WANT A GUITAR PEDAL". He'll pick a winner at random, use his own money to buy a pedal kit from a company called Aion FX, and then 'build it with my own shaky little fingers, and send it to the victim by US postal services.'" The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."
 
"I will test the result to the best of my abilities, and the end result may actually work ... but you should set your expectations along the lines of "quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How William the Conqueror Rewrote History | Lucy Worsley Investigates</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k769WvKFP0</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/4gY7q1J | #LucyWorsleyPBS

Air raid sirens have long become part of everyday life in the Ukrainian city. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion into Ukraine in February 2022, residents took shelter underground. Early on in the crisis, subway stations were converted to schools and theaters relocated underground. Today, there are even plans to construct a subterranean recreational park. What does everyday life look like in a war-torn city? Carolina Chimoy visited Kharkiv to find out.

This after a brief period when things were blissfully quiet. Matt Mullenweg stopped commenting for a while, though his company had launched WP Engine Tracker — a site for tracking WordPress-driven websites that moved away from WP Engine. I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic — because of a sweetheart deal.On December 20th, Mullenweg announced that WordPress.org would be on holiday break for an unspecified amount of time. In a post on the WordPress.org blog, he again mentioned being “compelled to provide free labor and services to WP Engine thanks to the success of their expensive lawyers”. He also invited people to fund legal attacks against him by signing up for WP Engine services, and hoped to have the “time, energy, and money to reopen all of this sometime in the new year”.This was the first time WordPress.org had ever gone on break, and it was another instance of Mullenweg using a core part of the WordPress community to send a message. WordPress.org returned to service on January 4th, but plugin and theme updates weren’t being reviewed until then. I’m all for giving volunteers time off, but this came as a surprise to the community and there was initially no indication when the break would end. Mullenweg’s “woe is me” language around maybe, possibly, being able to find the resources to reopen a core piece of WordPress infrastructure didn’t help things. It further cemented that Matt Mullenweg’s current mood is an important function of whether or not the WordPress community operates smoothly.While WordPress.org was on hiatus, Mullenweg also reached out to the WPDrama community on Reddit, asking what drama he should create in 2025. A couple of years ago, this sort of thing would have been some tongue-in-cheek fun from a person who’s always been a bit of a goof. These days it comes off a bit differently.Automattic noted it would focus its open source hours on “security and critical updates”. The other hours would be redirected to for-profit projects like WordPress.com. This means that the community will be expected to take up the slack if it wants WordPress to improve. I worry that 45 hours a week isn’t enough time to keep WordPress secure and bug-free. Hopefully others will step up, here.But you know what? In a normal world, having the community taking the lead would be fine. I’d be all for it! The problem is that Mullenweg has final say over some very important parts of the WordPress community. He also seems recently to be acting more childishly and impulsively than usual.Another thing that came to light yesterday was that the WordPress Sustainability committee was shuttered after a core member, Thijs Buijs, stepped down. In a post on the WordPress Slack, Buijs cited the “2025 drama” post on Reddit as the reason he was leaving, and called for a change in WordPress community leadership. In response, Mullenweg responded in part with “[t]oday I learned that we have a sustainability team”, and closed the channel.The WordPress Sustainability Team had four core members, and 11 people who had contributed on GitHub. As far as I can tell, they were all community members, and none were Automattic employees. Even if it wasn’t producing amazing results, I can’t see what harm it was doing. The sin was pointing out something stupid that Mullenweg did, and having a member wanting change. The optics, especially given current world events, are definitely not great. The wildest part of this to me is that there’s video of Mullenweg — live on stage at Word Camp Europe in 2022 — requesting the creation of the Slack channel he was turning off. Guess that slipped his mind.All of this bodes poorly for the open source version of WordPress. I think it’s perfectly fair for Automattic to switch gears and focus on for-profit projects — it’s a company after all. The problem is that there’s a void being left. Automattic had, for better or worse, lead the development of both the commercial and open source pieces of the WordPress ecosystem. Now it seems like the community needs to take over, but Mullenweg still holds all the keys.In the announcement, Automattic said that WordPress.com would be updated to be more in line with the open source version of WordPress. This also makes sense to me, as WordPress.com has always been a weird version of the software. Of course, having slight differences to the core WordPress experience is the argument that Mullenweg initially used to call WP Engine a “cancer”, but who’s keeping track? I’d also like to point out again that Automattic invested in WP Engine in 2011. It also acquired Pressable in 2016, likely because it was a hosting service that offered a “real” version of WordPress, unlike WordPress.com.It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet would be for people to rally around new community-driven infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though, and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of WordPress relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls. Joost de Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular SEO plugin, wrote a blog post with some thoughts on the matter. I’m hoping that more prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way forward can be found.: Moments after posting this, I was pointed to a story on TechCrunch about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he previously promoted (though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress. Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU Probes Apple&apos;s New App Store Fees</title><link>https://apple.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/1830218/eu-probes-apples-new-app-store-fees?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:49:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[European Union regulators are investigating Apple's revised app store fees amid concerns they may increase costs for developers, according to Bloomberg News.

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US splits world into three tiers for AI chip access</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the US government announced a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those manufactured by Nvidia, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nancey Murphy - Cosmology and Creation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_5AWZPQTQ</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Listen to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.

the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:

  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.

This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who demonstrates
his purity by attacking anyone who breaks the rules. Every
society has these people. All that changes is the rules they
enforce. In Victorian England it was Christian virtue. In
Stalin's Russia it was orthodox Marxism-Leninism. For the
woke, it's social justice.So if you want to understand wokeness, the question to ask
is not why people behave this way. Every society has prigs.
The question to ask is why our prigs are priggish about
these ideas, at this moment. And to answer that we have to
ask when and where wokeness began.The answer to the first question is the 1980s. Wokeness is a
second, more aggressive wave of political correctness, which
started in the late 1980s, died down in the late 1990s, and
then returned with a vengeance in the early 2010s, finally
peaking after the riots of 2020.This was not the original meaning of woke, but it's rarely
used in the original sense now. Now the pejorative sense is
the dominant one. What  it mean now? I've often been
asked to define both wokeness and political correctness by
people who think they're meaningless labels, so I will. They
both have the same definition:

  An aggressively performative focus on social justice.

In other words, it's people being prigs about social
justice. And that's the real problem — the
performativeness, not the social justice.Racism, for example, is a genuine problem. Not a problem on
the scale that the woke believe it to be, but a genuine one.
I don't think any reasonable person would deny that. The
problem with political correctness was not that it focused
on marginalized groups, but the shallow, aggressive way in
which it did so. Instead of going out into the world and
quietly helping members of marginalized groups, the
politically correct focused on getting people in trouble for
using the wrong words to talk about them.As for where political correctness began, if you think about
it, you probably already know the answer. Did it begin
outside universities and spread to them from this external
source? Obviously not; it has always been most extreme in
universities. So where in universities did it begin? Did it
begin in math, or the hard sciences, or engineering, and
spread from there to the humanities and social sciences?
Those are amusing images, but no, obviously it began in the
humanities and social sciences.Why there? And why then? What happened in the humanities and
social sciences in the 1980s?A successful theory of the origin of political correctness
has to be able to explain why it didn't happen earlier. Why
didn't it happen during the protest movements of the 1960s,
for example? They were concerned with much the same issues.
The reason the student protests of the 1960s didn't lead to
political correctness was precisely that — they were
student movements. They didn't have any real power. The
students may have been talking a lot about women's
liberation and black power, but it was not what they were
being taught in their classes. Not yet.But in the early 1970s the student protestors of the 1960s
began to finish their dissertations and get hired as
professors. At first they were neither powerful nor
numerous. But as more of their peers joined them and the
previous generation of professors started to retire, they
gradually became both.The reason political correctness began in the humanities and
social sciences was that these fields offered more scope for
the injection of politics. A 1960s radical who got a job as
a physics professor could still attend protests, but his
political beliefs wouldn't affect his work. Whereas research
in sociology and modern literature can be made as political
as you like.
I saw political correctness arise. When I started college in
1982 it was not yet a thing. Female students might object if
someone said something they considered sexist, but no one
was getting  for it. It was still not a thing when
I started grad school in 1986. It was definitely a thing in
1988 though, and by the early 1990s it seemed to pervade
campus life.What happened? How did protest become punishment? Why were
the late 1980s the point at which protests against male
chauvinism (as it used to be called) morphed into formal
complaints to university authorities about sexism?
Basically, the 1960s radicals got tenure. They became the
Establishment they'd protested against two decades before.
Now they were in a position not just to speak out about
their ideas, but to enforce them.A new set of moral rules to enforce was exciting news to a
certain kind of student. What made it particularly exciting
was that they were allowed to attack professors. I remember
noticing that aspect of political correctness at the time.
It wasn't simply a grass-roots student movement. It was
faculty members encouraging students to attack other faculty
members. In that respect it was like the Cultural
Revolution. That wasn't a grass-roots movement either; that
was Mao unleashing the younger generation on his political
opponents. And in fact when Roderick MacFarquhar started
teaching a class on the Cultural Revolution at Harvard in
the late 1980s, many saw it as a comment on current events.
I don't know if it actually was, but people thought it was,
and that means the similarities were obvious.
College students larp. It's their nature. It's usually
harmless. But larping morality turned out to be a poisonous
combination. The result was a kind of moral etiquette,
superficial but very complicated. Imagine having to explain
to a well-meaning visitor from another planet why using the
phrase "people of color" is considered particularly
enlightened, but saying "colored people" gets you fired. And
why exactly one isn't supposed to use the word "negro" now,
even though Martin Luther King used it constantly in his
speeches. There are no underlying principles. You'd just
have to give him a long list of rules to memorize.

The danger of these rules was not just that they created
land mines for the unwary, but that their elaborateness made
them an effective substitute for virtue. Whenever a society
has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a
substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the
world, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than
everyone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to
bad people.But for it to work as a substitute for virtue, orthodoxy
must be difficult. If all you have to do to be orthodox is
wear some garment or avoid saying some word, everyone knows
to do it, and the only way to seem more virtuous than other
people is to actually be virtuous. The shallow, complicated,
and frequently changing rules of political correctness made
it the perfect substitute for actual virtue. And the result
was a world in which good people who weren't up to date on
current moral fashions were brought down by people whose
characters would make you recoil in horror if you could see
them.One big contributing factor in the rise of political
correctness was the lack of other things to be morally pure
about. Previous generations of prigs had been prigs mostly
about religion and sex. But among the cultural elite these
were the deadest of dead letters by the 1980s; if you were
religious, or a virgin, this was something you tended to
conceal rather than advertise. So the sort of people who
enjoy being moral enforcers had become starved of things to
enforce. A new set of rules was just what they'd been
waiting for.Curiously enough, the tolerant side of the 1960s left helped
create the conditions in which the intolerant side
prevailed. The relaxed social rules advocated by the old,
easy-going hippy left became the dominant ones, at least
among the elite, and this left nothing for the naturally
intolerant to be intolerant about.Another possibly contributing factor was the fall of the
Soviet empire. Marxism had been a popular focus of moral
purity on the left before political correctness emerged as a
competitor, but the pro-democracy movements in Eastern Bloc
countries took most of the shine off it. Especially the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989. You couldn't be on the side of
the Stasi. I remember looking at the moribund Soviet Studies
section of a used bookshop in Cambridge in the late 1980s
and thinking "what will those people go on about now?" As it
turned out the answer was right under my nose.One thing I noticed at the time about the first phase of
political correctness was that it was more popular with
women than men. As many writers (perhaps most eloquently
George Orwell) have observed, women seem more attracted than
men to the idea of being moral enforcers. But there was
another more specific reason women tended to be the
enforcers of political correctness. There was at this time a
great backlash against sexual harassment; the mid 1980s were
the point when the definition of sexual harassment was
expanded from explicit sexual advances to creating a
"hostile environment." Within universities the classic form
of accusation was for a (female) student to say that a
professor made her "feel uncomfortable." But the vagueness
of this accusation allowed the radius of forbidden behavior
to expand to include talking about heterodox ideas. Those
make people uncomfortable too.
Was it sexist to propose that Darwin's greater male
variability hypothesis might explain some variation in human
performance? Sexist enough to get Larry Summers pushed out
as president of Harvard, apparently. One woman who heard the
talk in which he mentioned this idea said it made her feel
"physically ill" and that she had to leave halfway through.
If the test of a hostile environment is how it makes people
feel, this certainly sounds like one. And yet it does seem
plausible that greater male variability explains some of the
variation in human performance. So which should prevail,
comfort or truth? Surely if truth should prevail anywhere,
it should be in universities; that's supposed to be their
specialty; but for decades starting in the late 1980s the
politically correct tried to pretend this conflict didn't
exist.
Political correctness seemed to burn out in the second half
of the 1990s. One reason, perhaps the main reason, was that
it literally became a joke. It offered rich material for
comedians, who performed their usual disinfectant action
upon it. Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against
priggishness of any sort, because prigs, being humorless,
can't respond in kind. Humor was what defeated Victorian
prudishness, and by 2000 it seemed to have done the same
thing to political correctness.Unfortunately this was an illusion. Within universities the
embers of political correctness were still glowing brightly.
After all, the forces that created it were still there. The
professors who started it were now becoming deans and
department heads. And in addition to their departments there
were now a bunch of new ones explicitly focused on social
justice. Students were still hungry for things to be morally
pure about. And there had been an explosion in the number of
university administrators, many of whose jobs involved
enforcing various forms of political correctness.In the early 2010s the embers of political correctness burst
into flame anew. There were several differences between this
new phase and the original one. It was more virulent. It
spread further into the real world, although it still burned
hottest within universities. And it was concerned with a
wider variety of sins. In the first phase of political
correctness there were really only three things people got
accused of: sexism, racism, and homophobia (which at the
time was a neologism invented for the purpose). But between
then and 2010 a lot of people had spent a lot of time trying
to invent new kinds of -isms and -phobias and seeing which
could be made to stick.The second phase was, in multiple senses, political
correctness metastasized. Why did it happen when it did? My
guess is that it was due to the rise of social media,
particularly Tumblr and Twitter, because one of the most
distinctive features of the second wave of political
correctness was the : a mob of angry people
uniting on social media to get someone ostracized or fired.
Indeed this second wave of political correctness was
originally called "cancel culture"; it didn't start to be
called "wokeness" till the 2020s.One aspect of social media that surprised almost everyone at
first was the popularity of outrage. Users seemed to 
being outraged. We're so used to this idea now that we take
it for granted, but really it's pretty strange. Being
outraged is not a pleasant feeling. You wouldn't expect
people to seek it out. But they do. And above all, they want
to share it. I happened to be running a forum from 2007 to
2014, so I can actually quantify how much they want to share
it: our users were about three times more likely to upvote
something if it outraged them.This tilt toward outrage wasn't due to wokeness. It's an
inherent feature of social media, or at least this
generation of it. But it did make social media the perfect
mechanism for fanning the flames of wokeness.
It wasn't just public social networks that drove the rise of
wokeness though. Group chat apps were also critical,
especially in the final step, cancellation. Imagine if a
group of employees trying to get someone fired had to do it
using only email. It would be hard to organize a mob. But
once you have group chat, mobs form naturally.Another contributing factor in this second wave of political
correctness was the dramatic increase in the polarization of
the press. In the print era, newspapers were constrained to
be, or at least seem, politically neutral. The department
stores that ran ads in the New York Times wanted to reach
everyone in the region, both liberal and conservative, so
the Times had to serve both. But the Times didn't regard
this neutrality as something forced upon them. They embraced
it as their duty as a  — as one of the big
newspapers that aimed to be chronicles of their times,
reporting every sufficiently important story from a neutral
point of view.When I grew up the papers of record seemed timeless, almost
sacred institutions. Papers like the New York Times and
Washington Post had immense prestige, partly because other
sources of news were limited, but also because they did make
some effort to be neutral.Unfortunately it turned out that the paper of record was
mostly an artifact of the constraints imposed by print.

When your market was determined by geography, you had
to be neutral. But publishing online enabled — in fact
probably forced — newspapers to switch to serving markets
defined by ideology instead of geography. Most that remained
in business fell in the direction they'd already been
leaning: left. On October 11, 2020 the New York Times
announced that "The paper is in the midst of an evolution
from the stodgy paper of record into a juicy collection of
great narratives."

Meanwhile journalists, of a sort,
had arisen to serve the right as well. And so journalism,
which in the previous era had been one of the great
centralizing forces, now became one of the great polarizing
ones.The rise of social media and the increasing polarization of
journalism reinforced one another. In fact there arose a new
variety of journalism involving a loop through social media.
Someone would say something controversial on social media.
Within hours it would become a news story. Outraged readers
would then post links to the story on social media, driving
further arguments online. It was the cheapest source of
clicks imaginable. You didn't have to maintain overseas news
bureaus or pay for month-long investigations. All you had to
do was watch Twitter for controversial remarks and repost
them on your site, with some additional comments to inflame
readers further.For the press there was money in wokeness. But they weren't
the only ones. That was one of the biggest differences
between the two waves of political correctness: the first
was driven almost entirely by amateurs, but the second was
often driven by professionals. For some it was their whole
job. By 2010 a new class of administrators had arisen whose
job was basically to enforce wokeness. They played a role
similar to that of the political commissars who got attached
to military and industrial organizations in the USSR: they
weren't directly in the flow of the organization's work, but
watched from the side to ensure that nothing improper
happened in the doing of it. These new administrators could
often be recognized by the word "inclusion" in their titles.
Within institutions this was the preferred euphemism for
wokeness; a new list of banned words, for example, would
usually be called an "inclusive language guide."
This new class of bureaucrats pursued a woke agenda as if
their jobs depended on it, because they did. If you hire
people to keep watch for a particular type of problem,
they're going to find it, because otherwise there's no
justification for their existence.

But these
bureaucrats also represented a second and possibly even
greater danger. Many were involved in hiring, and when
possible they tried to ensure their employers hired only
people who shared their political beliefs. The most
egregious cases were the new "DEI statements" that some
universities started to require from faculty candidates,
proving their commitment to wokeness. Some universities used
these statements as the initial filter and only even
considered candidates who scored high enough on them. You're
not hiring Einstein that way; imagine what you get instead.Another factor in the rise of wokeness was the Black Lives
Matter movement, which started in 2013 when a white man was
acquitted after killing a black teenager in Florida. But
this didn't launch wokeness; it was well underway by 2013.Similarly for the Me Too Movement, which took off in 2017
after the first news stories about Harvey Weinstein's
history of raping women. It accelerated wokeness, but didn't
play the same role in launching it that the 80s version did
in launching political correctness.The election of Donald Trump in 2016 also accelerated
wokeness, particularly in the press, where outrage now meant
traffic. Trump made the New York Times a lot of money:
headlines during his first administration mentioned his name
at about four times the rate of previous presidents.In 2020 we saw the biggest accelerant of all, after a white
police officer asphyxiated a black suspect on video. At this
point the metaphorical fire became a literal one, as violent
protests broke out across America. But in retrospect this
turned out to be peak woke, or close to it. By every measure
I've seen, wokeness peaked in 2020 or 2021.Wokeness is sometimes described as a mind-virus. What makes
it viral is that it defines new types of impropriety. Most
people are afraid of impropriety; they're never exactly sure
what the social rules are or which ones they might be
breaking. Especially if the rules change rapidly. And since
most people already worry that they might be breaking rules
they don't know about, if you tell them they're breaking a
rule, their default reaction is to believe you. Especially
if multiple people tell them. Which in turn is a recipe for
exponential growth. Zealots invent some new impropriety to
avoid. The first people to adopt it are fellow zealots,
eager for new ways to signal their virtue. If there are
enough of these, the initial group of zealots is followed by
a much larger group, motivated by fear. They're not trying
to signal virtue; they're just trying to avoid getting in
trouble. At this point the new impropriety is now firmly
established. Plus its success has increased the rate of
change in social rules, which, remember, is one of the
reasons people are nervous about which rules they might be
breaking. So the cycle accelerates.
What's true of individuals is even more true of
organizations. Especially organizations without a powerful
leader. Such organizations do everything based on "best
practices." There's no higher authority; if some new "best
practice" achieves critical mass, they  adopt it. And
in this case the organization can't do what it usually does
when it's uncertain: delay. It might be committing
improprieties right now! So it's surprisingly easy for a
small group of zealots to capture this type of organization
by describing new improprieties it might be guilty of. 
How does this kind of cycle ever end? Eventually it leads to
disaster, and people start to say enough is enough. The
excesses of 2020 made a lot of people say that.Since then wokeness has been in gradual but continual
retreat. Corporate CEOs, starting with Brian Armstrong, have
openly rejected it. Universities, led by the University of
Chicago and MIT, have explicitly confirmed their commitment
to free speech. Twitter, which was arguably the hub of
wokeness, was bought by Elon Musk in order to neutralize it,
and he seems to have succeeded — and not, incidentally, by
censoring left-wing users the way Twitter used to censor
right-wing ones, but without censoring either.

Consumers have emphatically rejected brands that ventured
too far into wokeness. The Bud Light brand may have been
permanently damaged by it. I'm not going to claim Trump's
second victory in 2024 was a referendum on wokeness; I think
he won, as presidential candidates always do, because he was
more ; but voters' 
disgust with wokeness must have helped.So what do we do now? Wokeness is already in retreat.
Obviously we should help it along. What's the best way to do
that? And more importantly, how do we avoid a third
outbreak? After all, it seemed to be dead once, but came
back worse than ever.In fact there's an even more ambitious goal: is there a way
to prevent any similar outbreak of aggressively performative
moralism in the future — not just a third outbreak of
political correctness, but the next thing like it? Because
there will be a next thing. Prigs are prigs by nature. They
need rules to obey and enforce, and now that Darwin has cut
off their traditional supply of rules, they're constantly
hungry for new ones. All they need is someone to meet them
halfway by defining a new way to be morally pure, and we'll
see the same phenomenon again.Let's start with the easier problem. Is there a simple,
principled way to deal with wokeness? I think there is: to
use the customs we already have for dealing with religion.
Wokeness is effectively a religion, just with God replaced
by protected classes. It's not even the first religion of
this kind; Marxism had a similar form, with God replaced by
the masses.

And we already have well-established
customs for dealing with religion within organizations. You
can express your own religious identity and explain your
beliefs, but you can't call your coworkers infidels if they
disagree, or try to ban them from saying things that
contradict its doctrines, or insist that the organization
adopt yours as its official religion.If we're not sure what to do about any particular
manifestation of wokeness, imagine we were dealing with some
other religion, like Christianity. Should we have people
within organizations whose jobs are to enforce woke
orthodoxy? No, because we wouldn't have people whose jobs
were to enforce Christian orthodoxy. Should we censor
 or 
 whose work contradicts woke doctrines?
No, because we wouldn't do this to people whose work
contradicted Christian teachings. Should job candidates be
required to write DEI statements? Of course not; imagine an
employer requiring proof of one's religious beliefs. Should
students and employees have to participate in woke
indoctrination sessions in which they're required to answer
questions about their beliefs to ensure compliance? No,
because we wouldn't dream of catechizing people in this way
about their religion.
One shouldn't feel bad about not wanting to watch woke
movies any more than one would feel bad about not wanting to
listen to Christian rock. In my twenties I drove across
America several times, listening to local radio stations.
Occasionally I'd turn the dial and hear some new song. But
the moment anyone mentioned Jesus I'd turn the dial again.
Even the tiniest bit of being preached to was enough to make
me lose interest.But by the same token we should not automatically reject
everything the woke believe. I'm not a Christian, but I can
see that many Christian principles are good ones. It would
be a mistake to discard them all just because one didn't
share the religion that espoused them. It would be the sort
of thing a religious zealot would do.If we have genuine pluralism, I think we'll be safe from
future outbreaks of woke intolerance. Wokeness itself won't
go away. There will for the foreseeable future continue to
be pockets of woke zealots inventing new moral fashions. The
key is not to let them treat their fashions as normative.
They can change what their coreligionists are allowed to say
every few months if they like, but they mustn't be allowed
to change what we're allowed to say.
The more general problem — how to prevent similar outbreaks
of aggressively performative moralism — is of course
harder. Here we're up against human nature. There will
always be prigs. And in particular there will always be the
enforcers among them, the 
aggressively conventional-minded.
These people are born that way. Every society has them. So
the best we can do is to keep them bottled up.The aggressively conventional-minded aren't always on the
rampage. Usually they just enforce whatever random rules are
nearest to hand. They only become dangerous when some new
ideology gets a lot of them pointed in the same direction at
once. That's what happened during the Cultural Revolution,
and to a lesser extent (thank God) in the two waves of
political correctness we've experienced.We can't get rid of the aggressively conventional-minded.

And we couldn't prevent people from creating new
ideologies that appealed to them even if we wanted to. So if
we want to keep them bottled up, we have to do it one step
downstream. Fortunately when the aggressively
conventional-minded go on the rampage they always do one
thing that gives them away: they define new  to
punish people for. So the best way to protect ourselves from
future outbreaks of things like wokeness is to have powerful
antibodies against the concept of heresy.We should have a conscious bias against defining new forms
of heresy. Whenever anyone tries to ban saying something
that we'd previously been able to say, our initial
assumption should be that they're wrong. Only our initial
assumption of course. If they can prove we should stop
saying it, then we should. But the burden of proof is on
them. In liberal democracies, people trying to prevent
something from being said will usually claim they're not
merely engaging in censorship, but trying to prevent some
form of "harm". And maybe they're right. But once again, the
burden of proof is on them. It's not enough to claim harm;
they have to prove it.As long as the aggressively conventional-minded continue to
give themselves away by banning heresies, we'll always be
able to notice when they become aligned behind some new
ideology. And if we always fight back at that point, with
any luck we can stop them in their tracks.The number of true things we 
should not increase. If it does, something is wrong.]
Why did 1960s radicals focus on the causes they did?
One of the people who reviewed drafts of this essay
explained this so well that I asked if I could quote him:

  The middle-class student protestors of the New Left
  rejected the socialist/Marxist left as unhip. They were
  interested in sexier forms of oppression uncovered by
  cultural analysis (Marcuse) and abstruse "Theory". Labor
  politics became stodgy and old-fashioned. This took a
  couple generations to work through. The woke ideology's
  conspicuous lack of interest in the working class is the
  tell-tale sign. Such fragments as are, er, left of the old
  left are anti-woke, and meanwhile the actual working class
  shifted to the populist right and gave us Trump. Trump and
  wokeness are cousins.The middle-class origins of wokeness smoothed its way
  through the institutions because it had no interest in
  "seizing the means of production" (how quaint such phrases
  seem now), which would quickly have run up against hard
  state and corporate power. The fact that wokeness only
  expressed interest in other kinds of class (race, sex,
  etc) signalled compromise with existing power: give us
  power within your system and we'll bestow the resource we
  control — moral rectitude — upon you. As an ideological
  stalking horse for gaining control over discourse and
  institutions, this succeeded where a more ambitious
  revolutionary program would not have.

It helped that the humanities and social sciences also
included some of the biggest and easiest undergrad majors.
If a political movement had to start with physics students,
it could never get off the ground; there would be too few of
them, and they wouldn't have the time to spare.At the top universities these majors are not as big as they
used to be, though. A 
 found that only 7% of
Harvard undergrads plan to major in the humanities, vs
nearly 30% during the 1970s. I expect wokeness is at least
part of the reason; when undergrads consider majoring in
English, it's presumably because they love the written word
and not because they want to listen to lectures about
racism.]
The puppet-master-and-puppet character of political
correctness became clearly visible when a bakery near
Oberlin College was falsely accused of race discrimination
in 2016. In the subsequent civil trial, lawyers for the
bakery produced a text message from Oberlin Dean of Students
Meredith Raimondo that read "I'd say unleash the students if
I wasn't convinced this needs to be put behind us."]
The woke sometimes claim that wokeness is simply
treating people with respect. But if it were, that would be
the only rule you'd have to remember, and this is comically
far from being the case. My younger son likes to imitate
voices, and at one point when he was about seven I had to
explain which accents it was currently safe to imitate
publicly and which not. It took about ten minutes, and I
still hadn't covered all the cases.]
In 1986 the Supreme Court ruled that creating a
hostile work environment could constitute sex
discrimination, which in turn affected universities via
Title IX. The court specified that the test of a hostile
environment was whether it would bother a reasonable person,
but since for a professor merely being the subject of a
sexual harassment complaint would be a disaster whether the
complainant was reasonable or not, in practice any joke or
remark remotely connected with sex was now effectively
forbidden. Which meant we'd now come full circle to
Victorian codes of behavior, when there was a large class of
things that might not be said "with ladies present."]
Much as they tried to pretend there was no conflict
between diversity and quality. But you can't simultaneously
optimize for two things that aren't identical. What
diversity actually means, judging from the way the term is
used, is proportional representation, and unless you're
selecting a group whose purpose is to be representative,
like poll respondents, optimizing for proportional
representation has to come at the expense of quality. This
is not because of anything about representation; it's the
nature of optimization; optimizing for x has to come at the
expense of y unless x and y are identical.]
Maybe societies will eventually develop antibodies to
viral outrage. Maybe we were just the first to be exposed to
it, so it tore through us like an epidemic through a
previously isolated population. I'm fairly confident that it
would be possible to create new social media apps that were
less driven by outrage, and an app of this type would have a
good chance of stealing users from existing ones, because
the smartest people would tend to migrate to it.]
I say "mostly" because I have hopes that journalistic
neutrality will return in some form. There is some market
for unbiased news, and while it may be small, it's valuable.
The rich and powerful want to know what's really going on;
that's how they became rich and powerful.]
The Times made this momentous announcement very
informally, in passing in the middle of an 
 about a
Times reporter who'd been criticized for inaccuracy. It's
quite possible no senior editor even approved it. But it's
somehow appropriate that this particular universe ended with
a whimper rather than a bang.]
As the acronym DEI goes out of fashion, many of these
bureaucrats will try to go underground by changing their
titles. It looks like "belonging" will be a popular option.]
If you've ever wondered why our legal system includes
protections like the separation of prosecutor, judge, and
jury, the right to examine evidence and cross-examine
witnesses, and the right to be represented by legal counsel,
the de facto 
parallel legal system
established by Title IX
makes that all too clear.]
The invention of new improprieties is most visible in
the rapid evolution of woke nomenclature. This is
particularly annoying to me as a writer, because the new
names are always worse. Any religious observance has to be
inconvenient and slightly absurd; otherwise gentiles would
do it too. So "slaves" becomes "enslaved individuals." But
web search can show us the leading edge of moral growth in
real time: if you search for "individuals experiencing
slavery" you will as of this writing find five legit
attempts to use the phrase, and you'll even find two for
"individuals experiencing enslavement."]
Organizations that do dubious things are particularly
concerned with propriety, which is how you end up with
absurdities like tobacco and oil companies having higher ESG
ratings than Tesla.]
Elon did something else that tilted Twitter rightward
though: he gave more visibility to paying users. Paying
users lean right on average, because people on the far left
dislike Elon and don't want to give him money. Elon
presumably knew this would happen. On the other hand, the
people on the far left have only themselves to blame; they
could tilt Twitter back to the left tomorrow if they wanted
to.]
It even, as James Lindsay and Peter Boghossian
pointed out, has a concept of original sin: privilege. Which
means unlike Christianity's egalitarian version, people have varying
degrees of it. An able-bodied straight white
American male is born with such a load of sin that only by
the most abject repentance can he be saved.Wokeness also shares something rather funny with many actual
versions of Christianity: like God, the people for whose
sake wokeness purports to act are often revolted by the
things done in their name.]
There is one exception to most of these rules: actual
religious organizations. It's reasonable for them to insist
on orthodoxy. But they in turn should declare that they're
religious organizations. It's rightly considered shady
when something that appears to be an ordinary business or
publication turns out to be a religious organization.]
I don't want to give the impression that it will be
simple to roll back wokeness. There will be places where the
fight inevitably gets messy — particularly within
universities, which everyone has to share, yet which are
currently the most pervaded by wokeness of any institutions.]
You can however get rid of aggressively
conventional-minded people within an organization, and in
many if not most organizations this would be an excellent
idea. Even a handful of them can do a lot of damage. I bet
you'd feel a noticeable improvement going from a handful to
none.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Oracle Won&apos;t Withdraw &apos;JavaScript&apos; Trademark, Says Deno. Legal Skirmish Continues</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0323229/oracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Oracle has informed us they won't voluntarily withdraw their trademark on 'JavaScript'." That's the word coming from the company behind Deno, the alternative JavaScript/TypeScript/WebAssembly runtime, which is pursuing a formal cancellation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

So what happens next? Oracle "will file their Answer, and we'll start discovery to show how 'JavaScript' is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle." Deno's social media posts show a schedule of various court dates that extend through July of 2026, so "The dispute between Oracle and Deno Land could go on for quite a while," reports InfoWorld:
Deno Land co-founder Ryan Dahl, creator of both the Deno and Node.js runtimes, said a formal answer from Oracle is expected before February 3, unless Oracle extends the deadline again. "After that, we will begin the process of discovery, which is where the real legal work begins. It will be interesting to see how Oracle argues against our claims — genericide, fraud on the USPTO, and non-use of the mark." 

The legal process begins with a discovery conference by March 5, with discovery closing by September 1, followed by pretrial disclosure from October 16 to December 15. An optional request for an oral hearing is due by July 8, 2026. 

Oracle took ownership of JavaScript's trademark in 2009 when it purchased Sun Microsystems, InfoWorld notes. 

But "Oracle does not control (and has never controlled) any aspect of the specification or how the phrase 'JavaScript' can be used by others," argues an official petition filed by Deno Land Inc. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
Today, millions of companies, universities, academics, and programmers, including Petitioner, use "JavaScript" daily without any involvement with Oracle. The phrase "JavaScript" does not belong to one corporation. It belongs to the public. JavaScript is the generic name for one of the bedrock languages of modern programming, and, therefore, the Registered Mark must be canceled. 

An open letter to Oracle discussing the genericness of the phrase "JavaScript," published at https://javascript.tm/, was signed by 14,000+ individuals at the time of this Petition to Cancel, including notable figures such as Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and the current editors of the JavaScript specification, Michael Ficarra and Shu-yu Guo. There is broad industry and public consensus that the term "JavaScript" is generic. 

The seven-page petition goes into great detail, reports InfoWorld. "Deno Land also accused Oracle of committing fraud in its trademark renewal efforts in 2019 by submitting screen captures of the website of JavaScript runtime Node.js, even though Node.js was not affiliated with Oracle."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Why Did I Survive?’: Altadena Residents Return Home Amid L.A.

Pensions that predate the 20th century can generally be found at the National Archives (NARA), organized by conflict, and include voluminous tomes of information about pensioners from the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, etc. These pension files have been indexed online, and many of the files themselves have been digitized as well.But where are the files for the veterans who served in later conflicts? Their records lie in what are called the XC Pension Files, which by and large still live untapped, under the custody of the Veterans Benefits Administration (the VBA), a subdivision of the VA, hidden away in 1.1 million boxes at Federal Records Centers scattered throughout the country.In 1917, as World War I was ending, the US instituted a modernization of their veterans pension system. Veterans Claims Files (called C-Files, but not to be confused with USCIS' C-Files) were created, with one claims file for every veteran who filed with the federal government for benefits. Every veteran was assigned a claims number (or C-Number), and a file was created containing materials about their service, family, medical care, and benefits.A veteran would apply for benefits via his local VA Field Office (or whatever predecessor locations were called) at some point after his separation from the service, and they would store the records there. A Field Office would periodically retire files when they were no longer needed for active agency use. Generally this would correspond to when nobody was claiming benefits from that veteran any longer, in other words, when the veteran and his dependents had died. When a veteran died, their file would be denoted an XC pension, and their VA Master Index Card would often be updated as well, to show that the veteran was deceased.Field Offices would periodically send boxes of these now-inactive files to Federal Records Centers (FRC), a system of warehouses all over the country maintained by NARA. Whenever the FRC would accession boxes from a particular Field Office, they would be assigned an Accession Number, possibly reboxed, and files would generally be organized by their “terminal digit,” a system of organization many federal agencies used during the 20th century. It is unknown how many files there are exactly, but there could easily be 5-20 files per cubic foot, meaning that there are likely tens of millions of deceased veterans' files in total across the FRCs.The Veterans Administration Master Index (VAMI): the 1917-1940 seriesIn 1930, the various agencies that administered these benefits were merged into the Veterans Administration, and they subsequently undertook a project to create a Master Index of their many types of files, thus creating the Veterans Administration Master Index (VAMI). The VAMI indexed various records series, such as service records and pension files and life insurance policies and educational records, some of which no longer survive, except as noted on the index.The first consolidation of this index was actively maintained until 1940, and it cataloged veterans who had active claims (that is, files which were still open, perhaps providing benefits to their heirs) between 1917 to 1940, although subsequent annotations were made in the index in later decades (sometimes written in pencil on the cards), before the series of the 1917-1940 cards were eventually microfilmed in the 1960s.Those hundreds of microfilm reels were then stored at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) facility in St. Louis, Missouri -- but not the main NARA facility in Washington DC, and not online anywhere. Despite having an incredible wealth of information, their existence were not well-known to researchers. Then about five years ago, the non-profit organization Reclaim the Records -- who also built this website here -- became aware of the value of the reels thanks to a military historian on its board of directors. They worked with the non-profit organization FamilySearch to finally get those reels digitized and freely published, for public use. FamilySearch even created the first-ever text transcription of some of the fields of data on the card images, including names, birthdates, service dates, and hometowns or residences of the veterans. Here is the VAMI entry in FamilySearch's Catalog.Following the new digitization, the records were also finally added to NARA's own online Catalog; here is the entry for the VAMI in the NARA Catalog, which also contains the scanned images. The commercial genealogy company Ancestry.com has also inputted a scrape of FamilySearch's text database of the VAMI Cards into their system, but they do not have the underlying images.The Veterans Administration Master Index (VAMI): the post-1940 seriesSoldiers who had claims active after 1940 were put into a different subseries of index, running through the late 1970s. This index is also stored at NARA St Louis and it has been digitized, but has not been made available to the public in bulk because it contains personally identifiable information about many living soldiers. However, it is important to note that NARA can do lookups of specific cards in this series for specific veterans, if asked by a researcher.Because of the 1973 fire at the National Personnel Records Center that destroyed millions of 20th century Official Military Personnel Files (OMPFs), the VAMI serves as one of the most accessible sources to indicate if someone served in the early-mid 20th century. It is not exhaustive, however, as the VAMI is an index of veterans who claimed VA benefits, and not of all veterans. Most soldiers wanted their benefits and pensions, but filing a claim was not obligatory, and some people may have not done so, or may not have been eligible for benefits.While the now-digitized 1917-1940 VAMI series includes primarily WWI and Spanish-American War veterans, there were still living soldiers or dependents from prior conflicts as well, meaning that files from other wars were still considered active. These pensions became rolled into the modern C-File system. In other words, many Civil War Veterans whose pensions were still being paid in the 20th century, had their pension files taken from the Civil War Pension Files series, and consolidated into the modern C-Files series. These records subsequently often did not transfer to NARA, even though they pertain to an individual who was born more than 150 years ago. This is apparent if a Civil War solider appears in the VAMI. It's possible that in later years, a Civil War solder's file did move to NARA though, as the index has been static microfilm for more than half a century.The Index Card itself is very valuable, because it contains many biographical details about the veteran, and is easily accessible online for free. In addition to containing the solider's name, date of birth, and C-Number, it includes their enlistment and discharge dates, their service number, their address (there is some debate as to when the listed address is from, but  address of the veteran is there), the unit in which they served, their rank, and often their date of death. There are a number of codes that are also included, but these generally do not lead to surviving files. NARA has a detailed description about what the codes indicate here. The later VAMI cards look substantially the same, although they were microfilmed terribly, and are often barely legible.Enter BIRLS. In the 1980s, The VA decided to modernize their systems, and created a database, the Beneficiary Identification Records Locator Subsystem (or  for short), rather than the paper index cards of the VAMI. This new BIRLS database aspired to input all of the information contained in the VAMI so as to render the index cards redundant.But once again, much like the earlier Veterans Administration Master Index before it, BIRLS is a database of veterans who claimed (or whose heirs claimed) some kind of service-related benefit through the VA in the past half-century or so, and it is not a comprehensive data set of every veteran. Many veterans who did not have any contact with the VA (and whose families did not either) within the past forty to fifty years will not be included in BIRLS, although the VA may indeed still have some records about them, which would potentially be accessible to a researcher under the Freedom of Information Act.While the VA originally planned to accomplish a comprehensive review of their files in the 1980s, their goal was never fully realized, and BIRLS only exists as a partial index to claimants, as they never fully backfilled the early 20th century veterans. It contains nearly every claimant whose file has been active in the last 40-50 years, along with many older ones. Because these files generally remain open until the death of the veteran and their spouse, many WWI (and even Civil War) veterans do appear in BIRLS. A WWI solder could have been born in 1890, and died in 1980, well into the era of automation. Had he had a spouse who was considerably younger, the file could have yet remained open for decades further. As a general rule,  WWII and later veterans who claimed benefits would be in BIRLS. While WWI soldiers are not guaranteed to be listed in BIRLS, they are exhaustively indexed in the earlier VAMI.For later veterans who aren't in BIRLS, it's always possible to email NARA St Louis and have them search for a VAMI card from the later not-yet-published series. Additionally, the BIRLS database extract that is available online here, both for search and for download, only contains information for people for whom the VA was able to confirm the veteran was deceased as of 2020. It's possible that a veteran's name might be listed in the full and unredacted version of the BIRLS database that is still held at the VA, but if the veteran was not yet known to the VA as having died, the information was not provided here.Furthermore, not every single BIRLS entry corresponds to a Claims File (C-File), but the majority do. It's possible that someone could be listed in BIRLS who had a different type of file, generally one that has been destroyed, although occasionally the VA has something else, such as an insurance file.Using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for Deceased Veterans' FilesOnce you've found someone of interest listed in the VAMI index cards or the BIRLS database, the next step is to request a copy of their Claims File (C-File) from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) sub-agency within the Veterans Administration, through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). For these types of files, and for this particular agency, the best way to submit your FOIA request is via fax - The VBA recently stopped accepting emailed FOIA requests for files, and anecdotally, even FOIA requests that get mailed on paper often do not get processed properly. (Yes, this is a violation of the more than fifty-year-old law.) The VBA's Centralized Support Division is the office that processes these requests, and their workflow is simply not well-oiled to manage FOIA requests. They are used to processing requests by veterans and their next-of-kin for files, but not from the general public. Not many researchers and genealogists had been making requests for these Claims Files, because they usually had no easy access to the underlying indices or database, and no easy way to make a request for the C-File to the agency even if they did find someone's name - until now.This new BIRLS website enables researchers to not only search through the previously-inaccessible BIRLS database -- or rather, the portion of that database where the VA has determined the veteran is deceased -- and even download the raw data set, if preferred. But better yet, researchers can now use the search results on this website to build and launch their own FOIA request, right from their web browser, creating and sending a personalized FOIA request to the VBA via fax, using an online fax API system, thereby circumventing the agency's general FOIA non-compliance.Because the agency is not used to processing large numbers of FOIA requests from the general public, the responses that researchers and genealogists have gotten from these FOIA requests are often a bit messy. The VBA sometimes can't find files on the first try, or they may try to send out partial files, or they might redact things they shouldn't redact, especially on a deceased person's record where there should be few or no privacy concerns.Under FOIA, agencies can generally only provide records about deceased individuals, but there is widely followed case law that allows agencies to presume death, if the individual was born more than 100 years ago.Best practices would be to include proof of death of the subject of record, their spouse, and anyone else thought to be mentioned in the file, so as to avoid any possible redactions. For the case of veterans who served in the early 20th century, this is less relevant, but if someone were to request a file someone who only died recently, this would be more important.In the cases in which a file is not properly produced, it is necessary to file a FOIA appeal to the VA's Office of General Counsel at this email address: . Provide a copy of the response letter, and explain why the search / production was deficient.In the cases where they say a file cannot be found, attach a copy of the BIRLS entry or the VAMI Card, to show that a file should exist. If redactions were made improperly, call out what pages have things that should be unmasked. If they left out pages, tell them!The Appeals Office is usually able to handle these issues promptly, and can instruct the VBA to properly process the request. In cases where the record truly cannot be found, they will provide more of an explanation about why.Once the VBA  sends out a file, the results can be glorious.What to Expect in the Claims File (C-File)These files can be a goldmine for a genealogist, historian, journalist, or other researcher. They often include records from the veteran's civilian life that may be annoying or even otherwise impossible to obtain.There may be copies of vital records, meaning birth, baptismal, marriage, divorce, or death certificates. There may even be records of formal or informal name changes, to justify why benefits are going to someone who served under a different name.The documents will often talk about the veteran's next of kin: generally a spouse or a child. They often ask for parents' and siblings' names and biographical information. One file we've seen even had a whole chain of correspondence with an immigrant veteran's mother back in Italy, who was being paid some sort of allowance while her son was enlisted.There is often a lot of content discussing medical treatment, which often show the extent of the service member's war or training injuries, and often their end of life care. There are letters from doctors, medical exam results, reports about surgeries, things that will never exist anywhere else.The files do not usually have a significant amount of material from the OMPF, but there will almost always be a copy of the record of discharge. In the post-WWII era, this means the DD-214, but other forms were used before that. The DD-214 provides a decent summary of the service, any awards received, and employment information. Occasionally, large portions of the OMPF will be copied in this file, and it's very common to at least have a handful of pages of the OMPF be present.The bulk of the file is often fairly mundane, and concerns financial calculations of benefits, but these files are lengthy. While they are sometimes only a dozen pages or so, the majority of the claims files are 100-400 pages long, so even if 90% is banal, the remaining 10% can still be substantial. The photos and scans included at the top of this website, with their diverse and sometimes very interesting material, all came from papers provided in previous FOIA requests for these types of C-Files.It is absolutely worth submitting a FOIA request to the VBA for any veteran who is a research interest - even if they don't appear in the VAMI cards or the BIRLS database (although that probably indicates there is no file). After all, merely submitting a FOIA request is free!Why Are Almost All Claim Files Still Held at the VA and not at NARA?Considering how historic and unique and massive these files are, one may wonder why they are languishing at the VA. This is going to change, but not anytime soon.In 2010, the VA and NARA signed a disposition agreement, memorialized by the Standard Form (SF) 115, which states that the VA will send retired boxes to FRCs annually, and that sixty years from the date of retirement, the boxes will transfer into NARA's custody, who could then serve the boxes to patrons at NARA. And in fact, tens of thousands of cubic feet have transferred. For the files that have not, access is supposed to be granted via the VA, although anecdotal evidence suggests that NARA has informally facilitated access to these files as well.For now, it's best to assume that any desired file is still in the custody of the VA, as the files that NARA legally controls represent less than 5% of the total. As time goes on, more accession with move to NARA, but because NARA does not have a complete index of their holdings, they are not able to make these readily available. The only way to know who has it, is to specifically ask.What to do if you can't find a veteran's name in the BIRLS databaseThe BIRLS database is  a comprehensive database of all American veterans, but rather a partial and incomplete index of veterans who were eligible for VA benefits or whose heirs had some kind of contact with the VA regarding benefits. Furthermore, the version of the BIRLS database on this website only includes the names of people who were  to the VA to have been deceased at the time when Reclaim The Records won their FOIA lawsuit in 2020, with the subset of the database being exported and turned over in mid-2022.That being said, almost all veterans who served in the late nineteenth or twentieth centuries probably do (or did) have  of claims file stored with the VA, likely in one (or more) of their warehouses, and that file may simply have never been indexed for inclusion in BIRLS. This is especially likely if the veteran (or their heirs) had no contact with the VA after the database first started being compiled and computerized in the 1980s.If you cannot find a known-deceased military veteran's name or information in the BIRLS database, but you still want to  to get a copy of their full claims file, there are a few steps you can take to try to get the VA to dig deeper and attempt to locate their records. It may not be as successful as a standard FOIA request based on known-extant BIRLS data, but it's still worth a shot. And in any case, it's free!Note that for these types of "build your own FOIA request" cases, where a veteran's name was never included in the BIRLS database (or at least not in the public version), the VA will need to do a more thorough search of their records to try to locate any surviving materials, and it may take many more months to receive a response. If they eventually tell you that they are unable to find any files, then you can (and should) file a free FOIA appeal with the VA's Office of General Counsel at this email address: . The Appeals Officer can instruct the VBA to re-run the search for you, or else explain more specifically why they believe the veteran's file truly is no longer extant.Examples of some famous deceased American military veterans (most of whom served in WWII or later) who are  listed in the BIRLS database include Humphrey Bogart, Yogi Berra, Woody Guthrie, Stan Lee, Henry Fonda, Jackie Robinson, Buddy Hackett, Jack Kerouac, Herman Wouk, Carroll O'Connor, Ralph Ellison, Harlan Ellison, Haskell Wexler, Peter Falk, James Garner, Lenny Bruce, and Kirk Douglas.(FOIA requests asking for copies of the C-Files for all of these veterans are currently in progress. 😉)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will Nvidia Spark a New Generation of Linux PCs?</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/006249/will-nvidia-spark-a-new-generation-of-linux-pcs?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 01:07:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["I know, I know: 'Year of the Linux desktop ... yadda, yadda'," writes Steven Vaughan-Nichols, a ZDNet senior contributing editor. "You've heard it all before. But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want..." 

He's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as "a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro."

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players — including Intel and AMD — in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Doom (1993) in a PDF</title><link>https://doompdf.pages.dev/doom.pdf</link><author>vk6</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:50:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roald Amundsen</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roald-amundsen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:05:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Lives Matter Rally (Dear Kelly Scene)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc5-B5AFpk</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 20:10:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DEAR KELLY will premiere in three days at 5:55 P.M.

Despite the rat plague and the typhoon risk. In New York City, too, there were simple dwellings for servants on rooftops - long before penthouses and rooftop bars came along.

Like thousands of other people in Hong Kong, Cheng Chung Au lives in an illegally constructed ‘cage flat’ on the roof of a high-rise building. Over the decades, he’s come to terms with the rats and the typhoons. He and his wife couldn’t afford a regular flat and the waiting lists for social housing are long.

Until the early 20th century, there was also a ‘city above the city’ in New York - for servants and workers. Then these very same spaces were developed into exclusive penthouse flats and rooftop bars. In the 1920s, plans for the Rockefeller Centre complex in Midtown Manhattan included rooftop gardens that were envisioned as a public park, with bridges to other buildings. The Great Depression prevented the project’s realization. 

Today, apartments on the upper levels of New York's mega-high-rise buildings are on the markets for hundreds of millions of dollars. In the future, newly constructed buildings with roof surfaces in the US metropolis will have to be greened or fitted with solar panels. Greenery can prevent sewers from overflowing during heavy rainfall. And the insulating effect of soil and vegetation saves cooling and heating energy. For activist Anastasia Cole Plakias, whose Brooklyn Grange is one of the largest rooftop farms in the US, the potential of green roofs is far from exhausted. 

Rooftops are extreme zones: A refuge for people looking for a home, and a testing ground for the city of the future.

Is atheism a belief system, a new ‘faith’ as it were, in the same way that atheists claim that theism is a belief system? Atheists reject this attack asserting that they are just using critical reasoning to expose irrational theism. What would make atheism is a new ‘faith’? Does atheism, like theism, have its own assumptions and ways of thinking?

ABSTRACT
In his book, Agile Design Patterns, Robert C. Martin introduces the #SOLID #DesignPrincipals as cornerstones for the construction of software that amenable to change.

Part of a larger set of design principals1, the SOLID principals are closely associated with object oriented languages like C++, Java, C#, and more recently Ruby. And although they span different eras, all these languages share the same class structured, inheritance based foundations.

#Go is one of a set of new languages that eschew inheritance, instead preferring the mantra of composition. Does this mean that Go programs do not follow the SOLID design principals, or even that Go is not an object oriented language?

In this talk I will explore the five core SOLID design patterns, discuss their applicability to Go programmers, and explain that while Go programs are not inheritance or class based, they adhere strongly to Martin’s principals. The audience will learn how well structured Go applications naturally follow the SOLID principals, leading to code which is loosely coupled, highly reusable, and inherently maintainable.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, joined by co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly, dives into the mysterious world of hypnosis with clinical psychiatrist David Spiegel. What is hypnosis? Is it about losing control—or gaining it?

We explore the human mind and consciousness, asking if there’s a “user manual” for our brains. How does hypnosis work? Dr. Spiegel explains how our salience network, which processes external stimuli, can be “turned down,” allowing us to engage deeply with our inner thoughts. Could this altered state offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?

Some are more hypnotizable than others—why? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic—targeted and potent, especially for managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well as for good? 

From recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis reveals its potential—and limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize medicine.

Toshiko Tanaka, then six years old, had survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. She hoped that this "peace constitution” would prevent wars in the future. But now, Japan is arming itself again.

After 1945, Japan was the only country in the world to commit itself to renouncing war in its constitution. But in the face of increasing dangers, the island nation has now announced a rearmament program. By the end of this decade, Japan could become the third strongest military power in the world. The pacifism born of the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has given way to fear of aggressive neighbors like China, Russia and North Korea.

Under conservative governments and in view of the increasing withdrawal of the once-protective USA, the Japanese armed forces have acquired weapons systems. These include amphibious vehicles, US F-35 fighter jets and two aircraft carriers. There is enough plutonium from civilian use in the country to produce up to a thousand nuclear warheads. Missile systems are also available.
Asia is the key to the future. This documentary shows a new side of Japan and provides insight into the military changes that are taking place there - far from the war in Ukraine. Toshiko Tanaka, one of the last hibakusha, as the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings are called, fears war once more.

Sentient suffering is a hard problem for theists to solve. The ‘free will defense,’ that privileges and blames human choice, claims to cover moral evil. But what about natural evil, such as animals being killed or eaten alive continuously during the process of evolution before humans? Shouldn’t egregious and relentless animal suffering count against God?

ABSTRACT
Moving to a microservice architecture and embracing a cloud native approach is a complex challenge, which often requires re-evaluating our approach to technology. Having previously helped transition Hailo to a a new microservice platform, built almost entirely in Go, Matt leverages modern technologies and a microservice based approach to build reliable platforms which can scale to millions of users. This talk will cover how to develop and migrate to a microservice based architecture using Go, common pitfalls to avoid, and lessons learnt when developing high volume, low latency, distributed applications.

Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.On June 13, 1863, a letter published in The Press newspaper of Christchurch warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently popped up again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the . The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Main character syndrome?

Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.My immediate reaction was “oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn’t that
hard, you just need to….”, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
“you just need to…” list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a “modern” terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.what is a “modern terminal experience”?Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:multiline support for copy and paste: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediatly run them all! That’s scary! (, ): if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (): I can’t live without having my  and  in my prompt (): this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours () between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press  in vim to paste (, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too): for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete () (): I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor’s theme. (, )automatic terminal fixing: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn’t get messed up (): I want  to work ( or )being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like : ( and )There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.how I achieve a “modern experience”use the  shell. Mostly don’t configure it, except to:
set the  environment variable to my favourite terminal editoruse any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I’ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I’m not picky about this. I don’t really
configure it other than to choose a font.use , with a configuration that I’ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)A few things that affect my approach:I don’t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machinesI’d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everythingI work on a lot of small projects, not one big projectsome “out of the box” options for a “modern” experienceWhat if you want a nice experience, but don’t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminalmac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn’t have 256-colour support)cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghosttyshell config:
set the  environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editormaybe alias  to text editor: this is a tough one, maybe micro or helix? I haven’t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it’s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
( to copy,  to paste,  to select all) in micro and
they do what you’d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn’t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.Personally I  use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I’ve found in the past that they’re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app’s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.I don’t want to pretend that getting a “modern” terminal experience is easier
than it is though – I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let’s talk
about them!issue 1 with getting to a “modern” experience: the shellbash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:you need to customize your promptthey don’t come with git completions by default, you have to set them upby default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lotI find bash’s tab completion very frustrating, if there’s more than
one match then you can’t tab through themAnd even though I love fish, the fact
that it isn’t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.Of course it’s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn’t even need to be that complicated (in bash I’d
probably start with something like export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ', or maybe use starship).
But each of these “not complicated” things really does add up and it’s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.An extremely popular solution to getting a “modern” shell experience is
oh-my-zsh. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I’ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past – it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what’s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it’s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.issue 2 with getting to a “modern” experience: the text editorIn the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were , , and .I think the main options for terminal text editors are:use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the workuse nano and accept that you’re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don’t think you can select text with the mouse and then “cut”
it in nano)use  or  which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editorjust avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode’s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use  as their  in the terminal.issue 3: individual applicationsThe last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine,  doesn’t support
the  keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:realize why this is happening (Mac OS won’t ship GNU tools, and “Ctrl-Left arrow” support comes from GNU readline)find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)adjust my environment (put Homebrew’s sqlite3 in my PATH)I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn’t feel “worth it” – often I’ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don’t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I’ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.A big part of having a “modern” experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can’t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in , but in   I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more “modern” command line tools isn’t easy (though
I made a list here),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you’re
SSHed into another machine, they won’t always be there.everything affects everything elseSomething I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything “nice”
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don’t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I’d need to think about a few things, like:if I wanted tmux’s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I’d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has OSC 52 supportif I wanted to use iTerm’s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I’d need to change how I configure colours – right now I set them
with a shell script that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.and probably more things I haven’t thought of. “Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours” sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided “well, I don’t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I’m not using that feature!”.It’s also hard to remember which features I’m relying on – for example maybe
my current terminal  have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don’t even realize that that’s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.Personally even though I think my setup is not  complicated, it’s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I’ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there’s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using  to eza a year or two ago and
while I like it (because  prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I’m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it’s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I’m
very happy I did.getting a “modern” terminal is not that easyTrying to explain how “easy” it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it’s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.I’ve found that there’s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Keychron Q0 Max macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPk09Ars-JE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-max-qmk-custom-number-pad

PowerSchool says its cloud-based student information system is used by 18,000 customers around the globe, including the US and Canada, to handle grading, attendance records, and personal information of more than 60 million K-12 students and teachers. On December 28 someone managed to get into its systems and access their contents "using a compromised credential," the California-based biz told its clients in an email seen by Register this week.
 
[...] "We believe the unauthorized actor extracted two tables within the student information system database," a spokesperson told us. "These tables primarily include contact information with data elements such as name and address information for families and educators. "For a certain subset of the customers, these tables may also include Social Security Number, other personally identifiable information, and limited medical and grade information. "Not all PowerSchool student information system customers were impacted, and we anticipate that only a subset of impacted customers will have notification obligations." While the company has tightened security measures and offered identity protection services to affected individuals, cybersecurity firm Cyble suggests the intrusion "may have been more serious and gone on much longer than has been publicly acknowledged so far," reports The Register. The cybersecurity vendor says the intrusion could have occurred as far back as June 16, 2011, with it ending on January 2 of this year.
 
"Critical systems and applications such as Oracle Netsuite ERP, HR software UltiPro, Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitLab, and sensitive credentials for platforms like Microsoft login, LogMeIn, Windows AD Azure, and BeyondTrust" may have been compromised, too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tom McLeish - Are Science &amp; Religion at War?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A3gjTyt3zw</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 20:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you listen: https://shorturl.at/mtJP4

Rita was born in Togo in 1991 and was raised by her grandparents. For a long time, she thought they were her parents. Hers was a happy childhood - but it ended abruptly.

At the age of nine, she‘s told that her biological mother lives in Munich and from now on, she must live with her.  Rita travels to Germany alone, where she receives a rather cold reception from her supposed mother. When Rita is abused by an acquaintance of her mother's, she’s too afraid to say anything.

With the help of her friends and a teacher, Rita finally moves into a child protection centre. Rita's suspicion that this woman is not her mother at all becomes more and more entrenched. A relative confesses to her that she is in fact her aunt and that her real mother lives in Togo. 

Rita bounces back from the shock and at the age of 17, she begins a course in restaurant management. Everything seems to be going well, but the traumas of her childhood soon catch up with her. After several unsuccessful suicide attempts, Rita realizes: to get answers to her questions, she needs to travel to Togo. There, she uncovers layer upon layer of lies.

Back in 2013 a couple random dudes decided to make a pseudo-sequel to Footprints in Stone called Forbidden History: Footprints in Stone II, which is essentially just an extended interview with Carl Baugh and his protegee Aaron Judkins. I was really tempted to call this video Footprints in Stone III, but restrained myself and consigned that in-joke to the clickbait title.

‘Sin’ is a term loaded with baggage. Different groups, mainly religious, use ‘sin’ to describe violations of the given order. Perpetrators of sin – ‘sinners’ – are punished in one form or another (in this life or the next). In the Christian tradition, where ‘sin’ plays a vital role, can we get an analytical description? What can we learn from the concept of sin?

Midway through my feed, I stumbled upon a video from a German TV show, where a 9-year-old girl demonstrated her ability to quickly identify the difference between two seemingly similar images.She repeated this with other images, always almost instantly calling out the differences. I was baffled. How is this possible?I turned my attention to the comments to see how Reddit reacted to this genius of a kid. The top comment immediately caught my attention:Wait, what? This can't be the case.I paused the video, trying to cross my eyes, but without luck. To give it another chance, I googled for "simple spot-the-difference puzzle" and tried again.For a moment, the images just seemed to blur over each other. But then suddenly, the images seemed to lock together in the middle, creating a third image between the two others that I was able to focus on.And the top Reddit comment was right. In the third image, some parts of the image stuck out. They looked a bit like they were shimmering or being lifted from the page. I was instantly able to call out the differences.I went back to the more difficult images from the video. Having trained to cross my eyes helped. It took me a second, but I was able to cross my eyes and get the third image to lock in. And again, I instantly spotted a shimmering detail in the image—the one small difference between the two images.In high anticipation, I demonstrated my newly found skill to my fiancée. She wasn’t as impressed as I thought she would be, but it still felt like I had just drunk a magic potion and gained a special superpower.Down below, you will find an easy, hard, and superhuman spot-the-difference puzzle.Practice on the easy one first, then work your way forward.Here is the step-by-step technique, that worked for me:Get a bit closer to the screen so you can see both images clearly.Now, cross your eyes and aim to overlap both images.When the images are overlapping, try to focus on the image in the middle.At one point, it should come into focus, and you can relax your eyes.Now look at the image, and the shimmering details should stand out to you. I’ve posted this on Hacker News and it sparked a thread of interesting comments and stories. Here a link to the post. 

Woah, I wouldn’t have expected so many readers! Funny to imagine how many people started crossing their eyes at their office or at home because of this small article. Some asked me how I build my website. It’s actually open-source, and you can find the Github repo here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cost vs Stability in a Cloud Environment • Cat Swetel • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhpPV6MYJek</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 13:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo

ABSTRACT
In a cloud environment, where horizontal and vertical scaling are relatively easy and frictionless, engineers are often forced to choose between cost and stability.

This talk posits that the cost versus stability trade-off is frequently imaginary. Stable systems are cost-effective systems. Join Cat to explore real-world examples of how focusing on stability can yield cost savings in a cloud environment. These real-world examples will also show how to frame engineering decisions in a way that accurately weighs cost and stability concerns, amongst others.

This talk is well suited for application engineers, performance engineers, architects, and finops professionals. Some experience with cloud environments is helpful but not necessarily needed. [...]

RFK, Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. 

The US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. 

Fluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains — and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.

DESCRIPTION
Julian Wood and Sam Newman delve into the complexities of software architecture, focusing on critical concepts such as microservices, asynchronous communication, and the importance of architectural decision-making.
Sam emphasizes the need for clear definitions in computing, particularly around terms like asynchronicity, advocating for an understanding of communication styles—event-driven versus request-response—as pivotal for effective system design. They discuss the value of architectural decision records (ADRs) as tools for fostering collaboration and documenting trade-offs in decision-making.

Additionally, the conversation highlights the evolving role of AI in software development, stressing that while AI can assist in understanding and maintaining existing codebases, the human element of critical thinking remains essential in navigating the complexities of modern software systems.

Though there are more fixed and mobile telephone connections, even they use Internet technology in their core. For all the many uses the Internet allows for today, its origins lie in the cold war and the need for a defense communications network that could survive a nuclear strike. But that defense communications network quickly became used for general communications and within only a few years of the first transmission, traffic on the predecessor to today’s Internet was already 75 percent email.Arpanet was the vital precursor of today’s Internet, commissioned by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1969. In his interesting account of why Arpanet came about, Stephen Lukasic, director of DARPA from 1970–75, wrote that if its true nature and impact had been realized it would never have been permitted under the US government structure of the time. The concept for a decentralized communications technology that would survive a nuclear attack would have placed it outside DARPA’s remit (as defense communications specifically were assigned to a different agency), so the focus changed to how to connect computers together so that major applications could be run on the most appropriate system available.This was in the era of time-sharing computers. Today’s familiar world of the ubiquitous “personal computer” on each desk was decades away. Computers of this time were generally very large, filling entire rooms, and comparatively rare. Users working at connected terminals would submit jobs to the computer that would allocate processing time for the job when available. The idea went that if these computers were networked together, an available remote computer could process a job even when the computers closer to the users were full. The resulting network was called Arpanet, and the first packets of data traversed the network in September 1969.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Islam Influenced Black Americans in 1920s Chicago | American Muslims: A History Revealed</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN8bg2UiiVg</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2025 17:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 1920s saw a revival in Islam among Black Americans fleeing poverty and persecution in the Jim Crow South. In Northern cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, they found strength and security in a range of Muslim organizations, from the India-based Ahmadiyya movement to the homegrown Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam. In this film, host Malika Bilal (Senior Presenter, Al Jazeera English) tells the story of these early Black American Muslim communities through a woman named Florence Watts, who moved to the bustling South Side of Chicago around 1910, where she found work as a cook and a maid. 

Drawing on the work of Sylvia Chan-Malik, (author of Being Muslim: A Cultural History of Women of Color in American Islam,) Malika discovers how Florence was drawn to the teachings of the Ahmadiyya missionary, Mufti Mohammad Sadiq. In 1923, she joined one of the first multi-racial Muslim communities in the country. That same year, Florence was featured in the Ahmadiyya magazine Moslem Sunrise, her image captured in one of the earliest known photographs of a group of Muslim women taken in the United States. Through Florence’s story, Malika discovers how these Muslim groups helped working-class Black Americans resist the confines of race in the United States and feel part of a global community of believers. They in turn helped to create a legacy of Islam that has been embraced by African Americans since.

American Muslims: A History Revealed
A series of six short documentary films that reveal and explore the early history of Muslims in America. The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric. Actors reading the part of historical characters include Hiam Abbas, David Rasche, Kamal Khan, and Faarshad Farahat.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The intestine - The body’s underappreciated control center and gut health | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zbqo_hrwXc</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2025 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The intestine is a true marvel. This organ’s complex functions extend far beyond the mere processing of food. The intestine affects the immune system and also has a powerful effect on our emotional well-being.

If a person’s gut is doing well, that person is doing well. If the gut is doing poorly, however, it can lead to chronic inflammation -- or depression. So, what can be done to protect and strengthen the gut?

This documentary follows people for whom the gut plays a special role in their lives. They speak openly about what is sometimes a taboo subject.

Jana Eberhart has a stressful everyday life. The student works as a model and is a passionate about sports. In fact, she’s about to take part in an Ironman competition. Can a change in diet strengthen her gut so that she can perform better? Sports and nutrition consultant Dr. Jens Freese accompanies Jana on her project over an extended period of time. What impact will dietary changes and other interventions have? 

For actor and fitness influencer Philipp Stehler, careful management of the gut is essential. He lives with ulcerative colitis, a chronic intestinal inflammation condition. This disease almost cost him his life. His large intestine had to be surgically removed. Philipp Stehler talks openly about his life then and now. While his diet used to consist mainly of meat and protein shakes, he now eats a vegan diet and practices yoga and meditation every day.

Carina Speck has been living with irritable bowel syndrome or IBS for 13 years. Bloating, diarrhea and stomach cramps accompany her in everything she does. But the social media manager doesn't want to isolate herself because of it. On Instagram and TikTok, she gives tips on things like traveling with IBS. Dr. Miriam Stengel from SRH Klinikum Sigmaringen guides her, with recommendations on how she can get a better handle on her symptoms.

--

No substance has been as constant an ally to insidious scheming as arsenic, the so-called “king of poisons.” In its chemically pure form, it isn’t much of a threat because our bodies don’t absorb it well; it’s when arsenic combines with other elements that things get dangerous. So, how did this substance become such a popular poison? Neil Bradbury digs into the element's sordid and lethal history.

Overall, I was satisfied with it, despite some strange recent updates like adding AI features, KeyChain integration, and security vulnerabilities.In recent years, new terminal emulators have appeared. I tried using them mainly for testing macmon. A couple of years ago, I tried switching to kitty, which was faster due to GPU acceleration. However, it required too much customization and still looked very non-native for macOS. GPU acceleration was added to iTerm as well, so I stayed with it.I also tried Alacritty, but it is very basic and lacks the features I need. Recently, I tested Ghostty, which has gained huge attention – it has nice defaults, but its RAM usage is concerning (around 250MB per empty tab). Currently, it also lacks buffer search, which makes the terminal useless for me.I heard a lot of positive feedback about WezTerm from bobuk. So I decided to try it out and use it for some time – and I am very satisfied with it.The next part of the article will be about how to make WezTerm understandable for iTerm users to try it or switch completely.WezTerm can be installed from Homebrew:When you first open WezTerm, it looks plain, non-native, and not very functional. But actually, it has everything you need. This is because WezTerm is cross-platform, unlike iTerm2, so the author left minimal default settings, leaving the rest of the configuration to the user. My goal is to achieve a similar experience in WezTerm as I had in iTerm.WezTerm does not have a graphical interface for configuration, and the setup is done through a Lua file (this is unusual for me, but Vim users are familiar with it). The configuration file can be located at  or ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua. I prefer the second path because it is where Fish and starship store configs too.Create a configuration file:And then add the boilerplate code for configuration:First, I want to change the default font, its size, and disable ligatures (because it's important to see the actual characters in case of some logs).Save the file, and the changes should be applied immediately (yes, no reload required!).Next, I want to change the theme and set it to follow the current system theme automatically. For the past year, I have been using Catppuccin themes, and I am very happy with them. They rarely have issues where some text colors blend with the background. To make the theme switch automatically based on the current system theme, we need to write a small Lua function (I copied it from the documentation):I forgot to mention that the Catppuccin theme, like many other popular themes, is pre-installed in WezTerm, so you don't need to install it separately like in iTerm, which is very cool. Of course, you can also set up your own colors.The default padding also seems a bit large, so let's make it smaller. I also had a Blinking Line Cursor (I don't remember if this is the default or not in iTerm). Let's set both configurations:In iTerm, I used the Minimal theme to save vertical space for tabs. We can do the same in WezTerm (the default tabs don't look very good). Also possible to add some transparency and blur to the window. I didn't use this in iTerm, but let's try it now:In iTerm, I usually set large values for Cols/Rows to make the start window bigger. This approach is a bit outdated, so let's make the window open in full screen when the terminal starts.Finally, the most important part is setting up hotkeys – it's hard to give up what you've been used to for years. An important thing for me is Split Panels with  / .  should close the current active panel, not the whole tab.  – clear the current screen.  /  for start/end of the line. I think these are all defaults from iTerm, so let's make them the same in WezTerm:WezTerm also has a Command Execution menu. I haven't used it much yet, but just in case, I bind it to the same keys as in VSCode / Zed – .Note: In the configuration, the  value is case-sensitive, so  and  are different things (basically  is the same as ). I initially got confused with this.Overall, I am very satisfied with WezTerm and have fully switched to using it daily. One cool feature I want to mention is the quick connect to servers in Known hosts via SSH (Command Palette → type server name → Enter OR Nav Bar → Shell → Click on server name). WezTerm also has Workspaces – an alternative to tmux, but I haven't used it actively yet.Here a gist with the final config from this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here’s how hucksters are manipulating Google to promote shady Chrome extensions</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/googles-chrome-web-store-has-a-serious-spam-problem-promoting-shady-extensions/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 23:46:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The people overseeing the security of Google’s Chrome browser explicitly forbid third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the Chrome Web Store. The policy specifically calls out search-manipulating techniques such as listing multiple extensions that provide the same experience or plastering extension descriptions with loosely related or unrelated keywords.On Wednesday, security and privacy researcher Wladimir Palant revealed that developers are flagrantly violating those terms in hundreds of extensions currently available for download from Google. As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.Not looking? Don’t care? Both?A search Wednesday morning in California for Norton Password Manager, for example, returned not only the official extension but three others, all of which are unrelated at best and potentially abusive at worst. The results may look different for searches at other times or from different locations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I had to take down my course-swapping site or be expelled</title><link>https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jdkaim_github-jdkaimhuskyswap-huskyswap-project-activity-7282609173316415488-1jdb</link><author>jdkaim</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 21:27:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Choices software professionals make today have become exponentially more complicated. Every day, some programmer somewhere is wondering: Which framework to learn?, what tech stack to use?, monolith or multi-tier or microservices architecture?, on-premise or cloud?, if cloud then AWS or GCP or Azure or something else?, and even more choices on databases, programming languages, operating systems, different versions, etc. The most complicated award probably goes to choosing the right JavaScript framework, that is if you even can keep up with new releases!!! 😱

After 25 years in the industry, here are my two cents:

1. Conquer the basics when you're learning. Low level language, data structures, algorithms, design patterns, and web fundamentals (HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript before any framework). Also form a habit to complete learning one before going to the next.

2. After that, keep it simple and go with the flow based on the problem you're solving. Understanding the problem you're solving, thinking about it, designing the solution, running it by a few others before even starting to code would take you further than most others.

3. Develop other things along the way that are equally material, vital and rewarding than being just a good programmer. These include: presentation skills; positive, moving-forward attitude; knowledge-sharing, and continuous learning mindset.

4. Most important of all: Have fun! Despite all the chaos, I still find it to be a lot of fun.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who guessed Chuck&apos;s fav Star Trek character correctly BEFORE he answered? 🖖</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxHYx8uqTiE</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 21:14:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

What sets ancient Rome apart is that many of these celebrities—particularly gladiators, actors, and musicians—were slaves, performing in public arenas to gain fame, sometimes even achieving wealth and freedom.

Explore how Roman emperors, such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, shaped not only the political landscape but also fashion trends and cultural movements. Hadrian, for instance, popularized wearing a beard, which became fashionable for a century after his reign. Roman gladiators, actresses, musicians, and authors, rose to prominence through their performances. Despite being from marginalized backgrounds, their talents made them stars, adored by the public.

For years, the auto industry has been hyping the transition to electric vehicles with optimistic sales forecasts for electric models and huge growth projections. Investors pumped up valuations for automakers, based on their visions for an electric future.

Now the hype is dwindling, and companies are again cheering consumer choice. Automakers from Ford Motor and General Motors to Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo are scaling back or delaying their electric vehicle plans.

Tesla’s annual vehicle deliveries declined for the first time in more than a decade during a period when overall car sales are up. Have automakers overinvested in EVs and are EVs killing the car industry?

She was every bit a woman of her time, engaging in the overblown sentimentality and culture of death so pervasive during the age that bears her name. When she died at 81, the queen left secret, detailed instructions on how to handle her body and what items to place in her coffin. There are, indeed, a number of strange Queen Victoria death facts worth exploring.

But this did not apply to the armed services until January 2000 – prior to that being queer in the British military was not only illegal but would have resulted in a possible jail term and instant dismissal. Lee Arnott has studied the gay experience within the military between 1969 and the present day. In this video, we look at why it took so long for the British military to lift the ban.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, there was a sports journalist named Maria.She had to travel often by flight for work.But one day she lost her luggage during a flight, and couldn’t track it. So she was sad and upset.She hears about a tracking device, called Apple AirTag, from a coworker.And bought it immediately, she was dazzled by its simplicity in tracking luggage.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re also on Bluesky:An AirTag contains a low-power CPU and a tiny amount of memory.A tracking device must send its accurate location data at regular intervals.Yet finding location data using GPS, WiFI, or cellular networks consumes power. Besides it’s expensive to maintain a tracking device with GPS functionality.So smart engineers at Apple used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.An AirTag doesn’t use GPS, WiFi, or a cellular network for communication; instead, it uses Bluetooth Low Energy ().Imagine BLE as a low-power wireless technology for communication.The key pair is shared between AirTag and the user account. The AirTag sends location data after encrypting it using the public key. While the user account decrypts the received location data using the private key.Think of the  as an email address; anyone can send messages to it. While the  is similar to the password of an inbox; only the user with the password can read emails.And authenticity of an email can be verified by checking the sender’s email address: .2. Broadcasting AirTag’s LocationThey send the AirTag’s location, which is near its owner’s iPhone, using Bluetooth, or Ultra Wideband for precision and efficiency.Think of  as a wireless technology for high-speed, and short-range communication.Yet Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband communication won’t work if the owner’s iPhone is far from the AirTag. So they rely on someone else's iPhone which is nearby.The AirTag broadcasts its public key every 2 seconds over BLE.Someone else’s iPhone, which is nearby, receives the broadcast signal. The iPhone encrypts its location data and timestamp using the received public key.The iPhone uploads the encrypted data to the Apple server over HTTP.Put simply, AirTag doesn’t send location data; instead, only the public key. The iPhone then includes its location data and encrypts it.3. Finding AirTag’s LocationThe owner can find AirTag’s location using their iPhone app.The owner authenticates on the Apple server.The owner requests location data for a specific public key.The owner decrypts the received location data using their private key.The iPhone then displays AirTag’s recent location on a map.An iPhone is necessary to relay location data, so an AirTag won’t work if there aren’t any iPhones nearby.Put simply, the precision and effectiveness of an AirTag depends on the number of iPhones in its proximity.While there are around 1.46 billion iPhone users in the world.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in February 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

Analysis of the coffee consumption of more than 40,000 adults found that morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease during a 10-year follow-up period than those who went without. But the benefits to heart health appeared to vanish in people who drank coffee throughout the day, the researchers found, with medical records showing no significant reduction in mortality for all-day drinkers compared with those who avoided coffee. [...]
 
The study suggests that a morning dose of coffee is better for the heart than an evening one, but it does not explain why. One possible explanation is that drinking coffee later in the day can disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin. This in turn affects sleep, inflammation and blood pressure, all of which can harm heart health. In an accompanying editorial, Prof Thomas Luscher, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals in London, notes that many all-day drinkers sleep poorly, adding that coffee seems to suppress melatonin, a hormone that is important for inducing sleep in the brain. The effects are driven largely by caffeine, but coffee contains hundreds of other bioactive compounds that affect our physiology. The researchers say some substances in the blood that drive inflammation often peak in the morning and could be countered by anti-inflammatory compounds in a morning coffee. "This explanation applies to both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee," they write. "Overall, we must accept the now substantial evidence that coffee drinking, particularly in the morning hours, is likely to be healthy," Luscher writes. "Thus, drink your coffee, but do so in the morning!"
 
The study has been published in the European Heart Journal.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cracking a 512-bit DKIM key for less than $8 in the cloud</title><link>https://dmarcchecker.app/articles/crack-512-bit-dkim-rsa-key</link><author>awulf</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 12:32:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Driven by curiosity, we decided to explore whether we could crack one of these keys. Our goal was to extract the private key from a public RSA key, enabling us to sign emails as if we were the original sender. We were also curious to see whether emails signed with this compromised key would pass the DKIM verification checks of major email providers like Gmail, Outlook.com, and Yahoo Mail, or if they would outright refuse to verify a signature generated with such a short key.For our experiment, we chose redfin.com after discovering a 512-bit RSA public key at key1._domainkey.redfin.com (now no longer available):$ dig +short TXT key1._domainkey.redfin.com
"k=rsa; p=MFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSwAwSAJBAMx7VnoRmk/wFPeFWxrVUde6AJQI51/uPFL2CbiHGMnRSnLjPs72AgxAVHIe5QrNQ2riR5+7u47Sgh5R5va/d0cCAwEAAQ=="Decoding the RSA Public KeyThe public key, located in the DKIM record’s  tag, is encoded in ASN.1 DER format, and further encoded as Base64. To decode the key to obtain the modulus () and the public exponent (), we used a couple of lines of Python code:$ python3
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> RSA.import_key('-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n' + 'MFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSwAwSAJBAMx7VnoRmk/wFPeFWxrVUde6AJQI51/uPFL2CbiHGMnRSnLjPs72AgxAVHIe5QrNQ2riR5+7u47Sgh5R5va/d0cCAwEAAQ==' + '\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----')

This process, known as factoring, can be quite challenging to perform efficiently. Fortunately, we found a powerful open-source tool called CADO-NFS, which offers an easy-to-use implementation of the Number Field Sieve (NFS) algorithm — the most efficient method available for factoring large integers.Since factoring takes a lot of computing power and we didn’t want to tie up our computers for days, we went with renting a cloud server. We chose a server with 8 dedicated vCPUs (AMD EPYC 7003 series) and 32 GB of RAM from Hetzner, installing Ubuntu as the OS. Setting up CADO-NFS was straightforward:git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/cado-nfs/cado-nfs.git
cd cado-nfs
makeTo ensure the server had enough memory for the task, we added 32 GB of swap space:sudo fallocate -l 32G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfileWe started the factorization by calling the  script with  as the input:./cado-nfs.py 10709580243955269690347257968368575486652256021267387585731784527165077094358215924099792804326677548390607229176966588251215467367272433485332943072098119The process took approximately 86 hours on our 8-vCPU server, successfully factorizing  into  and :Info:Complete Factorization / Discrete logarithm: Total cpu/elapsed time for entire Complete Factorization 2.20529e+06/309865 [3d 14:04:25]

The process involved using Python and the PyCryptodome library:$ python3
>>> from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
>>> from Crypto.Util.number import inverse
>>> p = 97850895333751392558280999318309697780438485965134147739065017624372104720767

>>> e = 65537
>>> n = p * q

>>> d = inverse(e, phi)

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----Sending DKIM-Signed Test Mails From @redfin.comWith the RSA private key integrated into our OpenDKIM setup, we proceeded to the testing phase. We crafted a simple email with a FROM address of security@redfin.com, then sent it to a variety of email hosting services. Although most providers correctly identified the 512-bit key as insecure and rejected our DKIM signature, three major providers — Yahoo Mail, Mailfence, and Tuta — reported a  result.Here’s how each provider responded:Given that redfin.com also has a valid DMARC record (v=DMARC1;p=reject;pct=100;rua=mailto:a+99923342@fdmarc.net;ruf=mailto:f+99923342@fdmarc.net;ri=3600;fo=1;), passing the DKIM check for  also means that our email passed DMARC verification and met the requirements for BIMI.Three decades ago, breaking a 512-bit RSA public key was a feat achievable only with a supercomputer. Today, it’s possible to do so in just a few hours for less than US$8 on a cloud server. And if you have a powerful computer at home with 16 or more cores, you could accomplish this even more swiftly and cost-effectively.There’s no good reason to use 512 or 768-bit keys these days.

Nowdays, companies like Auth0 use it to refer to the slightly-magical feat of including a login link in an email.Last week, the great website you should subscribe to if you haven’t already (it’s great, when you’re not logged out), 404 Media, posted “We Don’t Want Your Password” in defense of so-called magic links.Of course, as stated in the article, such email links are harder to phish than passwords, can’t lead to a breach of passwords, and protect the site itself against users who might reuse passwords previously compromised.The article even covers some of my annoyances with this system, but throws out this sentence:Easier than what? Easier than a long password, without a password manager? Easier than a passkey? Easier than an OTP sent to the same email address?This sentence reads to me as one written by someone mostly working and  from a single laptop and mobile device. The second part of the sentence, calling for more sites to do this is why I am writing this.For any scenario with a minimal amount of complexity, like users with multiple computers, and you’re looking at a scenario where the site’s unwillingness to deal with other login methods shoves friction on the end-user.Multiple devices. Who doesn’t use at least a few computers weekly? I don’t have my email on my gaming PC, nor do I have it on my work laptops.Slower. From 2 seconds slower to minutes slower, depending on SMTP delays as well as how awkward it is to get the link to the right browser.Anti-mobile. As mentioned by 404 in their own article, this breaks the ability to use in-app browsers, which is quite annoying especially for RSS reader type apps. It makes interacting with any local link in the RSS feed extremely annoying.Indirect security downsides. Pushing people to access personal email on work devices (or vice-versa) isn’t exactly a win for security.Another annoying  system is to email or SMS an OTP the end user can type in.While this sucks, it at least allows you to easily log in in situations where you don’t have a clear and easy copy/paste path from the email client to the browser you want to log in to.Stratechery, powered by Passport, uses this type of scheme (click link OR type in OTP), which is still shifting annoyances onto end-users to free developers from implementing passkeys, but at least has a bit more of an appreciation for end-users.If you insist on using magic/tragic links by default, at least consider offering a robust alternative, such as passkeys, especially if your audience is technical and privacy-focused.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mistakes engineers make in large established codebases</title><link>https://www.seangoedecke.com/large-established-codebases/</link><author>BerislavLopac</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 7 Jan 2025 20:44:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Working in large established codebases is one of the hardest things to learn as a software engineer. You can’t practice it beforehand (no, open source does not give you the same experience). Personal projects can never teach you how to do it, because they’re necessarily small and from-scratch. For the record, when I say “large established codebases”, I mean:Single-digit million lines of code (~5M, let’s say)Somewhere between 100 and 1000 engineers working on the same codebaseThe first working version of the codebase is at least ten years oldI’ve now spent a decade working in these codebases. Here’s what I wish I’d known at the start.The cardinal mistake is inconsistencyThere’s one mistake I see more often than anything else, and it’s absolutely deadly: ignoring the rest of the codebase and just implementing your feature in the most sensible way. In other words, limiting your touch points with the existing codebase in order to keep your nice clean code uncontaminated by legacy junk. For engineers that have mainly worked on small codebases, this is very hard to resist. But you must resist it! In fact, you must sink as deeply into the legacy codebase as possible, in order to maintain consistency.Why is consistency so important in large codebases? Because it protects you from nasty surprises, it slows down the codebase’s progression into a mess, and it allows you to take advantage of future improvements.Suppose you’re building an API endpoint for a particular type of user. You could put some “return 403 if current user isn’t of that type” logic in your endpoint. But you should first go and look to see what other API endpoints in the codebase do for auth. If they use some specific set of helpers, you should also use that helper (even if it’s ugly, hard to integrate with, or seems like overkill for your use case). You must resist the urge to make your little corner of the codebase nicer than the rest of it.The main reason to do this is because large codebases have a lot of landmines in them. For instance, you might not know that the codebase has a concept of “bots”, which are like users but not quite, and require special treatment for auth. You might not know that the internal support tooling in the codebase allows an engineer to sometimes authenticate on behalf of a user, which requires special treatment for auth. There’s definitely another hundred things you might not know. Existing functionality represents a safe path through the minefield. If you do your auth like other API endpoints that have stuck around for a long time, you can follow that path without having to know all the surprising things that the codebase does.On top of that, lack of consistency is the primary long-term killer of large codebases, because it makes it impossible to make any general improvements. Sticking with our auth example, if you want to ever introduce a new type of user, a consistent codebase lets you update the existing set of auth helpers to accommodate that. In an inconsistent codebase, where some API endpoints are doing things differently, you’ll have to go and update and test every one of those implementations. In practice, that means that the general change does not happen, or that the hardest 5% of endpoints to update are just left out of scope - which in turn decreases consistency further, because now you have a user type that works for most-but-not-all API endpoints.So when you sit down to implement anything in a large codebase, you should always first go and look around for prior art, and follow that if at all possible.Is anything else important?Consistency is the most important thing. Let me quickly run through some other concerns as well, though:You need to develop a good sense of how the service is used in practice (i.e. by users). Which endpoints are hit the most often? Which endpoints are the most crucial (i.e. are used by paying customers and cannot gracefully degrade)? What latency guarantees must the service obey, and what code gets run in the hot paths? One common large-codebase mistake is to make a “tiny tweak” that is unexpectedly in the hot path for a crucial flow, and thus causes a big problem.You can’t rely on your ability to test the code in development like you can in a small project. Any large project accumulates state over time (for instance, how many kinds of user do you think GMail supports?) At a certain point, you can’t test every combination of states, even with automation. Instead, you have to test the crucial paths, code defensively, and rely on slow rollouts and monitoring to catch problems.Be very, very reluctant to introduce new dependencies. In large codebases, code often lives forever. Dependencies introduce an ongoing cost in security vulnerabilities and package updates that will almost certainly outlive your tenure at the company. If you have to, make sure you pick dependencies that are widely-used and reliable, or that are easy to fork if needed. For related reasons, if you ever get the chance to remove code, take it with both hands. This is some of the riskiest work in large codebases, so don’t half-ass it: first instrument the code to identify callers in production and drive them down to zero, so you can be absolutely certain it’s safe to remove. But it’s still worth doing. There are few things in a large codebase more worthwhile than safely removing code.Work in small PRs and front-load the changes that affect other teams’ code. This one is important in small projects too, but it’s critical in large ones. That’s because you’ll often be relying on the domain experts in other teams to anticipate things you’ve missed (since large projects are just too complex to anticipate it all yourself). If you keep your changes to risky areas small and easy-to-read, those domain experts have a much better chance of noticing problems and saving you from an incident.Finally, I want to take a second to defend these codebases in general. One common take I’ve heard goes like this:Why would you ever decide to work in the legacy mess? Spending time knee-deep in spaghetti code might be hard, but it isn’t good engineering. When faced with a large established codebase, our job should be to shrink it by splitting out small elegant services instead of wading in and making the mess larger.I think this is totally wrong-headed. The main reason is that, as a general rule, large established codebases produce 90% of the value. In any big tech company, the majority of the revenue-producing activity (i.e. the work that actually pays your engineering salary) comes from a large established codebase. If you work at a big tech company and don’t think this is true, maybe you’re right, but I’ll only take that opinion seriously if you’re deeply familiar with the large established codebase you think isn’t providing value. I’ve seen multiple cases where a small elegant service powers some core feature of a high-revenue product, but all the actual productizing code (settings, user management, billing, enterprise reporting, etc) still lives in the large established codebase.So you should know how to work in the “legacy mess” because that’s what your company actually does. Good engineering or not, . The other reason is that you cannot split up a large established codebase without first understanding it. I have seen large codebases successfully split up, but I have never seen that done by a team that wasn’t already fluent at shipping features inside the large codebase. You simply cannot redesign any non-trivial project (i.e. a project that makes real money) from first-principles. There are too many accidental details that support tens of millions of dollars of revenue.Large codebases are worth working in because they usually pay your salaryBy far the most important thing is consistencyNever start a feature without first researching prior art in the codebaseIf you don’t follow existing patterns, you better have a very good reason for itUnderstand the production footprint of the codebaseDon’t expect to be able to test every case - instead, rely on monitoringRemove code any chance you get, but be very careful about itMake it as easy as possible for domain experts to catch your mistakes this post was discussed on Hacker News, if you’d like to read comments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2252 - Wesley Huff</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwyAX69xG1Q</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Tue, 7 Jan 2025 18:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://www.expressvpn.com/ROGAN and find out how you can get 4 months of ExpressVPN free!

Our family made eight $1 million donations to nonprofit groups working to support those most currently in need:Team Rubicon – Mobilizing veterans to continue their service, leveraging their skills and experience to help Americans prepare, respond, and recover from natural disasters.Children's Hunger Fund – Provides resources to local churches in the United States and around the world to meet the needs of impoverished community members.PEN America – Defends writers against censorship and abuse, supports writers in need of emergency assistance, and amplifies the writing of incarcerated prisoners. (One of my personal favorites; I've seen the power of writing transform our world many times.)The Trevor Project – Working to change hearts, minds, and laws to support the lives of young adults seeking acceptance as fellow Americans.First Generation Investors –Introduces high school students in low-income areas to the fundamentals of investing, providing them real money to invest, encouraging long-term wealth accumulation and financial literacy among underserved youth.Global Refuge – Supporting migrants and refugees from around the globe, in partnership with community-based legal and social service providers nationwide, helping rebuild lives in America.Planned Parenthood – Provides essential healthcare services and resources that help individuals and families lead healthier lives.I encourage every American to contribute soon, however you can, to organizations you feel are those most currently in need here in America.We must alsowork toward deeper changes that will take decades to achieve. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth towards long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to the American Dream. I never thought my family would be able to do this. My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson.During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the federal minimum wage, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with lower in-state tuition, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. College tuition at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These huge cost increases for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen in 2008 when we built Stack Overflow, a Q&A website for programmers creating a shared Creative Commons knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that's the American way. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using ranked choice voting. We built a  – of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. It worked. With the guidance of my co-founder Joel Spolsky, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for Discourse, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to set boundaries the community agrees on, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. Digital democracy , for everyone.In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.I've always felt Stack Overflow and Discourse are projects for the public good that happen to be corporations. I probably couldn't have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck. That's what the American Dream promises us. I recently attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son's public high school. All I really knew was the famous "stay gold" line from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant:  the American Dream. In the printed program, the director wrote:This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity. Whether you've read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.Stay gold.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix captured this distortion so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, enough of us voted for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don't understand.I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively keeping America fair for everyone. Our status as the world's leading democracy is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as  so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because . We don't have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.Even with the wealth I have, I can't imagine what it would feel like to be a billionaireIt is, for lack of a better word, In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country's wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined.I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things that :Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile booksMore than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete. When would this wealth be transferred? November 5th raised the stakes. It is now time to allocate  I was so fortunate to be dealt within the next five years not just for my own family, but for all my fellow Americans. Our government seems to be slower and slower at delivering change due to the increased polarization of our two party system. The last meaningful constitutional amendment we've managed to pass in the last 60 years was the 26th amendment in 1971, lowering the voting age to 18 and giving more people a voice in our democracy. I've always loved the ideals behind the American Dream, though we continually struggle to live up to them. They are worth fighting for, even if it means making "good trouble". We must come together and believe in our shared American Dream so deeply that we can improve our democracy... but which dream?The American Dream contains the path of hate, and the path of love. Throughout our history, one hand is always fighting the other. Which path are we choosing?Our family pledges half our remaining wealth toward an American Dream founded on love.Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.We could found a new organization loosely based on the original RAND Corporation, but modernized like Lever for Change. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for  working within the current system or outside it.We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.We've already completed the eight $1 million donations listed above to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together. I will gladly advise and working towards the same goal.Please join us in Sharing the American Dream:Support organizations you feel are effectively helping those most in need across America right now.Within the next five years, also contribute public dedications of time or funds towards longer term efforts to keep the American Dream fair and attainable for all our children.(I could not have done this without the support of my partner Betsy Burton and the rest of my family. I'd also like to thank Steve McConnell, whose writing inspired me to start this blog in 2004. So many people from all walks of life generously shared their feedback to improve this post. We wrote it together. Thank you all.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>10 big predictions for 2025 (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/126</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[M.G.

He added, "We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies."Both statements are notable coming from Altman, who has served as the leader of OpenAI during the rise of mainstream generative AI products such as ChatGPT.

He makes the case for Northeastern to reconsider its decision to move from Racket to Python and Java later this year in an overhaul of its first-year curriculum. 

"Students will get extensive training in Python, which is currently the most requested language by co-op employers," Northeastern explains (some two decades after a Slashdot commenter made the same Hot Languages = Jobs observation in a spirited 2001 debate on Java as a CS introductory language)... 

"I have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a 'useful language' like Python," Kaplan writes. "But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket — it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends." Also expressing concerns about the selection of suitable languages for novice programming is King's College CS Prof Michael Kölling, who explains, "One of the drivers is the perceived usefulness of the language in a real-world context. Students (and their parents) often have opinions which language is 'better' to learn. In forming these opinions, the definition of 'better' can often be vague and driven by limited insight. One strong aspect commonly cited is the perceived usefulness of a language in the 'real world.' If a language is widely used in industry, it is more likely to be seen as a useful language to learn." Kölling's recommendation? "We need a new language for teaching novices at secondary school and introductory university level," Kölling concludes. "This language should be designed explicitly for teaching [...] Maintenance and adaptation of this language should be driven by pedagogical considerations, not by industry needs." While noble in intent, one suspects Kaplan and Kölling may be on a quixotic quest in a money wins world, outgunned by the demands, resources, and influence of tech giants like Amazon — the top employer of Northeastern MSCS program grads — who pushed back against NSF advice to deemphasize Java in high school CS and dropped $15 million to have tech-backed nonprofit Code.org develop and push a new Java-based, powered-by-AWS CS curriculum into high schools with the support of a consortium of politicians, educators, and tech companies. Echoing Northeastern, an Amazon press release argued the new Java-based curriculum "best prepares students for the next step in their education and careers."

 In November the Steam Survey reflected a 2.03% marketshare for Linux... Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. 

 In fact, December "saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey," according to TechSpot — "up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%..."
Elsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.
Rounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... 

Phoronix adds that the Windows percent "pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>All Of The Ways The Ocean Can Kill You</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcycbWnNlU</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 5 Jan 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ocean.

Soundwaves: The Symphony of Physics 
Sound is one of the most vivid ways we interact with the underlying science of the universe. A sound can make us laugh, cry or cower in fear, but it can also help us understand our world, how it works and what it's made of. Sound is something we all take for granted, but, in fact, when you hear something you're listening to the sound of pure physics. In this engrossing two-part series Helen Czerski goes on a spectacular journey into the world of sound to discover what it is and what it reveals about the fundamental forces of nature.

With over 3,000 problems, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lost.Which problems should you solve? How many problems are enough for coding interviews?How much time should you spend on each problem?I will answer these questions and more in this article to make your journey smoother, and lot less less painful.For context - I’ve solved more than 1,500 LeetCode problems and cleared interviews at multiple big tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and in this article I’ll share everything I’ve learned to help you start and navigate LeetCode more effectively.I’ll share practical tips and resources to help you save time, stay focused and build your problem-solving skills without feeling overwhelmed.Why do you even need LeetCode?You might be wondering: why is everyone doing LeetCode questions. Is it really necessary to land a Software Engineering job?The short answer is: .There are plenty of startups and smaller companies that focus more on your experience with specific tech stacks and the projects you’ve built. They might not even include LeetCode style questions in their interview process.But if your goal is to work at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, you would need to practice LeetCode style questions since that’s what they ask in their interviews.Which programming language to choose?This is a question I get asked all the time.Many people get stuck at deciding which programming language to use.But here’s the truth: It doesn’t really matter. A programming language is just a tool. Once you understand the approach to solving a problem, you can implement it in any language.In my experience giving interviews, unless the job specifically requires expertise in a certain language, you’ll be fine using any language you’re comfortable with.The point is, LeetCode isn’t about syntax. It’s about using the right data structures, algorithms, and your ability to think critically and solve problems.That said, if you’re new to coding, I recommend starting with  It’s beginner-friendly and has a simpler syntax.If you already know a language—stick with it. Whether it’s C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go, there’s no need to switch.You don’t need to be an expert in your chosen language, but you should know the basics like:and input/output operationsBeyond the basics, spend some time learning the  for common data structures and algorithms.These libraries save time and let you focus on solving the problem rather than reimplementing data structures from scratch.Python has lists, dictionaries, and sets.Java has ArrayList, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.C++ offers the STL library with vector, map, and set.Before diving into LeetCode problems, it’s good to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.Basic Data Structures like Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.and Fundamental Algorithms like Sorting techniques, binary search, and recursion.Recursion is particularly important, since many problems specially tree and graph related ones rely heavily on it.When you’re familiar with these topics, it becomes much easier to recognize which concept applies to a specific problem.You don’t need to dive too deeply into every topic upfront. Most of your understanding will develop naturally as you solve problems.There are plenty of resources available online to help you get started. Don’t waste time searching for the “perfect” resource—pick one and start learning.The focus should always be on progress, not perfection.Here are some resources I personally found quite useful: It’s my second channel where I upload animated tutorials on DSA and LeetCode patterns.Here’s a comprehensive list of DSA topics you should know for coding interviews:Learn one topic at a timeIf you’re a beginner, focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.For example: Start with , the move to , then progress to more complex topics like , , and .This approach helps you develop a deeper understanding of each topic and teaches you how to recognize when to use a particular data structure or algorithm.Once you’ve learned the basics of a topic and understand how to implement it from scratch, it’s time to put your knowledge to the test.Solve 4-5 easy problems related to that topic on LeetCode.and Build confidence in applying the concepts.If you want to learn more about how to master a DSA topic, you can check out this article where I discuss it in more detail:Which problems should you solve?If you open LeetCode, there are over That number alone can feel overwhelming. So, how do you decide which ones to solve?Start with  for each topic. These are perfect for building confidence and understanding the basics of problem-solving.Once you’re comfortable with the easy ones, gradually challenge yourself with slightly harder problems that push you beyond your comfort zone.Remember, real growth happens when you constantly Don’t worry about hard problems in the beginning.Most coding interviews focus on , so that’s where you should spend the majority of your time.These lists are excellent, and I highly recommend solving every problem on them.How many problems should you solve?There’s no magic number, but from my experience,  is the sweet spot.However, it’s not about solving just any 300 problems. Focus on  that cover the most topics and patterns.To make it easier for you, I’ve created a : a curated list of the Top 300 LeetCode Problems organized into that are most commonly asked in coding interviews.You can find it on  Just head to the practice page. You will see a structured list  that you can follow from top to bottom.Resources to help you learn the topics.Ability to track your progress and mark problems for future revision.Links to GitHub and YouTube solutions.and ability to filter problems based on pattern, difficulty level and status.Don’t rush through problems just to increase your count. Instead of focusing on the quantity of problems you solve, focus on what you learn from each problem.It’s far better to deeply understand and solve 50 problems than to superficially solve 500 problems.After solving a problem, ask yourself:Why does this solution work?What’s the one key insight that made everything else easier?Also, try to make it fun. There is a fun in learning to solve coding challenges. It’s not just about getting a job.Focus on learning PatternsThe key to getting better at LeetCode is learningas manypatterns as possible.Instead of focusing on individual questions, focus on identifying  that connect similar problems.On LeetCode, you’ll come across multiple problems that follow a similar patterns. Once you solve one of them, you can apply the same approach to solve others.For example: After learning the monotonic stack , I was able to solve over 10 similar problems.I made a  covering the 15 most important LeetCode patterns I learned after solving over 1,500 problems. You can check it out later.On , I’ve categorized problems by pattern. This makes it easy to focus on one pattern at a time. By going through the list, you will get to know all the important patterns for coding interviews.How to approach a new problem?1. Read the Problem Statement TwiceThe first time, focus on getting the big picture. What is the problem asking you to do?On the second read, pay attention to specific constraints and conditions. These small details often provide clues for optimizing your solution.2. Analyze the Input and Output ExamplesCarefully go through the examples provided in the problem.Walk through the input and output step by step to understand how the problem works. I have found that, many times simply walking through a few examples helped me figure out the solution.3. Visualize with pen and paperMany problems specially the ones related to trees and graphs are much easier to understand when you draw them out.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios and input sizes. Think about any  that might come up.4. Start with a Brute Force ApproachDon’t expect to come up with the most optimal solution right away.First see, if you can solve the problems using a brute force approach. While it might not be efficient, it gives you a baseline to improve upon.5. Optimize Your SolutionOnce you have a brute force solution, focus on optimizing it.Here are few things to consider:Leverage Unused Information: Look for details you might have missed. For instance, if the problem states that the array is sorted, consider leveraging this to use binary search or a two-pointer approach.: If certain calculations are repeated multiple times, consider precomputing them. Use techniques like  or  to avoid redundant calculations. Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.Make Time vs. Space Tradeoffs: Sometimes, using additional memory (e.g., hash tables) can speed up your solution.Data Structure Brainstorm: Run through the popular data structures and try to apply each one to the problem at hand.Avoid overcomplicating your solution. At every stage ask yourself, "Is there a simpler way to do this?". This will not only make your solution easier to understand but it will also reduce the chances of errors during coding.7. Analyze Time and Space ComplexityDevelop the habit of analyzing the time and space complexity of every problem you submit.How much time should you spend on each problem?When you’re just starting out, even  can take a while to solve. That’s completely normal—don’t get discouraged if you can’t come up with a solution right away.Your main goal in the beginning should be to  and understanding the problem deeply. Real progress happens when you take the time to think, make mistakes and refine your approach.But, some problems involve specific tricks or patterns that are hard to figure out unless you’ve seen them before.Spending hours on such problems without progress can be counterproductive.Here’s a good rule of thumb:Give yourself  of focused effort for each problem.If you’re still stuck, it’s okay to look at hints or solutions.Read the official solution and and try to understand the top voted solutions on LeetCode discussion forum.Don’t just move on after viewing the solution. Try to grasp why the solution works.Rewrite the solution from scratch without looking at the code. Writing it yourself helps you internalize the approach and ensures you truly understand it.If you couldn’t solve the problem on your first attempt, mark it for  and revisit it after a few weeks. Revisiting problems helps reinforce your understanding and ensures long-term retention.One of the most common mistakes—one that I made myself—is  to difficult problems and moving on.At first, it might seem like a shortcut, but in reality, it’s a  for three main reasons:You’ll quickly forget memorized solutions. Without understanding the logic behind them, they won’t stick in your memory.Your problem-solving skills won’t improve. Memorization skips the critical thinking process, which is the real value of practicing coding problems.You’ll struggle in interviews. Most interviewers ask variants of problems or follow-up questions, and without a deep understanding, you won’t be able to adapt.Instead of memorizing, focus on understanding the solution, even if it takes hours.Break it down step by step and ask yourself:Why does this approach work?What’s the key insight that simplifies the problem?How can I apply this approach to similar problems?This effort pays off in the long term. The deeper your understanding, the more confident you’ll feel explaining your thought process during interviews.Practice in a timed environmentSolving a problem during an interview is very different from solving it from the comfort of your home.That’s why it’s a good idea to time-box yourself and practice in a timed environment after you have learned the basics and solved 100-150 problems.Simply turn on a timer while practicing and try to complete the problem within that time.For , aim to complete them in For , set a timer for For , allow yourself To take your practice a step further:Try  by simulating past LeetCode contests.It’s okay if you struggle to solve even one problem initially—this is normal. The goal is to gain experience solving problems within a time limit.When I started participating in contests, I could only solve 1-2 problems. But with consistent practice, I improved to solving 3 problems, and eventually, I was able to solve all of them in some contests.Getting good at LeetCode isn’t just about learning new concepts or solving problems—it’s also about retaining that knowledge over time.That’s why you should regularly revisit concepts and problems you’ve already solved, especially the ones you found challenging.Try to solve those problems again without looking at the solution.By practicing consistently and revisiting old problems, you’ll make it much easier to retain what you’ve learned over time.I discuss more about how to effectively revise LeetCode problems in this article, so make sure to check it out: Getting good at LeetCode takes time.Some topics might take weeks or even months to master, and that’s okay. Be patient with yourself and remember: It’s completely normal to feel stuck or frustrated when working on a tough problem or grasping a complex topic.If a problem feels too hard, take a break, then come back to it with a fresh perspective.The more you practice, the better you will get at solving LeetCode problems.If you found this article helpful and want to dive deeper, consider becoming a .

Using techniques developed over 2,500 years ago, the team takes on the ultimate challenge of recreating a sarcophagus. Can modern hands replicate ancient ingenuity?

Taken from 'Building the Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

// Abstract
Lloyds Banking Group is on a mission to embrace the power of cloud and unlock the opportunities that it provides. Andrew, Michelle, and their MLOps team have been on a journey over the last 12 months to take their portfolio of circa 10 Machine Learning models in production and migrate them from an on-prem solution to a cloud-based environment. During the podcast, Michelle and Andrew share their reflections as well as some dos (and don’ts!) of managing the migration of an established portfolio.

// Bio

The technique, detailed in a new paper, requires programmers to use a restricted version of C called "Mini-C" that excludes features like pointer arithmetic. The researchers successfully tested their conversion system on two major code libraries, including the 80,000-line HACL* cryptographic library. Parts of the converted code have already been integrated into Mozilla's NSS and OpenSSH security systems, according to the researchers.

Amid this flurry of chaos, there exists an age-old profession - midwifery. You’d think helping parents bring their children into this world would be considered a noble pursuit. But being a midwife has never been simple. They were lauded as heroes in one century, persecuted as witches in the next, and are still given the occasional side-eye today.

As always he is joined by Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson who talks him through the history of all the pistols, rifles and machine guns employed in the conflict.

First up is the Webley Revolver Mk VI, first introduced during the stalemate of static and bloody trench warfare in 1915. Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley’s returning to front line service in the conflict.

Second is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.

Third up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.

Last but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren’s box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition.

For years, Jean Béliveau walked from country to country, with the goal of circumnavigating the globe on foot. While few people have the time or desire to walk such extreme lengths, research shows that adding even a modest amount of walking to your daily routine can dramatically improve your health. So, what exactly happens to your body when you increase your step count? Shannon Odell investigates.

The mission put a man on the moon for the very first time, winning the Space Race for the United States.  

The rocket that made it possible was Saturn V. As tall as a 36-story building, it was the most powerful that had ever flown, symbolising American technological dominance during the Cold War. 

And yet, the man who designed it had a dark past. During the Second World War, he had been at the forefront of the Nazi Secret Weapons programme, designing weapons which cost thousands of lives. His name was Werner von Braun.

*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film “The woman in the moon” (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film (used for illustrative purposes in the video) was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it’s technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work.

They determine which items are removed to make room for new ones.In this article, we’ll dive into 7 Cache Eviction Strategies explaining what they are, how they work, their pros and cons. provides deep session replays with every detail you need to find and fix a bug. From frontend screens to backend traces, metrics, and logs, all in one place. Debug faster and fix customer problems more easily, so you and your team can stay focused on building great software, not combing through APM data. (LRU) evicts the item that hasn’t been used for the longest time.The idea is simple: if you haven’t accessed an item in a while, it’s less likely to be accessed again soon.: LRU keeps track of when each item in the cache was last accessed. This can be done using various data structures, such as a  or a combination of a  and a .Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, it is moved to the  position in the tracking data structure (e.g., moving it to the front of a list).Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the item isn’t in the cache and the cache has free space, it is added directly.If the cache is full, the  is evicted to make space for the new item.The item that has been accessed least recently (tracked at the beginning of the list) is removed from the cache.Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:: Empty cache.Access  → Cache: [B, C, A] (A becomes recently used)Add → Cache: [C, A, D] (B is evicted as it's the “least recently used”): Easy to understand and widely adopted.: Keeps frequently accessed items in the cache.Optimized for Real-World Usage: Matches many access patterns, such as web browsing and API calls.: Tracking usage order can consume additional memory.: For large caches, maintaining the access order may introduce computational overhead.: Assumes past access patterns will predict future usage, which may not always hold true. (LFU) evicts the item with the lowest access frequency. It assumes that items accessed less frequently in the past are less likely to be accessed in the future.Unlike LRU, which focuses on , LFU emphasizes  of access.: LFU maintains a frequency count for each item in the cache, incrementing the count each time the item is accessed.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, its frequency count is increased.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the cache has available space, the new item is added with an initial frequency count of 1.If the cache is full, the item with the lowest frequency is evicted to make room for the new item. If multiple items share the same lowest frequency, a secondary strategy (like LRU or FIFO) resolves ties.: Remove the item with the smallest frequency count.Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:: Empty cache.Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=1), D (freq=1)] (B is evicted as it has the lowest frequency).Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=2), D (freq=1)]Efficient for Predictable Patterns: Retains frequently accessed data, which is often more relevant.Highly Effective for Popular Data: Works well in scenarios with clear "hot" items.: Requires additional memory to track frequency counts.: Tracking and updating frequency can slow down operations.: May keep items that were frequently accessed in the past but are no longer relevant.3. First In, First Out (FIFO)FIFO evicts the item that was added first, regardless of how often it’s accessed.FIFO operates under the assumption that items added earliest are least likely to be needed as the cache fills up.: When an item is added to the cache, it is placed at the end of the queue.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): No changes are made to the order of items. FIFO does not prioritize recently accessed items.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If there is space in the cache, the new item is added to the end of the queue.If the cache is full, the item at the front of the queue (the oldest item) is evicted to make space for the new item.: The oldest item, which has been in the cache the longest, is removed to make room for the new item.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is evicted because it was added first).Access  → Cache: [B, C, D] (Order remains unchanged).Add  → Cache: [C, D, E] (B is evicted because it was the oldest remaining item).: FIFO is straightforward and requires minimal logic.: No need to track additional metadata like access frequency or recency.: Eviction follows a predictable order.: Items still in frequent use can be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.Suboptimal for Many Use Cases: FIFO is rarely ideal in modern systems where recency and frequency matter.: If old but frequently used items are evicted, the cache loses its utility.4. Random Replacement (RR)RR cache eviction strategy is the simplest of all: when the cache is full, it evicts a random item to make space for a new one.It doesn't track recency, frequency, or insertion order, making it a lightweight approach with minimal computational overhead.This simplicity can sometimes be surprisingly effective, especially in systems with unpredictable or highly dynamic access patterns.: When an item is added to the cache and there is space, it is stored directly. If the requested item exists in the cache, it is served, and no changes are made to the cache. If the item is not in the cache and the cache is full, a random item is removed.: The randomly selected item is removed, and the new item is added to the cache.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is randomly evicted).Add  → Cache: [C, E, D] (B is randomly evicted).: No need for metadata like access frequency or recency.: Computational and memory requirements are minimal.Fair for Unpredictable Access Patterns: Avoids bias toward recency or frequency, which can be useful in some scenarios.: A frequently used item might be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.Inefficient for Stable Access Patterns: Doesn’t adapt well when certain items are consistently accessed.High Risk of Poor Cache Hit Rates: Random eviction often leads to suboptimal retention of important items.5. Most Recently Used (MRU) is the opposite of Least Recently Used (LRU). In MRU, the item that was accessed most recently is the first to be evicted when the cache is full.The idea behind MRU is that the most recently accessed item is likely to be a temporary need and won’t be accessed again soon, so evicting it frees up space for potentially more valuable data.: When a new item is added to the cache, it is marked as the most recently used.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, it is marked as the most recently used.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the cache has available space, the new item is added directly.If the cache is full, the most recently used item is evicted to make room for the new item.: The item that was accessed or added most recently is removed.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Access  → Cache: [A, B, C] (C is marked as the most recently used).Add  → Cache: [A, B, D] (C is evicted as it was the most recently used).Access  → Cache: [A, B, D] (B becomes the most recently used).Add  → Cache: [A, D, E] (B is evicted as it was the most recently used).Effective in Specific Scenarios: Retains older data, which might be more valuable in certain workloads.: Requires minimal metadata.Suboptimal for Most Use Cases: MRU assumes recent data is less valuable, which is often untrue for many applications.Poor Hit Rate in Predictable Patterns: Fails in scenarios where recently accessed data is more likely to be reused.: Limited applicability compared to other strategies like LRU or LFU. is a cache eviction strategy where each cached item is assigned a fixed lifespan. Once an item’s lifespan expires, it is automatically removed from the cache, regardless of access patterns or frequency.This ensures that cached data remains fresh and prevents stale data from lingering in the cache indefinitely.: When an item is added to the cache, a TTL value (e.g., 10 seconds) is assigned to it. The expiration time is usually calculated as .Cache Access (Hit or Miss): When an item is accessed, the cache checks its expiration time:If the item is expired, it is removed from the cache, and a cache miss is recorded.If the item is valid, it is served as a cache hit.: Expired items are automatically removed either during periodic cleanup or on access.Let’s assume a cache with a TTL of 5 seconds:Add  with TTL = 5s → Cache: [A (expires in 5s)]Add  with TTL = 10s → Cache: [A (5s), B (10s)]After 6 seconds → Cache: [B (expires in 4s)] (A is evicted because its TTL expired).Add  with TTL = 5s → Cache: [B (4s), C (5s)]If an item is accessed after its TTL expires, it results in a cache miss.TTL is often implemented in caching systems like  or , where you can specify expiration times for each key.: Automatically removes stale data, ensuring only fresh items remain in the cache.: TTL values are easy to assign during cache insertion.: No need to track usage patterns or access frequency.: Stale data is cleared out systematically, avoiding cache bloat.: Items may be evicted prematurely even if they are frequently accessed.: Items that haven’t expired but are still irrelevant occupy cache space.: TTL doesn’t adapt to dynamic workloads or usage patterns.Two-Tiered Caching combines two layers of cache—usually a  (in-memory) and a  (distributed or shared). The local cache serves as the first layer (hot cache), providing ultra-fast access to frequently used data, while the remote cache acts as the second layer (cold cache) for items not found in the local cache but still needed relatively quickly.:Resides on the same server as the application, often in memory (e.g., ,  in the application)..Provides ultra-fast access to frequently accessed data, reducing latency and server load.Examples: In-memory data structures like  or frameworks like .Remote Cache (Second Tier):Shared across multiple servers in the system. Slightly slower due to network overhead but offers larger storage and shared consistency.Used to store data that is not in the local cache but is still frequently needed.Examples: Distributed cache systems like  or .A client request checks the  first.If the data is not found (cache miss), it queries the .If the data is still not found (another cache miss), it retrieves the data from the primary data source (e.g., a database), stores it in both the local and remote caches, and returns it to the client.: Local cache provides near-instantaneous response times for frequent requests.: Remote cache adds scalability and allows data sharing across multiple servers.: Two-tiered caching significantly minimizes calls to the backend database.: If the local cache fails, the remote cache acts as a fallback.: Managing two caches introduces more overhead, including synchronization and consistency issues.: Inconsistent updates between tiers may lead to serving stale data.Increased Latency for Remote Cache Hits: Accessing the second-tier remote cache is slower than the local cache.If you found this article helpful and want to dive deeper, consider becoming a .

Watson, a renowned psychologist, and Rosalie Rayner, his assistant and eventual wife, decided to combine love, science, and a fair bit of cluelessness in an experiment that would go down in history as “The Little Albert Experiment.” The idea was bold, the execution debatable, and the results as ethically murky as a midsummer mud puddle. Thus, in a story one might mistake for the beginning of a Dickensian epic, Little Albert’s fate was sealed.

I mainly write in Rust where I used to write in Go. Overall, the language is more complex than Go and sometimes confusing with the borrow checker, but in general, it is quite convenient to write – I can't say that the speed of writing code significantly decreases compared to other languages – in general, the approaches that need to be used are roughly the same for all languages.crates ecosystem – many libraries available and can be installed in one commandsingle binary file and low memory consumptionability to write applications of various directions (web-app, tui, gui, parsers, etc.)What I don't like about Rust:a large number of sub-dependencies for web projects (any project on axum will contain 200+ dependencies)use of C-binding in "core" libraries like rust-tls (ring) – complicates cross-compilation because you have to maintain a C toolchain as well (fixed through Zig build, but it looks monstrous)It's nice to write various parsers in Rust, and then they can be coolly parallelized (with rayon or tokio), in Go I had a problems with this due to immutable strings and lack of GC control.The main languages remained the same: Python, NodeJS/TypeScript. I also actively used NextJS on several projects, overall I was satisfied – it's faster and easier to write frontends, but it's quite difficult to find problem's solutions sometimes (many Github issues, often they are open, and the comments contain answers that no longer work).The main fail of the year in the NodeJS ecosystem is the update of ESLint from 8 -> 9 – completely incompatible API with all existing plugins, the configuration file became larger and more complex – it's not clear why the authors made this diversion. I also tried Binome as an alternative to ESLint / Prettier, but it's completely different and you need to redo a lot, and not everything you need is available at the moment, I continue to monitor this project.I also tried Zig, but didn't write anything serious. Personally, I didn't understand why this language is needed. At the time I tried it, there was no even package manager yet. Obviously Zig is a competitor to C (not Rust), but C is now much richer in its toolkit and support in other languages. The only thing I can point out is  which can build C projects too and does it with less problems.I want to separately note about use of GPTs in work. I have an opportunity to do business tasks in the format of parsing and analyzing texts. What a couple of years ago was done with a bunch of regex, etc., can now be done through GPT and it works great! I tried using local Llama2, but it would have taken weeks to process my data on M2 chip. I redo the solution to use ChatGPT API and processed the data in a couple of days. It's good that all LLMs support openai-client API in Python, so the code almost didn't need to be rewritten. Among the disadvantages of LLama-like aka local running, I also want to note the lack of support for Function calling (to guarantee to bring the LLM response to the desired structure, in my case). The last time I did something serious was more than six months ago, maybe a lot has changed. I also tested gemma2, the inference speed was impressive, and the quality of the answers was not much worse.As local runners, I used llama.cpp and https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx – the second one uses Mac resources better (checked through macmon), but new models come out a bit slower on it. Some people use ollama, but I didn't understand why, considering that it has an incompatible client with openai-client API and slower performance.Initially, I ran my blog only on Medium, but it's not comfortable to write text there – it's much easier to write and edit in the same editor where I write code (plus my editor has Copilot). Therefore, I decided to move my blog to a static page generator. As an engine, I chose Zola (Rust-based, simple, and fast); I also tried Astro, but it's too big and complex for such a simple task. Overall, Zola is good, but it lacks some filters in templating, not enough flexibility in file structure, and not all popular languages are supported in code highlighting.I left Medium as a fallback for old readers. I also made a cross-post on dev.to, but there are very few views. Medium is disappointed with the lack of the ability to automate cross-posting (they have a deprecated API, but it does not support updating articles and code highlights). Most likely, it's possible to reverse engineer how they save articles through their editor (changes are sent as diffs). Does anyone else need this besides me?Last year I launched several new projects (in chronological order):timewiz.cc (, ) – a tool to find common working hours for distributed teams (an alternative to worldtimebuddy.com, I don't remember exactly why I made my own version). Score: fail.ecloop (, ) – secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation for Apple chips. Mainly an educational project to understand cryptography, SIMD optimizations, etc. Added several standard use cases for finding Bitcoin keys by brute force, but mathematically this is pointless, so as I said earlier, this is more of an interesting educational project (and I wanted to publish a series of articles on cryptography, but didn't have time last year, I hope to do it this year). Some people use this project in hopes of finding something. I also had ideas to add Metal API support – but that takes a lot of time, so I switched to other projects. Score: okay.macmon (, ) – TUI program for monitoring MacOS performance (CPU/GPU/ANE usage, RAM, temps). My first public Rust project, a lot of reverse engineering of how powermetrics in MacOS works, C-bindings. The project is used both by users in TUI mode and by other projects in headless mode (JSON metrics). Score: success.ghstats (, , , ) – a small self-hosted service that collects and saves GitHub repo statistics, has several built-in views and an API to retrieve all statistics. The project started well, but then kind of fizzled out in terms of issues and feature requests, most likely users are satisfied with the current functionality. I would like to add more visualizations, but I haven't had time for that yet. The main thing for now is that the statistics are collected and saved, so something can be done with this in the future. Technically, I like that the service consumes only 10 MB of RAM. Score: okay.ogp (, , ) – a small project for generating OGP articles preview as a service. Used in this blog (you can check by sending this article to your friends in a messenger or social network 😀). Worked with the SVG standard (I thought it was more adequate) and generating PNG from SVG. Score: more of fail.compose-updater (, ) – a project for updating the version of a docker image from CI in a closed infrastructure. I didn't find anything ready to solve this task. There is watchtower, but it's more about keeping up-to-date docker images, rather than updating a specific one, and also I couldn't run it with ECR repos – the author made a super minimalist image in which I couldn't enter through  to debug. The second alternative is umputun/updater, but it's more about running different shell commands through a webhook. I chose Python because I didn't find a Rust crate for Docker API (most likely it exists, I just didn't understand which one is really good). Score: – (I didn't promote the project anywhere, I use it for my own purposes for now).twscrape (, ) – a library for parsing data from X/Twitter. Mainly the project is in maintenance mode, I check its functionality every few months, and there have been no requests for new features.apigen-ts (, ) – a library for generating TypeScript client OpenAPI spec. I continue to use it in my projects; I also see that there are a small number of other users. My relevance has slightly decreased due to the NextJS/TRPC stack, but in other configurations (e.g. FastApi + React), it is still relevant, so use it. Periodically there are requests to fix something or add a feature.I also have several projects that I didn't finish and abandoned. I'll write about them here, maybe someone needs something from this, then I can return to on it. – cross-posting between static blog, Medium, Dev.to, Substack, and collecting joined article statistics. I abandoned the project due to the lack of an API at Medium – the only solution I found was through protocol reverse and session cookie. – a program to walk Bitcoin-like blockchain and compile the final UTXO list. I abandoned it because I couldn't figure out how to effectively create a HashMap-like structure with external memory support to run on computers with small RAM (less than 32GB, LOL). – a program that listens to all incoming messages in Telegram (chats & channels) and saves their history in a separate database with the ability to search through these messages later. I have the first version that just saves messages in json files, but I didn't develop the idea further.I'm not a big tech geek, but I want to say about a few devices which made my life easier:MeLE Fanless Quieter 4C – a small fanless PC for , I use it as a native Linux via SSH for testing various programs and keep some cron jobs on it for data collection. It's cool that it's silent because it has no fan, but it heats up a lot under load. The performance of the N100 chip surprised me – only 2x slower than M2 chip (tested with , single core).Promate HDMI-PD100 – nice cable format to connect a monitor and my Mac. One cable is needed to charge and transmit the video stream. Before that, I used hubs, but it's a big block. I'm glad I see fewer wires.Over the year, 8 articles were published, totaling 9039 words (~45 minutes to read), and gained 5203 views. Top 3 articles:Data aggregated from this site (with umami), Medium, and Dev.to. Script.Public GitHub projects – totaling 312 commits, 49 issues closed, 43 releases created, and 1394 stars gained. Top-3 repos:Data aggregated with .I hope I will see a different top with new projects this year 😀In  repository I was asked to make it possible to send coffee as donations. Over the year I received 38 cups of coffee from 10 people. I spend these coffees on an annual Parallels subscription, which allows me to test some apps on Windows. Also, I partially paid from this fund for MeLE and VPS, which I used to test apps as well. Many thanks for supporting my work!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sara Bareilles&apos;s unforgettable performance of &apos;Love Song&apos; | NEXT at the Kennedy Center</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imRLUH2WaFI</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 23:00:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/3CBecJa | #KenCenNextPBS

With Windows 10 reaching end of support in October 2025, many users will face decisions about upgrading hardware for Windows 11 or considering different operating systems entirely. Linux distributions have evolved to offer increasingly polished desktop experiences, with improving hardware compatibility and familiar user interfaces. 

2024 saw Linux adoption grow thanks to the Steam Deck's success, reaching a 4.04% market share in December, up from 3.85% during the same time last year.

One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys two years ago, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Fall of Constantinople</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/constantinople-under-siege</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[May 1453 saw the siege that would lead to the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Started in 1984 (and inspired partly by a bug in the classic Bourne shell), it's "the Internet's oldest contest," acording to their official social media account on Mastodon. 

The contest enters its "pending" state today at 2024-12-29 23:58 UTC — meaning an opening date for submissions has been officially scheduled (for January 31st) as well as a closing date roughly eight weeks later on April 1st, 2025. That's according to the newly-released (proposed and tentative) rules and guidelines, listing contest goals like "show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way" and "stress C compilers with unusual code." And the contest's home page adds an additional goal: "to have fun with C!" 

Excerpts from the official rules:


Rule 0 
Just as C starts at 0, so the IOCCC starts at rule 0. :-) 

Rule 1 
Your submission must be a complete program.... 

Rule 5 
Your submission MUST not modify the content or filename of any part of your original submission including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile (that we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data files you submit.... 


Rule 6 
I am not a rule, I am a free(void *human); 
 while (!(ioccc(rule(you(are(number(6)))))) {
 ha_ha_ha();
 } 

 
Rule 6 is clearly a reference to The Prisoner... (Some other rules are even sillier...) And the guidelines include their own jokes:
 You are in a maze of twisty guidelines, all different. 

There are at least zero judges who think that Fideism has little or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.... 


We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' source. The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.
 

And this weekend there was also a second announcement:

After a 4 year effort by a number of people, with over 6168+ commits, the Great Fork Merge has been completed and the Official IOCCC web site has been updated! A significant number of improvements has been made to the IOCCC winning entries. A number of fixes and improvements involve the ability of reasonable modern Unix/Linux systems to be able to compile and even run them. 

Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader — and C programmer — achowe for sharing the news.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Did The First Airship Fly | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfqOdu601yE</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 16:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this ultimate challenge, this team works hard to fly an airship.

Over time, MTV became the home of everything from Beavis and Butthead to Jackass to Teen Mom. Naturally, in the process of courting young people’s attention, MTV has courted controversy. All those programs mentioned above, plus many more, have pushed the envelope of good taste and what’s acceptable on TV.

The latest version of the language pushes the envelope further for speed and power, sheds many of Python's most decrepit elements, and broadens its appeal with developers worldwide. Here's a look back at the year in Python. 

In the biggest news of the year, the core Python development team took a major step toward overcoming one of Python's longstanding drawbacks: the Global Interpreter Lock or "GIL," a mechanism for managing interpreter state. The GIL prevents data corruption across threads in Python programs, but it comes at the cost of making threads nearly useless for CPU-bound work. Over the years, various attempts to remove the GIL ended in tears, as they made single-threaded Python programs drastically slower. But the most recent no-GIL project goes a long way toward fixing that issue — enough that it's been made available for regular users to try out. 

The no-GIL or "free-threaded" builds are still considered experimental, so they shouldn't be deployed in production yet. The Python team wants to alleviate as much of the single-threaded performance impact as possible, along with any other concerns, before giving the no-GIL builds the full green light. It's also entirely possible these builds may never make it to full-blown production-ready status, but the early signs are encouraging. 
Another forward-looking feature introduced in Python 3.13 is the experimental just-in-time compiler or JIT. It expands on previous efforts to speed up the interpreter by generating machine code for certain operations at runtime. Right now, the speedup doesn't amount to much (maybe 5% for most programs), but future versions of Python will expand the JIT's functionality where it yields real-world payoffs.
 
Python is now more widely used than JavaScript on GitHub (thanks partly to its role in AI and data science code).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This is a segment of the interview I did with Punkwithacamera for my latest video on the channel!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ria8ZjQNTAI</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2024 01:54:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Luigi Supporter Speaks on Healthcare Claim Denials</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlAZhoebEUk</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 21:23:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a short from our full video, 'Free Luigi Rally,' which is currently live on our channel: https://youtu.be/iFAKkquGTxs]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Inside The Sophisticated Airbus A380 | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFm_Dt0qSY8</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2024 16:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's not just cars that need MOTs; planes do too.

Taken from 'City in the Sky' (2016)
At any one time, there are a million people flying above our heads. But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century. And with air-passenger numbers predicted to double in the next 20 years, it also looks at what the industry will have to do to keep up.

2024 saw over 60 elections worldwide, many of which were marked with controversy. It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. 

Despite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. 

2024 had much of the world voting for change. Onward, to 2025 where we will find out what it means.

Correction: At 4:16 we show the wrong clip of Pope Francis. Our clip shows him visiting Myanmar in 2017 — we meant to include a clip from his 2024 visit to Indonesia.

From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon Transformer-based AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet launched in June held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while OpenAI's o1 used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. Advanced Voice Mode and NotebookLM also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable music synthesis models and also better AI video generators, including several from China.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Seconds Since the Epoch</title><link>https://aphyr.com/posts/378-seconds-since-the-epoch</link><author>Aphyr</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 18:46:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://aphyr.com/posts.atom">Dev - Aphyr</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is not at all news, but it comes up often enough that I think there should be a concise explanation of the problem. People, myself included, like to say that POSIX time, also known as Unix time, is the numberofsecondssincetheUnixepoch, which was 1970-01-01 at 00:00:00.This is not true. Or rather, it isn’t true in the sense most people think. For example, it is presently 2024-12-25 at 18:51:26 UTC. The POSIX time is 1735152686. It has been 1735152713 seconds since the POSIX epoch. The POSIX time number is twenty-seven seconds lower.The  function returns the value of time in . A value to be interpreted as the number of seconds between a specified time and the Epoch. A Coordinated Universal Time name (specified in terms of seconds (), minutes (), hours (), days since January 1 of the year (), and calendar year minus 1900
()) is related to a time represented as  according to the expression below.If year < 1970 or the value is negative, the relationship is undefined. If year ≥ 1970 and the value is non-negative, the value is related to a Coordinated Universal Time name according to the expression: +  * 60 +  * 3600 +  * 86400 +
(-70) * 31536000 + (( - 69) / 4) * 86400The length of the day is not 86,400 seconds, and in fact changes over time. To keep UTC days from drifting too far from solar days, astronomers periodically declare a leap second in UTC. Consequently, every few years POSIX time jumps backwards, wreakingutterhavoc. Someday it might jump forward.Appendix B of IEEE 1003 has a fascinating discussion of leap seconds:The concept of leap seconds is added for precision; at the time this standard was published, 14 leap seconds had been added since January 1, 1970. These 14 seconds are ignored to provide an easy and compatible method of computing time differences.I, too, love to ignore things to make my life easy. The standard authors knew “seconds since the epoch” were not, in fact, seconds since the epoch. And they admit as much:Most systems’ notion of “time” is that of a continuously-increasing value, so this value should increase even during leap seconds. However, not only do most systems not keep track of leap seconds, but most systems are probably not synchronized to any standard time reference. Therefore, it is inappropriate to require that a time represented as seconds since the Epoch precisely represent the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch.It is sufficient to require that applications be allowed to treat this time as if it represented the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch. It is the responsibility of the vendor of the system, and the administrator of the system, to ensure that this value represents the number of seconds between the referenced time and the Epoch as closely as necessary for the application being run on that system….I imagine there was some debate over this point. The appendix punts, saying that vendors and administrators must make time align “as closely as necessary”, and that “this value should increase even during leap seconds”. The latter is achievable, but the former is arguably impossible: the standard requires POSIX clocks be twenty-seven seconds off.Consistent interpretation of seconds since the Epoch can be critical to certain types of distributed applications that rely on such timestamps to synchronize events. The accrual of leap seconds in a time standard is not predictable. The number of leap seconds since the Epoch will likely increase. The standard is
more concerned about the synchronization of time between applications of astronomically short duration and the Working Group expects these concerns to become more critical in the future.In a sense, the opposite happened. Time synchronization is  off, so systems generally function (however incorrectly) when times drift a bit. But leap seconds are rare, and the linearity evoked by the phrase “seconds since the epoch” is so deeply baked in to our intuition, that software can accrue serious, unnoticed bugs. Until a few years later, one of those tiny little leap seconds takes down a big chunk of the internet.If you just need to compute the duration between two events on one computer, use , or better yet, . If you don’t need to exchange timestamps with other systems that assume POSIX time, use TAI, GPS, or maybe LORAN. If you do need rough alignment with other POSIX-timestamp systems, smear leap seconds over a longer window of time. Libraries like qntm’s t-a-i can convert back and forth between POSIX and TAI.There’s an ongoing effort to end leap seconds, hopefully by 2035. It’ll require additional work to build conversion tables into everything that relies on the “86,400 seconds per day” assumption, but it should also make it much simpler to ask questions like “how many seconds between these two times”. At least for times after 2035!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2247 - Duncan Trussell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2024 18:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Duncan Trussell is a stand-up comic, host of the "Duncan Trussell Family Hour" podcast, and voice of "Hippocampus" on the television series "Krapopolis."

Sometimes we establish something as a historical “first” or historical “last.” Other times, we label people, places, or periods as the “worst” because, well, they’re kind of awful. But finding the “most” of something can also put history into perspective - strange world records right out of the Guinness book that offer surprising insight into the past. Some of these “mosts” are genuine testaments to human strength, endurance, creativity, and spirit, while others, are not so much.

Holistic Evaluation of Generative AI Systems // MLOps Podcast #280 with Jineet Doshi, Staff AI Scientist or AI Lead at Intuit.

// Abstract
Evaluating LLMs is essential in establishing trust before deploying them to production. Even post deployment, evaluation is essential to ensure LLM outputs meet expectations, making it a foundational part of LLMOps. However, evaluating LLMs remains an open problem. Unlike traditional machine learning models, LLMs can perform a wide variety of tasks such as writing poems, Q&A, summarization etc. This leads to the question how do you evaluate a system with such broad intelligence capabilities? This talk covers the various approaches for evaluating LLMs such as classic NLP techniques, red teaming and newer ones like using LLMs as a judge, along with the pros and cons of each. The talk includes evaluation of complex GenAI systems like RAG and Agents. It also covers evaluating LLMs for safety and security and the need to have a holistic approach for evaluating these very capable models.

In May, the organization was hit with an attack that caused mass disruptions as staff was forced to move to manual processes that caused errors, delayed or lost lab results, and diversions of ambulances to other hospitals. Ascension managed to restore most services by mid-June. At the time, the company said the attackers had stolen protected health information and personally identifiable information for an undisclosed number of people.A filing Ascension made earlier in December revealed that nearly 5.6 million people were affected by the breach. Data stolen depended on the particular person but included individuals' names and medical information (e.g., medical record numbers, dates of service, types of lab tests, or procedure codes), payment information (e.g., credit card information or bank account numbers), insurance information (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare ID, policy number, or insurance claim), government

One such tool is pre-commit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language  hooks. You use pre-commit to run one or more tools before allowing you to commit your code locally. For example, you might run the Flake8 linter or the Ruff formatter on your Python code in GitHub Actions or some other CI. But rather than waiting for CI to run, you want to run those checks locally and automatically.That is where pre-commit comes in. You tell pre-c0mmit what to run, and it will run right before it allows you to commit your code.If any of those checks fail, you must fix your code before committing it.pre-commit is a Python package, so you can install it using pip. Here’s the command you’ll need to run in your terminal:Once pre-commit is installed, you can confirm that it works by running the following:The next step is to navigate to one of your local GitHub code bases in your terminal. Once inside one of your repos, you will need to run this command:This command installs pre-commit in your  folder so that pre-commit runs whenever you commit. But how does pre-commit know what to run?You have to define what  runs using a special YAML file. You’ll learn how in the next section!Adding a pre-commit ConfigurationYou need to add a file named  (note the leading period) into the root of your repo. If you want to generate a simple config file, you can run this command:Here’s an example config for running Black on your code:repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.10.0
    hooks:
    -   id: blackPersonally, I like to run the Ruff formatter and linter as well as a couple of defaults, so I use this config a lot:repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v3.2.0
    hooks:
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: check-added-large-files

- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.1.7
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
When you add a new rule to pre-commit, you should run that rule against all the files in your repo so you don’t have any surprises later on. To do that, you need to run this command:pre-commit run --all-filesOnce you have run all your new rules against all your code files, you can start working on your next feature or bug fix. Then, when you run,   the pre-commit hooks will run, and you’ll see if your code is good enough to pass.There are TONs of hooks you can add to pre-commit. A lot of them are mentioned on the pre-commit website. You can add Mypy, pytest, and much, much more to your pre-commit hooks. Just don’t get too crazy, or they may take too long to run, and you’ll go nuts waiting for it.Overall, running so many of your CI hooks locally is great because your machine is usually faster than waiting on a queue in CI. Give it a try and see what think!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Every measure of Chopin&apos;s Barcarolle is a miracle (ft.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, 3 people decided to sell snowboarding equipment online.And set up an e-commerce platform.Yet their business model failed.So they pivoted to create a software-as-a-service model with the e-commerce platform and called it Shopify.Their growth rate was explosive.But they wanted to keep it simple and reduce costs.So they built Shopify using a classic monolith architecture in Ruby on Rails.As time passed, they added features to scale the business.Yet it increased the codebase complexity.And became difficult to understand & maintain the code.So they  moving to a microservices architecture.Although it’ll temporarily solve their issues, it might create newer problems.Each microservice needs a separate deployment pipeline.So it’ll increase the effort and costs.Also security vulnerabilities must be updated in each microservice.So it’ll increase the system complexity.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re on Bluesky:They wanted the benefits of monolith and microservices architecture.But ditch the problems coming with it.So they set up a modular monolith.They designed each module around a specific business domain.Think of as grouping functionalities from a business area within a module. Put simply, related functionalities get stored in a specific module.Also they created a  for each module and hid the internal logic & data behind it. It let them:Understand the behavior of a module easily.Modify a module without breaking others.Imagine  as a measure of dependency between 2 modules.A module will always depend on something.Yet dependencies must be minimized.So they merged modules with many dependencies on each other. (It happens when domain boundaries aren’t set properly.)They designed modules to communicate with each other via public API - function calls. And threw errors if anything got accessed outside the public API.Each module can be deployed as a separate process for fault isolation.So they deploy every module within the same process.They organized code so each module contains a business domain. Put simply, each directory represents a specific business domain. For example, the code for orders and payments modules will be in separate directories.Also they set up separate database schemas for each module. And avoided transactions across them to avoid coupling & achieve data isolation.A modular monolith is a better way to organize code than a classic monolith. Here are its benefits:It’s easier to modify code as the area of code change is limited. (Compared to layered architecture in a classic monolith.)Developer productivity is high because the codebase is easier to understand.There’s no network overhead because functional calls are enough. (Compared to microservices.)It’s easier to deploy because there’s only a single app.The infrastructure costs are low because there’s only a single codebase.Besides a modular monolith makes the transition to microservices easier.Each architecture has its tradeoffs:It’s difficult to scale only a specific module in a modular monolith, so resources might get wasted.Also failure impact is high because every module runs in the same process.Each architectural pattern solves a specific problem.Yet there’s no silver bullet.So the correct solution depends on your needs and scale.While Shopify remains one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world.And handled 30TB traffic per minute during black friday.👋 PS - Are you unhappy at your current job?And preparing for system design interviews to get your dream job can be stressful.Don't worry, I'm working on content to help you pass the system design interview.

The T2 Linux team has unveiled T2 Linux SDE 24.12, codenamed "Sky's the Limit!", delivering a massive update for this highly portable source-based Linux distribution... With 3,280 package updates, 206 new features, and the ability to boot on systems with as little as 512MB RAM, this release further strengthens T2 Linux's position as the ultimate tool for developers working across diverse hardware and embedded systems.
 
Some highlights from Rene's announcement:

 "The release includes 37 pre-compiled ISOs with Glibc, Musl, and uClibc, supporting 25 CPU architectures like ARM(64), RISCV(64), Loongarch64, SPARC(64), and vintage retro computing platforms such as M68k, Alpha, and even initial Nintendo Wii U support added."
" The Cosmic Desktop, a modern Rust-based environment, debuts alongside expanded application support for non-mainstream RISC architectures, now featuring LibreOffice, OpenJDK, and QEMU."

And T2sde.org gives this glimpse of the future: 

"While initially created for the Linux kernel, T2 already has proof-of-concept support for building 'home-brew' pkg for Other OS, including: BSDs, macOS and Haiku. Work on alternative micro kernels, such as L4, Fuchsia, RedoxOS or integrating building 'AOSP' Android is being worked on as well."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>4 Hours Of Forgotten WW2 Facts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSfSwZ_RfMQ</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 22:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Myths die hard, and the history of the 20th century is no exception to the rule.

Milan, 1494: Leonardo da Vinci was an exceptional man, and everyone who met him described him as a genius. And yet, he was now 42 years old – a middle-aged man in an era when life expectancy was 40 - And he still hadn’t produced anything that would be considered a masterpiece by his contemporaries. Many of his works were unfinished or in private collections, there were no great public works that people could see, no architectural marvels and no distinguished altarpieces for cathedrals.
Nothing that could be considered worthy of his potential. 

Then, he was asked to paint a wall.

They almost always have masses many millions of times that of the sun, while the biggest grow to tens of billions. Exactly what was responsible for seeding these great engines, and building up their immense sizes, is a challenge only the James Webb Telescope can rise to. 

The concept of “Engine Black Holes” came from a book I read as an 12 year old, which talked about the Direct Collapse model. I don’t know what book it was or what happened to it, but I intended to bring it to life in this video. Merry Christmas! And many happy returns in 2024.

There is a long history of regulation and deregulation where big scandals provide the catalyst for new rules, and then the realization that the rules are possibly excessive has caused them to be rolled back.

In finance the 1933 Glass-Steagall provisions came in the wake of the 1929 Crash. The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act was a reaction to the Enron and WorldCom scandals. Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis.

Good regulation can bring all sorts of benefits, but excessive regulation, does little to serve the public interest, and creates financial costs and frustration for businesses and the public. 

Elon Musk has vowed to dismantle thousands of federal regulations as the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying the nation’s financial security depends on it. Is he right, and if so, what rules need to go first?

Traditionally, software development has been supply-side constrained by the finite availability of skilled engineers. Despite immense investments, it is not uncommon to encounter software riddled with bugs and inefficiencies, even on platforms operated by billion-dollar companies. These issues reflect systemic bottlenecks that hinder the ability to meet growing demand for reliable, scalable software.Artificial intelligence promises to shift this paradigm. AI has the potential to address these constraints by automating repetitive tasks, assisting in decision-making, and optimizing workflows. AI can be viewed as a transformative horizontal layer akin to the electricity grid or the internet, it is an enabler. Its potential to impact nearly every process in an organization demands a rethinking of its role. The challenge becomes how to integrate it into the core of organizational operations.From Supply-Side Constraints to Human OrchestrationSoftware engineering relies heavily on human labor for execution at every level, from writing functions to debugging and maintaining systems. This reliance creates bottlenecks as demand for software outpaces the availability of skilled talent. While traditional tools improved productivity incrementally, they did not address the fundamental limitations of human bandwidth.AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), mark a significant departure from this trajectory. These systems enable assisted coding, provide architectural suggestions, and help identify design patterns and anti-patterns in real time. Engineers increasingly shift from writing low-level code to orchestrating systems: combining AI-generated components, validating their accuracy, and integrating them into larger workflows.Orchestration, as a human role, embodies this transition. It involves guiding AI to produce outcomes aligned with high-level design goals and ensuring that the resulting systems are robust, maintainable, and aligned with organizational objectives. This shift transforms engineers into curators of functionality and systems thinkers.AI as a Horizontal Layer: Shifting to the CenterAI’s impact extends far beyond isolated tools for code generation or testing. As a horizontal layer, AI can improve processes across an entire organization, from development and operations to customer support and strategy. Just as electricity and the internet became foundational to modern organizations, AI has the potential to underpin nearly every business process.To realize this potential, AI must move from a peripheral, supplementary role to the center of organizational decision-making and operations. This shift requires cultural, structural, and procedural changes:: AI should not be siloed within individual teams or projects. Organizations need a unified AI strategy that spans departments, with clearly defined goals for integrating AI into all workflows. Some processes will become automated entirely.AI-Driven Process Redesign: Processes must be redesigned to leverage AI fully. This includes automating repetitive tasks, improving data analysis pipelines, and enabling predictive decision-making across teams.: Engineers and domain experts must learn to collaborate with AI, focusing on curating inputs, validating outputs, and managing systems holistically. How to move data more efficiently into AI systems will be a key challenge.High-Value Decisions and Human OversightWhile AI can transform many areas, its role in high-value, high-stakes decisions remains limited. For example, while autopilot systems can technically manage most aspects of flight, human pilots are still in command due to the complex, high-risk nature of their work. Similarly, in software engineering, areas like system security, mission-critical infrastructure, and regulatory compliance rely heavily on human oversight.These environments present unique challenges for AI adoption:: Tasks requiring deep domain knowledge and precision, such as cryptographic algorithms, high-performance computing (HPC), or real-time trading systems, often fall outside AI’s general-purpose capabilities.: In scenarios where failure carries significant consequences (e.g., healthcare systems or aviation software), organizations are unlikely to entrust AI with autonomous decision-making.: High-value decisions often involve qualitative factors that AI struggles to interpret, such as ethical considerations or conflicting stakeholder priorities.In such contexts, AI will serve as an assistant rather than a replacement, helping humans process large datasets, identify patterns, and simulate potential outcomes. Feeding the right data into AI systems and asking the right questions become crucial skills, requiring close collaboration between domain experts and AI tools.The Evolving Role of Software Engineers and Technical LeadershipThe widespread adoption of AI reshapes the roles of engineers, technical leaders, and executives alike: Engineers increasingly move from function-level tasks to system-level orchestration. Their role becomes one of managing abstractions, curating AI outputs, and ensuring that automated components align with broader objectives. Proficiency in leveraging AI tools, debugging AI-generated code, and adapting workflows to accommodate AI capabilities will define the next generation of engineers. Specialization, as always, will continue to pay a premium for a significant while. As stewards of architectural integrity, staff engineers focus on integrating AI-generated components into larger systems. They ensure that AI outputs align with system-wide goals, resolve inconsistencies, and enforce reliability standards. Mentorship becomes a key responsibility as they guide teams in navigating AI-enhanced workflows. CXOs must lead the cultural and strategic shift toward AI-centric operations. This includes:Establishing governance frameworks for AI use.Identifying high-impact areas for AI integration.Balancing automation with human oversight to mitigate risks.From Creativity to Precision: AI’s Broader ImpactsAI’s influence spans domains that demand creativity, precision, and scalability. In creative processes, AI enables rapid iteration, empowering individuals to achieve what once required large teams. However, these gains depend on human expertise to guide and refine AI’s outputs. Creativity-focused AI tools will likely remain diverse and scattered, as outcomes depend heavily on subjective preferences and domain-specific tuning.In precision-oriented domains, such as accounting or high-performance computing, AI adoption faces greater challenges. The deterministic nature of these tasks requires accuracy and reliability that AI systems cannot consistently guarantee. While AI may play assistive roles in such environments, human oversight will remain indispensable for the foreseeable future.Future of Software Engineering in an AI-Driven WorldThe integration of AI into software engineering represents a profound transformation. It shifts the role of engineers from implementers to orchestrators, enables organizations to scale processes with unprecedented efficiency, and positions AI as a foundational layer of modern business operations. However, the successful adoption of AI requires careful planning, cultural adaptation, and a clear understanding of its limitations.Addressing supply-side constraints, enhancing human capabilities, and embedding itself as a horizontal layer, AI promises to unlock new levels of productivity and innovation. The future of software engineering lies in harnessing this potential — not by replacing humans, but by amplifying their ability to create, innovate, and solve complex problems at scale.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Insane Biology of: The Lion</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HWoXR8Qe4w</link><author>Real Science</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2024 13:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC176GAQozKKjhz62H8u9vQQ">Real Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gift a lifetime or yearly membership to Nebula here:
