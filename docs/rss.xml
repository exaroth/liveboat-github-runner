Resilient Multi-Cloud Strategies: Harnessing Kubernetes, Cluster API, and Cell-Based Architecture - Tasdik Rahman & Javi Mosquera, New Relic 

In today's multi-cloud world, resilience and high availability at scale are crucial. This session will cover how we utilized Kubernetes with Cluster API and other cloud native components, to deploy a cell-based architecture across multiple cloud providers, scaling to 270+ clusters and 18,000+ nodes, creating independent, isolated cells that limit failures and improve uptime, thus simplifying compliance, cost management, and disaster recovery planning.

We'll explore how Cluster API facilitates seamless automation of cluster creation and management across our multi-cloud setup, upgrades, enhancing autonomy and resilience. Moreover, we'll highlight real-world use cases sharing our learnings from automation built for efficient management of k8s clusters while limiting operational overhead.

End users will learn from this talk on how they can use ClusterAPI, to automate their multi cloud cluster lifecycle management and leverage cellular architecture to build a highly available setup.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Astronomers Confirm First &apos;Lone&apos; Black Hole Discovery - and It&apos;s in the Milky Way</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/20/2153201/astronomers-confirm-first-lone-black-hole-discovery---and-its-in-the-milky-way?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 21:55:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time, astronomers have confirmed the existence of a lone black hole," reports Science News — "one with no star orbiting it."



It's "the only one so far," says Kailash Sahu, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. In 2022, Sahu and his colleagues discovered the dark object coursing through the constellation Sagittarius. A second team disputed the claim, saying the body might instead be a neutron star. New observations from the Hubble Space Telescope now confirm that the object's mass is so large that it must be a black hole, Sahu's team reports in the April 20 Astrophysical Journal.... [And that second team has revised its assessment and now agrees: the object is a black hole.] 

While solitary black holes should be common, they are hard to find. The one in Sagittarius revealed itself when it passed in front of a dim background star, magnifying the star's light and slowly shifting its position due to the black hole's gravity. This passage occurred in July 2011, but the star's position is still changing. "It takes a long time to do the observations," Sahu says. "Everything is improved if you have a longer baseline and more observations." The original discovery relied on precise Hubble measurements of star positions from 2011 to 2017. The new work incorporates Hubble observations from 2021 and 2022 as well as data from the Gaia spacecraft. 

The upshot: The black hole is about seven times as massive as the sun, give or take 0.8 solar masses.... Located 5,000 light-years from Earth, this black hole is much closer than the supermassive one at the Milky Way's center, which also lies in Sagittarius but about 27,000 light-years from us. The star-rich region around the galactic center provides an ideal hunting ground for solitary black holes passing in front of stars. Sahu hopes to find additional lone black holes by using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, slated for launch in 2027.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/palantir-exec-defends-companys-immigration-surveillance-work/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 21:48:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the founders of startup accelerator Y Combinator offered unsparing criticism this weekend of the controversial data analytics company Palantir, leading a company executive to offer an extensive defense of Palantir’s work.

"But bioethicists and conservationists are expressing unease with the kind of scientific research," writes the Chicago Tribune. [Alternate URL here.]

"Unfortunately, as clever as this science is ... it's can-do science and not should-do science," said Lindsay Marshall, director of science in animal research at Humane World for Animals, formerly the Humane Society of the U.S.... Ed Heist, a professor at Southern Illinois University and a conservation geneticist, said the news bothered him. "This is not conservation, but people conflate it," he said. "The point is entertainment...." 

Naomi Louchouarn [program director of wildlife partnerships at Humane World for Animals], has dedicated her studies and research to the relationship between humans and animals, specifically carnivores like gray wolves. "The reason our current endangered species are becoming extinct is because we don't know how to coexist with them," she said. "And this doesn't solve that problem at all." Humans can treat the symptoms of wildlife conflict with "big, flashy silver bullets" and "in this case, advanced, inefficient science," she said, but the real solution is behavioral change. "Assuming that we could actually bring back a full population of animals," Louchouarn said, "which is so difficult and so crazy — that's a big if — I don't understand the point of trying to bring back a woolly mammoth when we already can't coexist with elephants." 

The article notes that even Colossal's chief science officer says their technology is at best one of several tools for fighting biodiversity loss, calling it a battle which humans are 'not close to winning'... We as a global community need to continue to invest in traditional approaches to conservation and habitat preservation, as well as in the protection of living endangered species." 
But the article adds that the Trump administration "is citing the case of the dire wolf as it moves to reduce federal protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973." (Wednesday U.S. interior secretary Doug Burgum has even posted on X "The concept of 'de-extinction' can serve as a bedrock for modern species conservation.") 

And the article adds that "During a livestreamed town hall with Interior Department employees on April 9, Burgum said: "If we're going to be in anguish about losing a species, now we have an opportunity to bring them back. Pick your favorite species and call up Colossal.

Ken Angielczyk, curator of mammal fossils at the Field Museum who researches extinct species that lived 200 to 300 million years ago, said it's a misguided approach. "If that's the basis ... for changing regulations related to the endangered species list, that is very, very premature," he said. "Because we can't resurrect things.... If the purpose is to restore the damage to the shared ecosystem, we have that opportunity right now," she said. "And that's the necessity immediately...." 

"This whole idea that extinction is reversible is so dangerous," Marshall said, "because then it stops us caring."

Mechanize was launched on Thursday via a post on X by its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup's goal, Besiroglu wrote, is "the full automation of all work" and "the full automation of the economy." 

Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible. Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize's total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. "The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year," he wrote. 
Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that "our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work" rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics... 

Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through "explosive economic growth." He points to a paper he published on the topic. "Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can't even imagine today," he told TechCrunch. 

TechCrunch wonders how jobless humans will produce goods — and whether wealth will simply concentrate around whoever owns the agents. 
But they do concede that Besiroglu may be right that "If each human worker has a personal crew of agents which helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How will AI change in ten years?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTG6soH-dFk</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HTG6soH-dFk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 19:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Professor Terry Sejnowski discusses what AI will look like in the next decade or two and how our lives will change as a result #shorts]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zelenskyy says Russian artillery fire has not subsided despite announced truce</title><link>https://tvpworld.com/86264734/ukrainian-official-says-russian-forces-still-open-fire-despite-ceasefire</link><author>/u/dat_9600gt_user</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 18:16:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Autistic teen breaks largest canvas art world record</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EZVk47zr30</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5EZVk47zr30?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 18:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nigerian autistic artist Kanyeyachukwu Tagbo-Okeke has carved out a global niche for himself with his art, winning the Guinness World Record for the largest artwork on canvas by an individual.

Mobile phone video recovered from one of the medics contradicts Israel's initial account that the medics' vehicles did not have emergency lights flashing when Israeli troops fired on them on March 23rd. The investigation found that due to poor night visibility the deputy battalion commander thought the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants. The medics' vehicles immediately came under fire, which lasted more than five minutes.

[Alternate URL here.] Last winter beekeepers across America "began reporting massive beehive collapses. More than half of the roughly 2.8 million colonies collapsed, costing the industry about $600 million in economic losses..." 

America's Department of Agriculture says "sublethal exposure" to pesticides remains one of the biggest factors threatening honeybees, according to the article — but it's one of several threats. "Parasites, loss of habitat, climate change and pesticides threaten to wipe out as much as 70% or more of the nation's honeybee colonies this year, potentially the most devastating loss that the nation has ever seen."


Some years are worse than others, but there has been a steady decline over time. Scientists have named the phenomenon colony collapse disorder: Bees simply disappear after they fly out to forage for pollen and nectar. Illness disables their radar, preventing them from finding their way home. The queen and her brood, if they survive, remain defenseless. 

The precise causes remain unknown. 
Bee colonies have become even more vulnerable because of the increase in extreme weather conditions, including droughts, heat waves, monster hurricanes, explosive wildfires and floods that have damaged or destroyed the bees and the vegetation they pollinate. If that isn't bad enough, parasites — and other creatures researchers refer to as "biotic" threats that prey on bees — proliferate when there is damage to ecosystems. 

All that means that the U.S. beekeeping industry has contracted by about 2.9% over the past five years, according to data collected by IBISWorld, a research firm. Annual loss rates have been increasing among all beekeepers over the past decade with the most significant colony collapses in commercial operations happening during the past five years.
 

The article notes that "compounding the troubles for the bee industry are recent federal cuts" proposed by DOGE to America's Department of Agriculture, "where researchers were studying ways to protect the nation's honeybees." And while federal policies like tariffs could make farming more expensive, "Beekeepers also often depend on immigrants to manage their hives and to help produce commercial honey..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ubuntu 6.06 (2006)</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1k3rsih/ubuntu_606_2006/</link><author>/u/HeitorMD2</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:29:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The movie mistake mystery from &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;</title><link>https://fxrant.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-movie-mistake-mystery-from-revenge.html</link><author>CharlesW</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:29:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The finale of James Cameron's epic "Aliens" (1986) features the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) getting severed in half, but still functioning enough to save Newt (Carrie Henn) from getting sucked into the vacuum of space. The action-packed scene features an absolutely wonderful accidental reveal of how the cut-in-half android was accomplished on the set:The amazing makeup effects applied to Henriksen's body covers the bottom half of his body which is hidden through a hole in the set. But in order to get that little bit of extra athletic stretch to grab Newt, Henriksen popped his body out of the hole a little too far, revealing the classic stage trick. However, I'd gather that 99% of the audience has never noticed this little reveal of stagecraft since our eyes are fixed on Newt on screen right, sliding toward the airlock, and not on the ground contact of Bishop's half-body, which had already been firmly established in the scene.Avoiding reflections of the crew appearing to camera is a constant struggle for filmmakers. In Steven Spielberg's first masterpiece "Duel" (1971), David (Dennis Weaver) gets into a phone booth to make a call, with the front glass face of the booth aimed directly at the camera, and if the audience's gaze drifted off of Weaver's face, they could catch a glimpse of the crew:In the reflection, we see a few crew members on screen left, the camera itself, and director Spielberg on the right (he's the one shuffling left and right, who lowers his head in the middle of the take). Again, like all the examples I'm providing in this article, hardly anyone would ever notice these moments. When a viewer catches these brief moments, the illusion of the movie is briefly broken, but for fans of the filmmaking process, it's a joyful reminder of the overall magic trick. The most intimate movie scene with only two characters in a desolate, isolated environment actually was created by dozens and dozens of crew members standing slightly out of frame.Look for another accidental 'crew caught on camera' moment in the reflection in a car window in the 'leave the gun, take the cannoli' scene from "The Godfather" (1972), one that very few people ever notice.Here's a super quick revealing mistake from "The Dark Knight" (2008) that is a true "you'll never see this in real time" moment:Although "The Dark Knight" example gives the audience a much clearer look at the camera operator, the focus puller(?) and the camera itself reflected in the interrogation room’s mirrors, the shot is a lot harder to see the crew members and equipment in real time due to the chaotic and energetic camera movement, as opposed to the locked off nature of the "Duel" example.Amazingly, many folks who watch that clip from the dramatic drowning sequence cannot consciously see the bit of filmmaking that literally blocks the actors in an intimate moment. This is my favorite example of a movie's incredible emotional power — the scene is so dramatic and intense that most viewers cannot consciously see a giant cloth wiping away water from the lens of the camera in the middle of a shot.Incidentally, some of these revealing mistakes are being erased from cinema history due to overzealous restoration projects — the process of “cleaning up” a film for newer formats like Blu-ray and 4K — which is deeply wrong. This is a much bigger topic on which I have very strong thoughts and the hottest of takes. Just look at what modern restorations have done to two of these revealing mistakes from "Goodfellas" and "Aliens":Painting out these movie mistakes as part of a restoration is wrong. What's in the movie is in the movie, and altering the movie to this extent is a form of revisionist history. Cinema is worse off when over-aggressive restorations alter the action within the frame. To me, this is equivalent to swapping out an actor's performance with a different take, or changing the music score during an action sequence, or replacing a puppet creature with a computer graphics version of the same creature decades after release.  Movies are  But I digress.Like I said at the start, movies are handmade, and that's true even in today's landscape where digital visual effects are a prominent part of filmmaking. In the same way that physical crews use physical tools to build sets, construct costumes and craft props, visual effects artists use digital tools to craft an image. And with the hand-made nature of any art form, the lack of clinical accuracy lends to its charm and sometimes offers an accidental peek behind the scenes of how the art was constructed.Every few years, a "Star Wars" revealing mistake bubbles up on the internet, one from the Mustafar sequence from Episode III, "Revenge of the Sith" (2005). But the bizarre moment in the single shot was not as easily explainable as the examples I've shown above.Being in the privileged position of currently working at Industrial Light & Magic, the visual effects company that made the visual effects for the movie (and having worked on that movie [and that sequence!]), I took it upon myself to try and solve the mystery.Please enjoy the story, written by Ian Kintzle, of how I investigated the mystery of the "Force Ghost" in "Revenge of the Sith", as it originally appeared in the Star Wars Celebration Program for Japan 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>End of USAID in Sudan causing mass starvation.</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/19/world/africa/sudan-usaid-famine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare</link><author>/u/Culinaryhermit</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:23:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fox News labels Kyiv a Russian city, Ukraine calls for &apos;apology and investigation&apos;</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-foreign-ministry-calls-out-fox-news-for-labeling-kyiv-a-russian-city/</link><author>/u/tyw7</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:13:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has called out Fox News for labeling Kyiv a "Russian city" during its news broadcast.During its coverage of Easter services on April 20, Fox News aired footage of religious services from around the world, including the service Russian President Vladimir Putin attended in Moscow. Simultaneously, the right-wing news network broadcast live images from Easter religious services in Kyiv, misidentifying the Ukrainian capital as a Russian city. The error reportedly remained on screen for 20 minutes. "If this was a mistake rather than a deliberate political statement, there should be an apology and an investigation into who made the mistake," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on April 20.Although he didn't mention them by name, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to also criticize Fox News at the end of a statement on April 20 in which he reported multiple Russian ceasefire violations across the front line since an Easter ceasefire was declared. "Instead of broadcasting religious service from Moscow, the focus should be on pressuring Moscow to genuinely commit to a full ceasefire," Zelensky wrote."We thank all the media, podcasters, bloggers, and everyone sharing the truth about what is happening."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/your-politeness-could-be-costly-for-openai/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 17:12:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to their models.” It was a seemingly random question posed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumped in to reply that typing those words has added up to “tens of millions […]]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukrainians&apos; views on Putin&apos;s &apos;Easter truce&apos; | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TsLCHqfzfM</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0TsLCHqfzfM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:58:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 'Easter truce' announced by Vladimir Putin didn't hold long.

The self-healing nature of the Kubernetes platform is one of its biggest benefits.
Let’s consider two pods: a Python application and a PostgreSQL database.The application starts very fast and eagerly tries to establish a connection to the database.
Meanwhile, the database is initializing itself with the provided data;
the connection fails.
The pod ends up in the  state.After a while, Kubernetes requests the application pod’s state.
Because it’s failed, it terminates it and starts a new pod.
At this point, two things can happen:
the database pod isn’t ready yet, and it’s back to square one or it’s ready, and the application finally connects.With the above probe, Kubernetes waits for an initial ten seconds before requesting the pod’s status.
If it fails, it waits for another ten seconds.
Rinse and repeat 30 times before it fails definitely.You may have noticed the HTTP  endpoint above.
Kubernetes offers two exclusive Probe configuration settings:
 or .
The former is suitable for web applications, while the latter is for other applications.
It implies we need to know which kind of container the pod contains and how to check its status, provided it can.
I’m no PostgreSQL expert, so I searched for a status check command.
The Bitnami Helm Chart looks like the following when applied:Note that the above is a simplification, as it gladly ignores the database name and an SSL certificate.The startup probe speeds things up compared to the default situation if you configure it properly.
You can set a long initial delay, and then shorter increments.
Yet, the more diverse the containers, the harder it gets to configure, as you need to be an expert in each of the underlying containers.It would be beneficial to look for alternatives.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is There a Greener Way to Produce Iron?</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/20/019256/is-there-a-greener-way-to-produce-iron?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Using electrochemistry, University of Oregon researchers have developed a way to make iron metal for steel production without burning fossil fuels..." the University of Oregon wrote last year. "Decarbonizing this step would do roughly as much to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as converting every gas-guzzling vehicle on the roads to electric... If scaled up, the process could help decarbonize one of the largest and most emissions-intensive industries worldwide," replacing carbon-spewing industrial blast furnaces. 

Paul Kempler, their research assistant chemistry professor, added "The reason we got excited about this chemistry, is that our reactants are two things that are very cheap: saltwater and iron oxide." And this week he announced that "We actually have a chemical principle, a sort of guiding design rule, that will teach us how to identify low-cost iron oxides that we could use in these reactors." 

"Those reactions conveniently also produce chlorine, a commercially valuable byproduct," writes SciTechDaily, in a new follow-up report this week:


In their latest study, the researchers focused on improving the process by identifying which types of iron oxides make the reaction more cost-effective, an essential step toward scaling the method for industrial use.... In lab tests, the difference was striking: "With the really porous particles, we can make iron really quickly on a small area," Goldman said. "The dense particles just can't achieve the same rate, so we're limited in how much iron we can make per square meter of electrodes...." 

To take their process beyond the lab, Kempler's lab is working with researchers in other fields. A collaboration with civil engineers at Oregon State University is helping them better understand what's needed for the product to work in real-world applications. And collaboration with an electrode manufacturing company is helping them address the logistical and scientific challenges of scaling up an electrochemical process. "I think what this work shows is that technology can meet the needs of an industrial society without being environmentally devastating," Goldman said. 

"We haven't solved all the problems yet, of course, but I think it's an example that serves as a nucleation point for a different way of thinking about what solutions look like. We can continue to have industry and technology and medicine, and we can do it in a way that's clean — and that's awesome!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I made a thing</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k3q6nh/i_made_a_thing/</link><author>/u/Same_Breakfast_695</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:18:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So the last couple of weeks I have been trying to reimplement Homebrew with rust, including some added concurrency and stuffs for better performance.

But why? Is it due to nutrition? The good weather? Or genetics? Scientists around the world are attempting to solve the mystery.

91-year-old Antonangelo leads a busy life. Every morning, he goes to milk his flock of sheep and later, turns that milk into cheese. "Work is my life, if I stop, I'll die,” says Antonangelo. Like many Sardinians in the mountain regions, he and his wife eat almost exclusively local produce. Their recipes for a long life are exercise and healthy food.

Giuseppino is already 100 years old and still manages most of the steep paths in his home village of Villagrande on foot. Is the strenuous hillside location the secret of his longevity? Giuseppino's family takes care of him, but he still lives alone in his flat and is bursting with energy. For him, a positive attitude and a sense of humor are key to a long life.

Despite a good deal of research, the secrets of the Blue Zones still haven’t been fully explained. But one study from the region does concludes that genetics play an important role in the first half of life. For 91-year-old Carolina, it’s clear that an intact family is a prerequisite for a long life. She has no intention of going into an old people's home. For her, the most important thing is for a mother to grow old with her children. And traditional food preparation is still one of her favorite pastimes.

Got spammed with fake newsletter signups? Learn how to protect your forms using double opt-in, CAPTCHA, and Cloudflare.I woke up to 200 new subscribers on the newsletter of my site, videiro.com. Had it finally happened? Did my site finally go viral?\
Sadly no. After checking the new subscribers, I noticed that none had verified their email addresses, not even one, that’s definitely not a confidence.\
After some quick research, I understood that I had indeed been spammed. But all the emails look legit. Here are some examples:kathyolynn@yahoo.com
lukeckins@gmail.com
dispatch@gonealinc.com
doug_fern@hotmail.com
After some initial research (entering the emails into haveibeenpwned), it looks like most of these email addresses have been in some kind of hack or breach.\
So what was happening? How can I prevent it in the future?\
Someone decided to use compromised email addresses to spam my form. Either to pollute my newsletter, to see how far they could go, or just because they can?When making anything publicly available on the internet, there will be spammers, there will be bots, and there will be people trying to hack it. That is why you should always be making it as secure as possible.\
It turns out that this kind of spam attack is more common than you think (especially since my blog’s newsletter also got spammed a couple of weeks later). Bots crawl the web and look for forms, usually newsletter or contact forms, and then start submitting “leaked” email addresses.\
But why? Here are some reasons I came up with:To pollute your email list (if this is a personal attack, which I don’t think it is in this case)To test the validity of the emails??To annoy the leaked email addresses owners by having them subscribed to thousands of newslettersTo annoy the website owner (me)I have a couple of solutions to this problem.Step 1: Enable Double Opt-inThe first and most important step is to make sure that all your newsletters are ‘double opt-in,’ meaning that the user has to confirm their email address before getting subscribed.\
On Listmonk (the newsletter software I am using), make sure that the list to which you are subscribing your users to is \
This means that even if your form gets spammed, you can just remove all the addresses that haven’t verified their email (after a couple of days/weeks).Step 2: Add Captcha or Cloudflare JS ChallengeThe second step I took was to enable some sort of captcha. Initially, I set up an HCaptcha via Listmonk. But I don’t think that is the best solution, as it’s kind of annoying. I am, however, using it for the videiro.com newsletter. If you're interested in how to do it, here’s how:Under , enable captcha and enter a hCaptcha.com API key (you will first have to sign up at hcaptcha.com)\
However, with this setup, if you are using custom forms (like the email subscription form below), the submission process will be kind of broken.\

Even if it were brand-new, much of it is outdated. The world is entering an age of electric vehicles, data centers, and smart technology, so grid modernization is necessary. However, with digitalization comes cyber threats. A robust security posture is vital for success.Grid Modernization Strengthens Critical InfrastructureElectrification is changing how people use the grid. Electric vehicle infrastructure, renewable energy sources, smart grid technologies, and virtual power plants are becoming prevalent. Modernizing aging analog electrical infrastructure in these ways expands access to electricity and reduces reliance on finite fossil fuels, increasing resiliency.\
As power demand surges and electrification evolves, cutting-edge, diverse technology integrations grow increasingly important. Sensors can identify and isolate faults, preventing blackouts. Smart meters can help citizens optimize energy efficiency, reducing resource waste and greenhouse gas emissions.Why Grid Modernization Is Essential in the Long TermModernization is vital because America’s electrical infrastructure is old. Most circuit breakers and transmission lines were  and 1970s, so they are approaching the end of their expected lifespans. As of 2025, various programs are dedicated to upgrading the grid.\
Until then, outdated equipment poses a cybersecurity risk. For instance, after , transformers begin to show signs of age. Age is a strong determinant of equipment failure. The older the unit is, the more vulnerable it is to tampering. Strengthening the nation’s cybersecurity posture may have to come before grid modernization.Why Cybersecurity Is Essential for Grid ModernizationSince power plants, substations, and transmission lines fall under the umbrella of critical infrastructure, strengthening them through grid modernization is important. Resilience is key for ensuring reliability during peak load and preventing extreme weather events from causing blackouts. However, these integrations could introduce cybersecurity risks.\
When power grids were mostly analog, local governments only had to worry about physical threats like vandalism and severe weather. Since  and cybercrime has evolved, they must consider ransomware, data theft, and distributed denial-of-service attacks.\
If a cybercriminal were to cause rolling blackouts or shut down the power grid entirely, untold damage could occur. Within the first few days, food in the fridge would spoil, businesses would close, public transportation would shut down, and cell towers would fail.\
Hospitals and police stations would use backup generators to keep the lights on. However, that is a temporary solution, and they would still be impacted indirectly. Unresponsive traffic lights and a loss of communication would disrupt emergency services.\
Widespread blackouts haven’t happened yet. However, that doesn’t mean an advanced threat group couldn’t cause them, especially since cyberthreats are becoming more frequent and severe.Are Current Cybersecurity Practices Enough?Whether or not current cybersecurity measures are enough to protect power infrastructure during grid modernization is the question on experts’ minds. Even though government agencies are working hard to create a robust, tamperproof system, cyberthreats are evolving rapidly.\
As digitalization progresses, novel attacks targeting electrical infrastructure are emerging. For instance, a cybercriminal could use a software-defined radio  to wirelessly abort a vehicle’s charging session from over 155 feet away. Alternatively, they could tamper with Wi-Fi to rope home charging stations into a malicious botnet.What Security Mechanisms Protect the Power Grid?To be fair, various government agencies have recognized the importance of grid security and have stepped up. For instance, the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER) is leading the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) efforts to strengthen security and resilience.\
As cyberthreats targeting power systems evolve, CESER  and development and deploys cutting-edge technologies. Facilitating information sharing helps other agencies develop cybersecurity architectures, automate attack prevention, and address gaps in smart electrical interfaces.\
The U.S. DOE’s cybersecurity-by-design approach uses tools like authentication mechanisms and data encryption to strengthen systems, even if there are wide security gaps between legacy and modern grid components.Emerging Technologies Could Strengthen SecurityVarious government agencies spend tens of millions of dollars upgrading the power grid’s safety and resilience with cutting-edge security measures. Will those defenses be enough when cybercriminals can deploy next-generation technologies like malicious machine learning models?\
Despite significant investments, the country’s energy infrastructure is still outdated, making it vulnerable. In 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. found that the number of susceptible points among U.S. electrical networks  per day. Long-term plans to improve security posture are essential, but may not be enough in the short term.\
Deploying artificial intelligence for automatic threat detection would be a huge step forward. Hyperconverged infrastructure should be another consideration. This software-centric information technology (IT) setup combines servers, data storage, and networking components in a distributed platform, simplifying management, monitoring, and maintenance.Fixing the Gaps Between Legacy and Modern SystemsBefore the government can modernize electrical infrastructure, it must strengthen the grid’s security posture. However, since implementing new cybersecurity mechanisms could introduce vulnerabilities, proactive security interventions are essential.\
No matter how IT professionals upgrade energy infrastructure, gaps between legacy and modern technologies are very likely. Replacing everything from transmission lines to control systems simultaneously simply isn’t feasible, so they may face compatibility or technical issues. Informed decision-making is key to preventing unexpected vulnerabilities during this period.\
Decision-makers should also consider which implementation plan produces the fewest security vulnerabilities. Would it be better to upgrade control systems before installing vehicle charging stations? Do transmission lines and circuit breakers need internet-enabled sensors for monitoring, or would that only introduce new risks?Grid Modernization Only Succeeds With CybersecurityCybersecurity professionals — especially those at the U.S. DOE and CESER — know how important securing the nation’s power grid is. They are actively working on improvements. However, the specifics about what to implement and when to upgrade are somewhat of a gray area. As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, so must their tactics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQUc6S1-4so</link><author>Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/UQUc6S1-4so?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:59:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTHx0ObkFZ97KO2SWUuz9w">Shawn Grenier | The Canvas</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[My video on Sylvia Sleigh:

("After eight years of dedication to the ArcoLinux project and the broader Linux community...") 

'Learn, have fun, and enjoy' was our motto for the past eight years — and I really had fun doing all this," Dubois says in a video version of his farewell post. "And if we reflect back on this teaching and the building and promoting of Linux, it was fun. But the time has come for me to step away..." 

Over its eight years ArcoLinux "accomplished several important milestones," reports Linux magazine, "such as creating over 5,000 educational videos; the creation of ArcoInstall; the Carli education project; the Arch Linux Calamares Installer (ALCI); the ArcoPlasma, ArcoNet, ArcroPro, and Ariser variants; and much more."
According to Dubois, they weren't just creating a distribution but a mindset. 

Dubois says that the code will remain online so others can learn from, fork, or remix the distro. He also indicated that ArcoLinux will supply users with a transition package to help them convert their existing ArcoLinux systems to Arch Linux. That package will remove ArcoLinux branding, replace pacman.conf with an Arch and Chaotic-AUR focused config file, and change the arcolinux-mirrorlist to a single source.
 

 It's FOSS News describes ArcoLinux as one of those "user-friendly Arch-based distros that give you a bleeding-edge experience."
The reasoning behind this move, as shared by Erik, is his advancing age and him realizing that he doesn't have the same level of mental focus or stamina he used to have before. He has found himself making small mistakes, the kind that can negatively affect a major undertaking like this... Come July 1, 2025, the transition period will end, marking a stop to all development, including the deactivation of the ArcoLinux social media handles. The Telegram and Discord communities will stay a bit longer but will close up eventually. 
"I want to leave ArcoLinux while it's still strong, and while I can look back with pride at everything we've accomplished together," Dubois says in their post...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>15 Reasons I Love Go</title><link>https://appliedgo.net/why-go/</link><author>/u/ChristophBerger</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:26:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go became known for its built-in concurrency and the absence of inheritance. But Go has many more advantages than these. I collected 15 of them here. Each of them might not seem world-shaking when looked at in isolation, but taken together, they build a unique composition of features that make Go the language we Gophers could love to pieces.Use these reasons as a decision aid. They are unbiased, guaranteed! ;)Go's simplicity and lightweight syntax make it an easy language to learn and adopt, especially for newer programmers.Unlike some languages, Go avoids complex features and minimizes bells and whistles. Developing in Go feels like a breath of fresh air, enabling you to focus on solving problems rather than wrestling with the language itself.Go's simplicity and “boringness” make it the language of choice for mixed teams. Quoting Jonathan Hall, “I can take a group of juniors and seniors and put them together, and they can be productive together, without having to spend months ramping up the juniors to understand all the arcane syntax in a language.”If you're looking for a modern language that gets out of your way, Go is your choice.One of Go's standout features is its unbelievably fast compiler. We're talking seconds for even large codebases.This super quick feedback loop improves developer productivity tremendously. You don't waste precious time waiting for bloated builds. Instead, you can iterate rapidly and use the time saved to add more value to your programs. It's almost like using an interpreted language.For this reason alone, Go is worth adopting if you value fast development speed.3. Go collects your garbageGo's built-in garbage collection eliminates the need for manual memory management, making Go far easier to program than languages like C and C++.As a developer, you don't have to worry about freeing memory or tracking allocations. The garbage collector handles all of that for you efficiently and without pause. Programming in Go feels like a relief, knowing you can focus on high-level app logic rather than nitty-gritty memory details.This simplicity is one reason Go is loved by so many developers today!4. Concurrency made easierConcurrency is baked into Go, unlike many other languages.Goroutines and channels make it substantially easier to write asynchronous code that fully utilize multicore processors. Go uses a model called CSP that makes concurrency much easier to reason about. Concurrency is the future as Moore's Law ends, and Go makes it more approachable.If you need to build high-performance backends and systems, Go's excellent concurrency support is a must-have feature.Go was designed from day one for scalability.Its hyper-lightweight threads (a.k.a. goroutines) and built-in concurrency features allow Go programs to take advantage of multicore CPUs and distributed computing clusters. Go handles all the scheduling of goroutines behind the scenes, enabling you to focus on your program's logic and architecture.Some of the world's most demanding and highest-traffic systems are built with Go, including Docker, Kubernetes, CloudFlare, and Dropbox. If you need scalability, check out Go!Go is a statically typed language like Java or C++.This means that variables have a fixed type known at compile time, rather than changing dynamically like in Python. Static typing catches errors earlier in the dev process and improves runtime performance since types don't need to be checked at runtime.Moreover, static typing means better self-documentation. And Go's type inference keeps the syntax simple. You get safety and speed without the verbosity.For any large program, static typing is a must-have feature.Go ships with a robust standard library, so you can be productive right away.The standard library provides high-quality implementations for things like HTTP servers, JSON parsing, cryptography, and more.No need for stitching together external libraries or reinventing the wheel. The standard library is cross-platform and has bindings for Windows and Linux systems programming.Whether building a web app, utility, or system tool, you can get quite far with Go's standard library.Even though Go is garbage collected, it provides low-level access to memory and pointers like C for high-performance use cases.You can pass pointers to avoid copying data and write superfast programs that run closer to the metal.Go gives you the control when you need it. Unlike many managed languages, Go recognizes that sometimes you require expressive low-level access to memory and internals for the hottest code paths.Go helps write your code with sympathy for the underlying platform to extract the highest performance.9. Interfaces over inheritanceInterfaces in Go provide powerful polymorphism and abstraction capabilities.You can hide concrete implementation details behind simple interfaces. Types in Go implicitly satisfy interfaces by implementing the required methods. This enables loose coupling between components.Interfaces are everywhere in Go - , , and more, are part of the standard library and help abstract away technical details. They are a key part of idiomatic Go code to decouple software elements and enable clean architecture and design.Unlike some languages, Go compiles down to static machine code rather than bytecode or being purely interpreted.This means you can trivially build Go programs for many platforms like Linux, macOS, and Windows. There's no need for virtual machines or interpreters. The compiled executables can be linked into C programs too.Go's cross-platform abilities make deploying and shipping software simple. A binary with no dependencies can run anywhere. Cross-compilation even allows compiling a binary on Windows for Linux, or on Linux for BSD, or on macOS for Windows, without the need for installing toolchains of the target platform. That's a massive advantage for ops and infrastructure management.I love Go's toolchain. It is fairly complete and well-thought-out, and it significantly improves the development experience as a whole, as well as in small details.For example, the built-in formatting tool  automatically styles your code consistently. No more arguing over tabs versus spaces, or the placement of curlies!Dependency management, testing, benchmarking, profiling, and more, are built-in features.The Go toolchain is a one-stop shop for all development tooling requirements. It integrates seamlessly into your development flow, so you can focus on programming rather than setup.12. Built-in testing and benchmarkingTesting and benchmarking are built right into Go with the go test command.Writing unit tests in Go is easy and idiomatic. The testing package provides everything you need for basic tests up to complex mocked objects and code coverage reporting. No need for learning a new domain language: Go tests are written in plain Go.By making testing ergonomic, Go supports development practices like Test-Driven Design (TDD). And the benchmarking tools allow comparing different versions of your code for performance.With Go, continuous unit testing quickly becomes second nature to you, leading to more confidence in your code and much fewer regressions.13. A thriving open-source ecosystemGo has a thriving open-source ecosystem with high-quality packages for nearly any need.The rich standard library provides the foundations, but Go's package ecosystem adds incredible value on top.Packages like Gin or Echo for web frameworks, sqlc, jet, bob, Ent, or GORM for database access, and Go SDKs for countless public APIs give you ready-made building blocks for the task at your hand. Sharing and discovery are easy with the central package repository at pkg.go.dev. And Go's package management handles dependencies seamlessly.Bottom line: Go's fantastic community and ecosystem make development productive and enjoyable.The language and standard library are carefully evolved between releases. New versions of Go work with older codebases seamlessly in nearly all cases. You can update to the latest Go confident your software will compile and run without issue.Backward compatibility enables a stable base to build on. Technical debt and rewrite costs are avoided. Compared to other languages, Go takes compatibility seriously to support long-term projects. Knowing your code will continue working with new Go releases is a weight off your shoulders.And it gets even better. Since Go 1.21, modules can request to be compiled with a particular version of the Go toolchain, and the installed Go command will happily download and use that toolchain. This is a level of backward and forward compatibility other languages can only dream of.All dependencies of a build are fully determined. No dependency can change unless explicitly updated in the  file. Moreover, the Go Sum database guarantees that module versions are immutable, making it impossible to inject modified code into an existing version. Finally, Go doesn't allow dependencies to execute code during builds, limiting the attack surface significantly.With these measures in place, and considering other security-friendly features of Go such as static linking, focus on clear code, static typing, and a rich standard library that reduces the need for using external modules, Go is an obvious choice for security-aware projects.It took only three of these properties to have me sold on Go: The clear syntax and semantics, concurrency, and the fast compiler. I quickly learned to know and admire the rest of these properties during my first steps in Go. So even if you can only check off three of these properties as relevant for you, give Go a try.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Rust compiler (1.77.0 to 1.85.0) reserves 2x extra stack for large enum?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k3ouyq/why_rust_compiler_1770_to_1850_reserves_2x_extra/</link><author>/u/Helpful_Garbage_7242</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 15:18:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Almost a year ago I found an interesting case with Rust compiler version <= 1.74.0 reserving stack larger than needed to model Result type with boxed error, the details are available here - Rust: enum, boxed error and stack size mystery.

This potential action comes as pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán faces his most serious political challenge in years from opposition leader Péter Magyar.Russian President Putin’s ally Orbán has opposed military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion, pushing for peace talks that would freeze the war and solidify Moscow’s control of occupied territories. Posters are appearing throughout Hungary with the slogan “Let’s not allow them to decide for us,” featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European People’s Party leader Manfred Weber as villains in Hungarian government propaganda, The Guardian says.The campaign centers on a referendum asking citizens: “Do you support Ukraine becoming a member of the EU?” After launching the campaign, PM Orbán urged citizens to vote against membership, claiming that “we would have to spend all Hungary’s money on Ukraine.” The government has also made unsubstantiated claims that “” from Ukraine would take Hungarian jobs and that epidemics would spread due to insufficient vaccination rates among Ukrainians.László Andor, Hungary’s EU commissioner from 2010 to 2014, told The Guardian that the governing Fidesz party recognized “there is a sentiment against Hungary’s involvement in the war” and has “” this sentiment “to deny proper support to Ukraine.”Voting ban considerationsNot only has Hungary under Orbán never sent military aid to Ukraine, but рфі also vetoed the release of €6 billion in funds meant to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and has refused to sign two EU declarations supporting its invaded neighbor. Moreover, Budapest has repeatedly attempted to block EU sanctions against Russia, although it eventually backed down.Hungary’s behavior has intensified discussions among EU countries about invoking Article 7, the treaty mechanism that could suspend its voting rights.Any such move, however, faces a major hurdle: unanimous backing from the other 26 member states. That level of agreement has proven elusive in the past, with Poland previously blocking action. Attention has now turned to Slovakia, where Prime Minister Robert Fico is seen as the most likely to shield Hungary from potential penalties.A potential flashpoint is approaching on 31 July, when Hungary could block the renewal of EU sanctions against Russia. The package includes the freeze on €210 billion in Russian central bank assets, with profits helping to finance Ukraine’s defense and the principal seen as vital for future reconstruction.While Hungary has a history of retreating from such veto threats, diplomats remain cautious.“If the past is predictive for the future, we should be OK. But it would be foolish to assume that,” one senior diplomat told The Guardian, noting that contingency plans are already in motion to circumvent a possible Hungarian block.Dutch Green MEP Tineke Strik, who leads the European Parliament’s efforts on Hungary and rule-of-law matters, told The Guardian:“Member states really are getting fed up with Orbán.”According to her, 19 governments appear willing to advance the Article 7 process, even if only through measures that stop short of suspending voting rights. However, she noted a key obstacle remains: they still lack “a strategy on how to get the rest of the member states on board.”Last week, Strik led a cross-party delegation that found Hungary’s democratic standards were “going rapidly in the wrong direction.” The forthcoming report will highlight state-controlled media, politicized courts, and rising LGBTQ+ restrictions, including a constitutional Pride ban.You could close this page.

Pinpointing when and where Earth's hydrogen is an essential key to understanding how life arose on the planet. Without hydrogen, there's no water, and without water, life can't exist here. Ironically, researchers turned to a meteorite containing hydrogen to prove that such former bodies did not provide the H2 ingredient of water's H2O recipe. They examined a rare type of meteorite — known as an enstatite chondrite — that was built similarly to early Earth 4.5 billion years ago and the team discovered hydrogen present in the chemical. The logic is that if this material resembling early Earth's composition can contain hydrogen, so too could the young planet.... 


Since the proto-Earth was made of material similar to enstatite chondrites, by the time the immature planet had grown large enough to be struck by asteroids, it would have already stashed enough hydrogen to explain Earth's present-day water supply.Although this study likely won't resolve the debate over Earth's original water source, it tilts the ta ble toward an internal, not external one. "We now think that the material that built our planet — which we can study using these rare meteorites — was far richer in hydrogen than we thought previously," James Bryson, an Oxford professor and an author of the paper, said in a press release. "This finding supports the idea that the formation of water on Earth was a natural process, rather than a fluke of hydrated asteroids bombarding our planet after it formed."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chinese ambassador warns US not to repeat tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era</title><link>https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3307223/chinese-ambassador-warns-us-not-repeat-tariff-mistakes-great-depression-era?module=top_story&amp;amp;pgtype=homepage</link><author>/u/Saltedline</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 14:31:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[China’s ambassador to the United States Xie Feng has said that the United States should avoid the mistakes from the Great Depression of the 1930s amid the escalating tariff war between the two countries.Xie was speaking at a Traditional Chinese Medicine open-day event at the embassy in Washington, but he drew on ancient lore as a metaphor for the current trade dispute.He cited the philosophy of addressing causes rather than just symptoms, calling for joint efforts to grow the global economy rather than fighting over the existing spoils.“You can’t just treat a headache by just focusing on the head or foot pain by only targeting the feet,” Xie said. “And you certainly shouldn’t prescribe medicine to others when you’re the one who’s sick.”More specifically, he cited the lessons from US protectionist policies – including the tariff-heavy Smoot-Hawley Act, which is widely accepted to have worsened the Great Depression and is now used as cautionary tale by economic historians.“The lesson of the Smoot-Hawley Act is still fresh today,” Xie said.The Act was designed to protect US agriculture and manufacturing and imposed tariffs of between 59 and 75 per cent on some imported goods such as car parts and wool, but it led to a dramatic fall in global trade that helped prolong the Great Depression.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why is OpenAI buying Windsurf?</title><link>https://theahura.substack.com/p/tech-things-openai-buys-windsurf</link><author>theahura</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 14:28:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Built a simple UI tool for node group-level observability in AWS EKS — KubePeek</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1k3nas5/built_a_simple_ui_tool_for_node_grouplevel/</link><author>/u/captain_sangam</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 14:06:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey folks!

I would often come across a post on /r/unixporn that inspired me to try to customize the look and feel of my desktop environment. So I would install Xfce, LXQt or Sway and try to recreate components that I like from other users or create my own. I would end up installing different kinds of panels, plugins, docks and launchers as well as random themes, fonts and sounds.A portion of this process would be documented, initially as random shell scripts in my home directory, before graduating to Ansible playbooks – with a brief detour into Nix that I will not elaborate on. Some of the customizations would live in my home directory, but there were often system-wide modifications to  required.Eventually, the constant churn and randomly broken desktop components such as a panel that mysteriously vanished or a non-functional dock led me to stick with the stock configuration of whatever desktop environment I was using at the time.
The major desktop environments, KDE Plasma and GNOME, are both well polished and great out of the box. The desktop experience that they have delivered over the last few years has contributed to desktop Linux being the best it has ever been, in my opinion.But the itch to customize and tweak my desktop environment in fun and interesting ways is still there. Eventually, I was introduced to the concept of bootable containers.Bootc As A Themer’s Playground⌗Once written, you can build the container locally and instruct your bootc-aware system to use the new image.After a reboot, the system’s deployment is defined by the new container.With Fedora Atomic systems,  is mounted read-only and because your operating system is defined by an OCI container, it is incredibly easy to revert to a previous tag of that container. I can easily create a throwaway container where I test out ideas for a theme, reboot into the new deployment and test it out on bare-metal. I can roll back to the previous container if necessary or create a new container with follow-up modifications.One downside is that this reboot-heavy workflow can obviously cause some friction. This can be mitigated somewhat by enabling “Development Mode” with , which creates a temporary writable overlayfs on top of . I often find myself using this mode to temporarily install some package, theme or configuration in . After verifying that it works as expected, I can add that functionality to the Containerfile. If it doesn’t work, I can either reboot to get rid of the changes, or (more likely) just forget about the change and it will remove itself whenever I reboot normally. The lack of cruft that accumulates over time in a typical Linux installation is one of the major advantages of this approach.Of course, there are other ways to achieve similar results without using a bootable container model:You can write shell scripts or Ansible playbooks and hope that they accurately capture changes to the system so that they can be reliably undone. Typically, configuration drift that occurs as software gets updated is not addressed.With systemd-sysext(8), you can create a squashfs image of a filesystem containing your theming changes for  and overlay it on top of the root filesystem. An ecosystem around how these images should be created, maintained, deployed and updated has yet to emerge.You can inscribe your custom theming as runes in an arcane and inscrutable functional language known only to the elders as N̸̘̏͑̕͝į̸̈́̂x̸͙̑̅̒.In my opinion, none of the alternatives provide the same level of flexibility and tooling support as writing a Dockerfile, nor can they achieve bootc’s level of safety and reliability by making it extremely difficult to bork your  directory. And if the  directory somehow gets borked anyway, rolling back to the previously deployed container is just a reboot away.A few weeks ago, an OCI image based on Fedora Xfce Atomic that I made called Blue95 was posted to Hacker News. For the most part, the reception was warm but there were some interesting questions that were raised, such as:Is it really necessary to spin up an entirely new distro for an XFCE+GTK theme?The original poster made me question the nature of the project I created: is it a distro? In the age of bootc, the distinction between what is considered a Linux distribution and what is simply a Containerfile + CI/CD is, in my opinion, murky at best. Historically, the barrier to entry for creating what has traditionally been called a Linux distribution was orders of magnitude higher than creating and publishing an OCI container. My nights-and-weekends side project of building a bootable container is a far cry from what I imagine a Linux distribution to be.Blue95 is a collection of scripts and YAML files cobbled together to produce a Containerfile, which is built via GitHub Actions and published to the GitHub Container Registry. Which part of this process elevates the project to the status of a Linux distribution? What set of  commands in the Containerfile take the project from being merely a Fedora-based OCI image to a full-blown Linux distribution?Popular bootc-based projects like Project Bluefin and Bazzite are often labeled as Linux distributions, much to the consternation of their creators and maintainers. But if you’ve ever used Bazzite and booted directly into Steam’s Big Picture Mode, you might agree that it does indeed feel like its own Linux distribution; it is quite distinct from its twin bases of Fedora Silverblue and Fedora Kinoite.Maybe the imprecision of the term “Linux distribution” is most evident when arguments arise over what is and isn’t a distro. It has always been problematic to define a distribution as simply a curated collection of software plus a Linux kernel -— but that definition is now especially lacking, as it could just as easily describe any Containerfile for a bootable container. Ultimately, “I know it when I see it” may be the best we can do when deciding whether a project deserves the label Linux distribution or not.Finally, to address the original question about the necessity of spinning up a new distro just for a theme: creating a bootable container with a consistent visual design and curated set of applications can bring a bit of . At this moment, my laptop is booted from a container that I have created myself. The operating system being used to draft these words is the product of my own artistic and creative expression – built on the work of countless other human beings. And that brings me joy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis emerges from convalescence on Easter, delights crowd with popemobile tour</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQGHgUdVdpU</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sQGHgUdVdpU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:40:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis emerged from his convalescence on Easter Sunday to bless the thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square and treat them to a surprise popemobile tour through the piazza, drawing wild cheers and applause as he continues his recovery from a near-fatal bout of double pneumonia.

This part will focus on why I think it is an important improvement over the git's status-quo and why I use it daily.Let's start by defining the aforementioned status-quo. Typical user sees interaction with Git as moving files between 3 stages:Files are edited in the file system. Git doesn't know anything about them. Some of the commands can compare the changed parts against other stages (think  or ).Some [parts] of the files are added to the "staging area" using  command. These changes are not yet part of the tracked history, but Git knows about them.Proper content-snapshot with identifier and metadata is injected into the repository using  command.Linus called this system "the stupid content tracker" because at its core it doesn't try to do anything smart. It doesn't try to understand the content, it doesn't try to understand the changes, it doesn't try to understand the history. It just stores the snapshots and the metadata. In the grand scheme of things, it is up to the user to make sense of it. And to be effective with git, users  to make sense of it.Jujutsu, a VCS which I started to use recently, makes some very different choices. Let's see how it handles this. I will be talking about the concepts and showing the commands. If you want to follow along, you can install it and try it out in parallel.On macOS with Homebrew it is as simple as . You can find instructions for other platforms on the official site.Jujutsu allows you to work with arbitrary git repositories. You can use both  and  at the same time. Adding jujutsu support to repo is as simple as running  in it. Jujutsu will detect existing git repository and will configure itself to transparently sync with it.Jujutsu has plans to provide several opensource backend implementations: git-based one and the native one. Google has a backend powered by Piper, their internal VCS system, but it is not public. Native backend is not ready yet, and while it will have some interesting properties, for now it is not a practical topic. The rest of this post would be talking only about git-backend.Everything's a part of "change"Git, as I shown above, expects user to work on files and then to "commit" their snapshot to the repository. Thus, the verb became a noun and we say that Git-repository stores commits.Jujutsu uses a different terminology: repository stores changes. At any point in time, whenever you edit, add or remove a file, these modifications become a part of the "current change". You never need to commit them explicitly.As soon as we connected jj to the repository it has created a new  change with . We can check this by running  (or ) command. is an id of the change. it would remain static no matter how we change the contents in the future. is a content-hash which corresponds to the id of the git commit. As soon as we add a single new letter to the files it will change. means that this change is allocated, but it doesn't have any content yet. Again, as soon as we modify a single letter in files, this marker will disappear. means that we didn't bother to set the description of the change yet (it corresponds to the "commit message" in git).Jujutsu doesn't require you to set descriptions of changes until you want to make them public. In Jujutsu it is perfectly fine to have multiple non-described changes. I still prefer to set descriptions early on, but it is not a requirement.The command to set the description is . This command does not create a new change. It modifies the description of current change. You can call it several times and it will be modifying description of the same change.How do you start a new change? Well, you just use  for that.Branches don't have namesLet's take a look at the log of our changes. We'll use  for that.The thing I'd like to focus on is the  marker, which stayed at exactly the same place where it was in this git repository initially. Branches in jujutsu do not have names, which might be contra-intuitive at first. Previously, we created a single branch of changes starting from git's "main" branch, but we can create more like this:  and they wouldn't be lost, as Jujutsu's log would give us access to all of them without any issues. Strictly speaking, this is exactly what was done as part of  under the hood: it created one empty change for us automatically.And, as we can create multiple independent branches of changes from any point of the tree, Jujutsu can not meaningfully make assumptions about moving the marker.In previous paragraphs I said "marker", but the proper Jujutsu term for this is "bookmark". Literally, the "main" is a bookmark in tree, which can be referenced by name, and moved as we need (just as we move a bookmark, when we read the book).So, whenever we're ready to tell: "this is, what everyone should consider  from now on!", we just type jj bookmark move main --to=@. At this moment, git's "main" branch would start to point at this commit ("current" commit has special id ) and the whole branch would become visible to the git. Other branches we created would be mostly hidden from git tools (but the commits would still be stored in git's repository).The next step would be able to push the  to the upstream repository (such as github) using  command. Except that we still have some undescribed changes. It is not prohibited to have that in git, but it would definitely look strange. Let's play nice and that.One way to do it is to use . A lot of jj's commands accept  argument which allows to specify the change-id, which is the target of command. In this case, change-id is , but we can use  as it was hilighted in the log. Jujutsu always highlights shortest non-ambiguous prefix of the change-id in the log.Another approach is more generic. We can use  to resume work on the change and just call  without arguments while we do it.Whether we modify the description or the contents of the change it's content-hash would change, but it's change-id would not. And, as descendent commits are linked via change-ids and bookmarks are attached to change-ids as well, the branch would maintain it's shape after the changes. So, now we should finally be able to push our changes.Editing pre-existing changes of the upstream branch and pushing them to git again would result in a force-push. From Git's point of view these new commits are not connected to the old ones and history rewriting happens.Jujutsu uses several heuristics to prevent "dangerous" situations such as "moving" the branch which was already merged into something else, but overall it is much more forgiving in this regard.In cases when several people work on the same branch such pushes would result in the need to re-sync local branches. In the future, when we have forges with native jujutsu support, these operations would be trivial and boring (in a good way).In the previous section we were modifying the change in the middle of the branch. How would Jujutsu react if we introduced the conflict? Let's check!You see that the upper change is marked with a red "conflict" word now, but Jujutsu still allows us to work on whatever we want. It doesn't force us to resolve conflict now. The most interesting part is, that we do not have to resolve the conflict at the point where it was introduced.I'll create a new change at the top of the branch:  and will edit the code to resolve the conflict there. Take a look at the log now:We have intermediate change in "conflicted" state, but above it the branch is clean again. And we could leave it at that, but let's apply the fix to the broken change instead to get a clean history. We will use  command for that: gathers the modifications from the current change and makes them a part of the specified change instead. Done. Conflict is gone. New empty change is automatically created for us. We can continue working on the branch. without  argument applies modifications to the parent change. It can be used to emulate a staging area of git. The basic idea is that you keep the parts which you're sure about in one change and experimental modifications in the next one. And as soon as you're sure in the quality of your experimental code you squash it into the proper change. A lot of people consider this to be the recommended flow for Jujutsu.Until this point I was talking about linear changes and diverging branches, but nothing about merges. Two reasons: a). I wanted to lay the groundwork; b). There isn't much to talk about :)In Jujutsu, one doesn't make a merge of branches. Instead, one makes a change with several parents: , where , etc. are either change-ids or branch-names (or some other interesting things we did not talk about yet).Resulting change would reside on it's own anonymous branch, as usually and you'll need to assign some bookmark to it to make it visible in git.Thus, equivalent of  would look like this:It is more verbose, but gives you more control over the process.I hope I managed to spark your interest in jujutsu. This post is definitely not an exhaustive guide, but I wanted to give you a taste of what it is like to work with it.If you want to learn more, I encourage you to check out:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JD Vance meets Pope Francis at Vatican on Easter Sunday</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0PfM3spPU8</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/D0PfM3spPU8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 13:25:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Vatican said they met for a few minutes at the Domus Santa Marta "to exchange Easter greetings."

This potential action comes as pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán faces his most serious political challenge in years from opposition leader Péter Magyar.Russian President Putin’s ally Orbán has opposed military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion, pushing for peace talks that would freeze the war and solidify Moscow’s control of occupied territories. Posters are appearing throughout Hungary with the slogan “Let’s not allow them to decide for us,” featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and European People’s Party leader Manfred Weber as villains in Hungarian government propaganda, The Guardian says.The campaign centers on a referendum asking citizens: “Do you support Ukraine becoming a member of the EU?” After launching the campaign, PM Orbán urged citizens to vote against membership, claiming that “we would have to spend all Hungary’s money on Ukraine.” The government has also made unsubstantiated claims that “” from Ukraine would take Hungarian jobs and that epidemics would spread due to insufficient vaccination rates among Ukrainians.László Andor, Hungary’s EU commissioner from 2010 to 2014, told The Guardian that the governing Fidesz party recognized “there is a sentiment against Hungary’s involvement in the war” and has “” this sentiment “to deny proper support to Ukraine.”Voting ban considerationsNot only has Hungary under Orbán never sent military aid to Ukraine, but рфі also vetoed the release of €6 billion in funds meant to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and has refused to sign two EU declarations supporting its invaded neighbor. Moreover, Budapest has repeatedly attempted to block EU sanctions against Russia, although it eventually backed down.Hungary’s behavior has intensified discussions among EU countries about invoking Article 7, the treaty mechanism that could suspend its voting rights.Any such move, however, faces a major hurdle: unanimous backing from the other 26 member states. That level of agreement has proven elusive in the past, with Poland previously blocking action. Attention has now turned to Slovakia, where Prime Minister Robert Fico is seen as the most likely to shield Hungary from potential penalties.A potential flashpoint is approaching on 31 July, when Hungary could block the renewal of EU sanctions against Russia. The package includes the freeze on €210 billion in Russian central bank assets, with profits helping to finance Ukraine’s defense and the principal seen as vital for future reconstruction.While Hungary has a history of retreating from such veto threats, diplomats remain cautious.“If the past is predictive for the future, we should be OK. But it would be foolish to assume that,” one senior diplomat told The Guardian, noting that contingency plans are already in motion to circumvent a possible Hungarian block.Dutch Green MEP Tineke Strik, who leads the European Parliament’s efforts on Hungary and rule-of-law matters, told The Guardian:“Member states really are getting fed up with Orbán.”According to her, 19 governments appear willing to advance the Article 7 process, even if only through measures that stop short of suspending voting rights. However, she noted a key obstacle remains: they still lack “a strategy on how to get the rest of the member states on board.”Last week, Strik led a cross-party delegation that found Hungary’s democratic standards were “going rapidly in the wrong direction.” The forthcoming report will highlight state-controlled media, politicized courts, and rising LGBTQ+ restrictions, including a constitutional Pride ban.You could close this page.

Delivering state-of-the-art performance, Gemma 3 quickly established itself as a leading model capable of running on a single high-end GPU like the NVIDIA H100 using its native BFloat16 (BF16) precision.To make Gemma 3 even more accessible, we are announcing new versions optimized with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) that dramatically reduces memory requirements while maintaining high quality. This enables you to run powerful models like Gemma 3 27B locally on consumer-grade GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090.Understanding performance, precision, and quantizationThe chart above shows the performance (Elo score) of recently released large language models. Higher bars mean better performance in comparisons as rated by humans viewing side-by-side responses from two anonymous models. Below each bar, we indicate the estimated number of NVIDIA H100 GPUs needed to run that model using the BF16 data type.Why BFloat16 for this comparison? BF16 is a common numerical format used during inference of many large models. It means that the model parameters are represented with 16 bits of precision. Using BF16 for all models helps us to make an apples-to-apples comparison of models in a common inference setup. This allows us to compare the inherent capabilities of the models themselves, removing variables like different hardware or optimization techniques like quantization, which we'll discuss next.It's important to note that while this chart uses BF16 for a fair comparison, deploying the very largest models often involves using lower-precision formats like FP8 as a practical necessity to reduce immense hardware requirements (like the number of GPUs), potentially accepting a performance trade-off for feasibility.The Need for AccessibilityWhile top performance on high-end hardware is great for cloud deployments and research, we heard you loud and clear: you want the power of Gemma 3 on the hardware you already own. We're committed to making powerful AI accessible, and that means enabling efficient performance on the consumer-grade GPUs found in desktops, laptops, and even phones.Performance Meets Accessibility with Quantization-Aware Training in Gemma 3This is where quantization comes in. In AI models, quantization reduces the precision of the numbers (the model's parameters) it stores and uses to calculate responses. Think of quantization like compressing an image by reducing the number of colors it uses. Instead of using 16 bits per number (BFloat16), we can use fewer bits, like 8 (int8) or even 4 (int4).Using int4 means each number is represented using only 4 bits – a 4x reduction in data size compared to BF16. Quantization can often lead to performance degradation, so we’re excited to release Gemma 3 models that are robust to quantization. We released several quantized variants for each Gemma 3 model to enable inference with your favorite inference engine, such as Q4_0 (a common quantization format) for Ollama, llama.cpp, and MLX.How do we maintain quality? We use QAT. Instead of just quantizing the model after it's fully trained, QAT incorporates the quantization process during training. QAT simulates low-precision operations during training to allow quantization with less degradation afterwards for smaller, faster models while maintaining accuracy. Diving deeper, we applied QAT on ~5,000 steps using probabilities from the non-quantized checkpoint as targets. We reduce the perplexity drop by 54% (using llama.cpp perplexity evaluation) when quantizing down to Q4_0.See the Difference: Massive VRAM SavingsThe impact of int4 quantization is dramatic. Look at the VRAM (GPU memory) required just to load the model weights: Drops from 54 GB (BF16) to just  (int4) Shrinks from 24 GB (BF16) to only  (int4) Reduces from 8 GB (BF16) to a lean  (int4) Goes from 2 GB (BF16) down to a tiny  (int4)This figure only represents the VRAM required to load the model weights. Running the model also requires additional VRAM for the KV cache, which stores information about the ongoing conversation and depends on the context lengthRun Gemma 3 on Your DeviceThese dramatic reductions unlock the ability to run larger, powerful models on widely available consumer hardware: Now fits comfortably on a single desktop NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) or similar card, allowing you to run our largest Gemma 3 variant locally. Runs efficiently on laptop GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (8GB VRAM), bringing powerful AI capabilities to portable machines. Offer even greater accessibility for systems with more constrained resources, including phones and toasters (if you have a good one).Easy Integration with Popular ToolsWe want you to be able to use these models easily within your preferred workflow. Our official int4 and Q4_0 unquantized QAT models are available on Hugging Face and Kaggle. We’ve partnered with popular developer tools that enable seamlessly trying out the QAT-based quantized checkpoints: Get running quickly – all our Gemma 3 QAT models are natively supported starting today with a simple command. Easily download and run Gemma 3 QAT models on your desktop via its user-friendly interface. Leverage MLX for efficient, optimized inference of Gemma 3 QAT models on Apple Silicon. Use our dedicated C++ implementation for highly efficient inference directly on the CPU. Integrate easily into existing workflows thanks to native support for our GGUF-formatted QAT models.More Quantizations in the GemmaverseOur official Quantization Aware Trained (QAT) models provide a high-quality baseline, but the vibrant Gemmaverse offers many alternatives. These often use Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), with significant contributions from members such as Bartowski, Unsloth, and GGML readily available on Hugging Face. Exploring these community options provides a wider spectrum of size, speed, and quality trade-offs to fit specific needs.Bringing state-of-the-art AI performance to accessible hardware is a key step in democratizing AI development. With Gemma 3 models, optimized through QAT, you can now leverage cutting-edge capabilities on your own desktop or laptop.Explore the quantized models and start building:We can't wait to see what you build with Gemma 3 running locally!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>British Royals leave after attending service at St. George&apos;s Chapel in Windosr</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TgHQD85C74</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2TgHQD85C74?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 12:13:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Britain's King Charles III and Queen Camilla were given a small posy of flowers by two young children as the left St. George's Chapel's Deanery in Windsor on Sunday morning after attending the Easter service.

In the post, he invoked the suffering and resurrection of Christ to inspire hope for peace and victory. “May evil’s hour end. May the day of life arrive. The day of peace. The day of Ukraine. The day that lasts for centuries,” he wrote. “Christ is Risen! He is Risen Indeed!”, he further wrote.His message came as both sides accused each other of violating the 30-hour ceasefire announced by Moscow from Saturday, 6:00 pm to Sunday midnight. Despite the declaration, Zelenskyy said Russian troops continued shelling and launched assaults along the front.In a separate post, Zelenskyy wrote that Ukraine recorded at least 387 shelling incidents and 19 assaults from Saturday evening until midnight. On Easter morning, another 59 shelling cases and five Russian assaults were logged across the Donetsk, Starobilsk, and Zaporizhzhia sectors. Dozens of FPV drone strikes were also reported.“In some areas, Russia is still continuing isolated attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,” Zelenskyy wrote on Sunday, citing a frontline report from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi.Zelenskyy reiterated that Ukraine had proposed a 30-day ceasefire extension, which “remains on the table.” He stressed that Kyiv would continue to act based on “the actual situation on the ground.” The Ukrainian President also warned against trusting Moscow’s ceasefire promises, noting Russia’s previous rejection of Kyiv’s offer for a full, unconditional truce.Putin had attended an Easter service in Moscow just hours after announcing the ceasefire. However, there were no details from the Kremlin on how it would be enforced or monitored, and Russian officials in occupied Kherson accused Ukraine of violating the truce.Soldiers and civilians on both sides remained sceptical. AFP quoted Ukrainian frontline soldiers who doubted the sincerity of Moscow’s truce, while some Russian civilians felt there was no need for restraint.Despite the clashes, Easter Sunday saw a rare exchange of prisoners of war. As per AFP, 246 soldiers were swapped on each side in a UAE-mediated deal, bringing the total number of returned Ukrainian POWs to 4,552.In his address, Zelenskyy underlined Ukraine’s ongoing fight for peace and freedom, saying, “We are united in this… We fight for Ukraine together. And we pray for Ukraine together.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Francis calls for peace, mercy for migrants in Easter address | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R31RU-WPYCo</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/R31RU-WPYCo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:54:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis has delighted Catholics celebrating Easter by making an appearance at St Peter's Square in the Vatican.

It&apos;s Linux All Over Again&apos;</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/20/0332214/open-source-advocate-argues-deepseek-is-a-movement-its-linux-all-over-again?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Matt Asay answered questions from Slashdot readers in 2010 (as the then-COO of Canonical). He currently runs developer relations at MongoDB (after holding similar positions at AWS and Adobe). 

This week he contributed an opinion to piece to InfoWorld arguing that DeepSeek "may have originated in China, but it stopped being Chinese the minute it was released on Hugging Face with an accompanying paper detailing its development."



Soon after, a range of developers, including the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), scrambled to replicate DeepSeek's success but this time as open source software. BAAI, for its part, launched OpenSeek, an ambitious effort to take DeepSeek's open-weight models and create a project that surpasses DeepSeek while uniting "the global open source communities to drive collaborative innovation in algorithms, data, and systems." 

If that sounds cool to you, it didn't to the U.S. government, which promptly put BAAI on its "baddie" list. Someone needs to remind U.S. (and global) policymakers that no single country, company, or government can contain community-driven open source... DeepSeek didn't just have a moment. It's now very much a movement, one that will frustrate all efforts to contain it. DeepSeek, and the open source AI ecosystem surrounding it, has rapidly evolved from a brief snapshot of technological brilliance into something much bigger — and much harder to stop. Tens of thousands of developers, from seasoned researchers to passionate hobbyists, are now working on enhancing, tuning, and extending these open source models in ways no centralized entity could manage alone. 

For example, it's perhaps not surprising that Hugging Face is actively attempting to reverse engineer and publicly disseminate DeepSeek's R1 model. Hugging Face, while important, is just one company, just one platform. But Hugging Face has attracted hundreds of thousands of developers who actively contribute to, adapt, and build on open source models, driving AI innovation at a speed and scale unmatched even by the most agile corporate labs. 

Hugging Face by itself could be stopped. But the communities it enables and accelerates cannot. Through the influence of Hugging Face and many others, variants of DeepSeek models are already finding their way into a wide range of applications. Companies like Perplexity are embedding these powerful open source models into consumer-facing services, proving their real-world utility. This democratization of technology ensures that cutting-edge AI capabilities are no longer locked behind the walls of large corporations or elite government labs but are instead openly accessible, adaptable, and improvable by a global community. 
"It's Linux all over again..." Asay writes at one point. "What started as the passion project of a lone developer quickly blossomed into an essential, foundational technology embraced by enterprises worldwide," winning out "precisely because it captivated developers who embraced its promise and contributed toward its potential." 

We are witnessing a similar phenomenon with DeepSeek and the broader open source AI ecosystem, but this time it's happening much, much faster... 
Organizations that cling to proprietary approaches (looking at you, OpenAI!) or attempt to exert control through restrictive policies (you again, OpenAI!) are not just swimming upstream — they're attempting to dam an ocean. (Yes, OpenAI has now started to talk up open source, but it's a long way from releasing a DeepSeek/OpenSeek equivalent on GitHub.)

According to the Kremlin, the ceasefire will last from 6 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT) on Saturday to midnight (2100 GMT) following Easter Sunday.Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock.His ceasefire announcement came after U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are "coming to a head" and insisted that neither side is "playing" him in his push to end the grinding three-year war.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FreeType Fixes Inefficient Code Causing 10x Startup Time Hit When Loading Arial TTF Font</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/FreeType-Slow-Loading-Arial-TTF</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:33:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The FreeType library for rendering text onto bitmaps that is widely used by a variety of applications has landed a set of three patches today providing an important performance improvement to address a significant inefficiency within the existing FreeType codebase...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thousands of protesters rally against Trump across US | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2icdEkf-8Y</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x2icdEkf-8Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 10:32:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of protesters rallied in Washington and other cities across the US to voice their opposition to Donald Trump's administration and policies, from mass deportations and government firings, to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

Board games you might enjoyPlaying board games can reduce stress and draw you into an imaginary world. Included is a list of some board games you can try. We may not have autonomy over many things, but we have the choice to dream. I am spending a lot of time dreaming now. \
One of the ways I am expressing my dreaming is through board games. Board games have been a fun distraction lately. It's been fun entering imaginary worlds and learning to play various games. What do I like about playing board games?Social aspect - Playing board games with others has been a fun way of interacting while at the same time learning new things. It can be a good way to get to know new people while taking the pressure off conversation and social skills. Stimulating, but not serious - I like feeling challenged but not overly stressed, knowing the outcome is moot/unimportant/for fun.Learning - It’s refreshing learning the rules of the new games to discover how new games worked. Learning how to quickly understand the rules of the new game I am trying has been interesting and meta. I figured out my system for learning new games is a combination of reading the rulebook included in the package and watching a youtube video about the game I am trying. Now, I am finding youtubers with a lot of my same interests. Off-screen time - Working remotely can be very isolating and stressful. Spending time away from the computer screen and my phone has helped a lot. I really crave time away from my computer for a part of each day - whether that be exercising, reading or playing board games.  \n Mentally active - Playing board games is an mentally active hobby (unlike watching tv, seeing a movie or maybe attending zoom meetings) and I liked that about it. You have to initiate playing. You have to spend time learning the rules. Then, you have to try to win!  Normally, I don't find playing games like wordle or crossword puzzles very interesting. This is perhaps because you play those games by yourself and there isn’t any tangible reward.  Board games are enthralling because you can play them socially (though some games are also playable as single player games). There is a social aspect/dopamine hit from playing the games that is satisfying. \
For the last couple of months, I have spent nearly every evening devouring board games that I have checked out free from my local library. We take time learning the rules and then watching a youtube video about the rules. It's been fun learning to set up the various games and struggle to play triumphantly.  I have listed some of the games I have played below. Board games you might like: Collect gems and gain a fortuneSearch for the assassin among 25 operatives Display cunning and character to marry the man Dice rolling, city-building strategy game UNLOCK! Heroic Adventures Card GameRequires smartphone app to play Escape room like adventures Gather commodities to build towns Enjoyable territory building game HODL UP: A Bitcoin Mining GameI met the founders of this game and played the game with them. When working remotely, I spent a lot of time in my home office. It was where I spent most of my day. It began to feel like such a treat not to be jailed in that room. Playing board games gave me a cool and interesting outlet for my social and intellectual needs. It also gave me broader horizons about board game culture and aspirations to one day create my own board game. Playing board games also gave me an escape from myself and my incessant thoughts so that I could rest. It helped me very much to find this hobby and I hope you will also consider it the next time you need a healthy escape. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nearly 300 scientists apply for French academic program amid Trump cuts in U.S.</title><link>https://www.opb.org/article/2025/04/18/amid-trump-cuts-nearly-300-u-s-based-scientists-seek-french-program/</link><author>/u/Necessary_Pie2464</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 09:49:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Students, researchers and demonstrators rally during a protest against the Trump administration's funding cuts on research, health and higher education at the University of California Los Angeles on April 8.Robyn Beck / AFP via Getty ImagesA French university courting U.S.-basedacademics said it has already received nearly 300 applications for researchers seeking “refugee status” amid President Trump’s elimination of funding for several scientific programs.Last month, Aix-Marseille University, one of the country’s oldest and largest universities, announced it was accepting applications for its Safe Place For Science program, which it said offers “a safe and stimulating environment for scientists wishing to pursue their research in complete freedom.”This week, Aix-Marseille said it had received 298 applications, and 242 of them are eligible and currently up for review. Of the eligible applicants, 135 are American, 45 have a dual nationality, 17 are French and 45 are from other countries, the university said.“I am pleased that this request for the creation of scientific refugee status has found both media and political traction,”university President Éric Berton said in a statement.The public research university said there is an even split between male and female applicants, with backgrounds from various prestigious U.S. institutions including Johns Hopkins University, NASA, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, Yale and Stanford. About 20 Americans will be accepted into the program to begin in June.“We at Aix-Marseille University are convinced that mobilization to address the challenges facing scientific research must be collective in France and Europe,” Berton said.The Trump administration has prioritized aggressive spending cuts and federal workforce reduction, leading to a battle for America’s best and brightest.Already, for example, universities and medical research facilities are set to lose billions in federal funding under the National Institutes of Health. And rollbacks on federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs have compromised research ranging from climate change to biomedical research.Aix-Marseille is not the only European institution hoping to capitalize on America’s brain drain.Last month, France’s CentraleSupélec announced a $3.2 million grant to help finance American research that had been halted in the states. And Netherlands Minister of Education, Culture and Science Eppo Bruins wrote in a letter to parliament that he requested to set up a fund aimed at bringing top international scientists to the Netherlands.There is some evidence that these entreaties are reaching curious ears.Last month in the journal , more than 1,200 respondents identifying as scientists cited Trump’s funding cuts as reasons they were considering moving to Canada or Europe.Discussion boards reviewed by NPR show academics reaching the same conclusions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine reports fighting despite Putin&apos;s &apos;Easter truce&apos; | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFZ2KQgt-Is</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/pFZ2KQgt-Is?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 09:46:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is continuing to attack Ukraine, despite Vladimir Putin's unexpected declaration of an Easter ceasefire.

Admins can choose from a variety of deployment strategies, each of which offers a different approach to application lifecycle management. Depending on factors like application availability requirements or how carefully you want to be able to test a new deployment before entrusting mission-critical workloads to it, one Kubernetes deployment strategy may be a better fit than another.To provide guidance on how to select the best deployment strategy for a given workload, this article compares eight popular Kubernetes deployment techniques, explaining their pros and cons. It also offers tips on optimizing your Kubernetes deployment strategy no matter which type or types of deployments you choose.What is a Kubernetes deployment strategy?A Kubernetes deployment strategy is the configuration that manages how Kubernetes runs and manages an application. Deployment strategies are typically defined in YAML files, which describe how Kubernetes should deploy the initial pods and containers associated with an app, as well as how it should manage updates over the course of the application’s lifecycle.Having different deployment strategy options is part of what makes Kubernetes so powerful and flexible. Depending on what an application does, you may need to manage its deployment in a specific way.For example, with some applications, it’s possible to run multiple versions of the app at the same time within the same Kubernetes cluster. In that case, you could use a deployment strategy that updates application instances one by one. But this typically wouldn’t work if all application instances need to connect to a shared database or maintain a shared global state. An appropriate deployment strategy for that scenario would require updating all application instances at the same time, in order to maintain consistency between versions.Top 8 Kubernetes deployment strategiesTo illustrate what Kubernetes deployment strategies look like in practice, here are eight examples of popular deployment patterns.A recreate deployment tells Kubernetes to delete all existing instances of a pod before creating a new one. Recreate deployment strategies are useful for situations where you need all application instances to run the same version at all times.To configure a recreate deployment, include a spec like the following in your deployment configuration:spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
	type: RecreateThis creates a deployment with three pod replicas and uses the recreate deployment strategy to maintain a consistent version across each replica.A rolling deployment (which is the default deployment strategy that Kubernetes uses if you don’t specify an alternative) manages pod updates by applying them incrementally to each pod instance. In other words, it works by restarting Kubernetes pods one by one.Rolling updates are a useful deployment strategy when it’s important to avoid downtime. Since this approach updates pod instances incrementally, it ensures that while one pod instance is being updated, other instances remain available to handle requests.The following spec configures a rolling deployment strategy:spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
	type: RollingUpdate
	rollingUpdate:
  	maxUnavailable: 1    	# Maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update
  	maxSurge: 1          	# Maximum number of Pods that can be created over the desired numberIn a blue/green deployment strategy, you maintain two distinct Kubernetes deployments – a blue deployment and a green one – and switch traffic between them. The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to test one version of your deployment and confirm that it works properly before directing traffic to it.To implement a blue/green deployment, first create two Kubernetes deployments. Use the deployment metadata field to apply a unique label to each one.Then, define a Kubernetes service that specifies which of the two Kubernetes deployments should receive requests. For example, the following service sends traffic to the blue deployment by matching the label “blue”:apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
	app: my-app
	color: blue  # Switch this to "green" during the cutover
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
	port: 80
	targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIPAs noted in the comment within the service definition, you can modify the selector to “green” in order to switch traffic to your other deployment.Blue/green deployments minimize the risk of downtime because they allow you to vet a new deployment fully before using it to handle production traffic. A downside, however, is that blue/green deployments require you to run two complete instances of your application at the same time. This is not an efficient use of resources, since only one of the instances is handling traffic.A canary deployment strategy switches traffic between distinct deployments gradually. It’s similar to a blue/green strategy in that it requires two different deployments. But whereas a blue/green deployment cuts traffic over from one deployment to the other all at once, the canary method directs some requests to one deployment while sending others to the other deployment.The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to detect problems with one of the deployments before they impact all users. It’s called a “canary” deployment because it’s analogous to using canaries in coal mines to detect the buildup of toxic gases before they reach a level that would harm humans, since canaries are especially sensitive to gases like carbon monoxide.To set up a canary deployment, first create two deployments for your application. The number of pod replicas for each deployment should reflect which percentage of traffic you want the deployment to handle. For instance, if you want one deployment to receive 60 percent of your traffic and the other to receive 40 percent, create 6 replicas in the first deployment and 4 in the second. Both deployments should match the same application label.Then, create a service that directs traffic to the matching application based on the deployment metadata. For example:apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
	app: my-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
	port: 80
	targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIPTo modify the balance between traffic over time in order to switch traffic gradually from one deployment to the other, scale the replicas within each deployment accordingly using the kubectl scale deployment command.5. A/B testing deploymentIn an A/B testing deployment, you run two distinct deployments and route traffic between them based on request type or user characteristics.For example, imagine you want to distinguish between requests from “testing” users and requests from “production” users. You could do this by differentiating between user types in request headers and routing requests on this basis. Requests with the header  would go to one deployment, while those with  would route to another.To implement an A/B testing deployment strategy, first create two deployments. Then, install a service mesh or ingress controller, such as Istio, and configure it with a routing rule that selects a deployment based on header strings.For instance, the following Istio virtual service (which targets the app  based on the deployment metadata) sends requests with  in the header to one deployment, while routing all others to the other deployment:apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - my-app
  http:
  - match:
	- headers:
    	    end-user:
      	       exact: testing     	# A/B testing condition
	route:
	- destination:
    	  host: my-app
    	  subset: v2
  - route:
	- destination:
    	  host: my-app
    	  subset: v1A shadow deployment strategy involves running two deployments. One deployment handles all requests and routes responses back to users. Meanwhile, the second deployment runs “in the shadows” and also processes some or all requests, but the responses don’t go back to users. Instead, they’re analyzed for testing purposes and then dropped.The value of a shadow deployment is that it lets you test a deployment by feeding it genuine user requests without relying on it to process those requests for production users. If the deployment is buggy, it won’t impact users, but you’ll still be able to detect the issue.To create a shadow deployment in Kubernetes, first set up two deployments for your application. Next, create a virtual service that mirrors traffic to the shadow instance, while also sending traffic to the primary instance. For example:apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  hosts:
  - my-app
  http:
  - route:
	- destination:
    	    host: my-app
    	    subset: v1
	mirror:
  	    host: my-app
  	    subset: v2
	mirrorPercentage:
  	   value: 100.0   # 100% of traffic is mirrored to v27. Best-effort controlled rolloutA best-effort controlled rollout is similar to a canary deployment in that it gradually switches traffic from one deployment to another. But it does so in a more controlled manner, often by using predefined conditions (like crossing a certain CPU usage threshold for one deployment) to determine when to change the amount of traffic going to each deployment.To implement a best-effort controlled rollout, you would typically use a third-party deployment controller like Argo and configure it to manage your rollout based on predefined criteria. For example:spec:
  replicas: 5
  strategy:
	canary:
  	  steps:
    	    - setWeight: 20
    	    - pause: { duration: 2m }
    	    - setWeight: 40
    	    - pause: { duration: 5m }
    	    - setWeight: 100This configures a type of canary deployment. But unlike a generic canary deployment strategy where you simply add replicas to each deployment over time, the rollout in this case is carefully controlled based on specific criteria.A ramped slow rollout replaces pod instances incrementally, with delays between the replacements. It’s similar to a rolling deployment, but a key difference is that with a ramped slow deployment, there is a pause between each update. This provides time to run tests and confirm that the previous update was successful before moving on to the next one.To implement a ramped slow rollout, use a controller like Argo and configure pauses between each rollout event. For instance:spec:
  replicas: 5
  strategy:
	canary:
  	  steps:
  	    - setWeight: 20
  	    - pause:
      	        duration: 2m
  	- setWeight: 40
  	- pause:
      	       duration: 5m
  	- setWeight: 100Choosing the right deployment strategy by use caseThe main consideration for deciding which deployment strategy to adopt is the type of use case you need to support. Here’s a look at common use cases and the best deployment strategies for each one.For stateless applications, a simple rolling deployment usually makes the most sense. If there is no application, it’s not typically important to keep pod instances in sync, so you can update them one by one without causing problems.For most stateful applications, a recreate deployment strategy works best. Recreate deployments ensure that application versions remain consistent across all instances, helping to keep state in sync.Note as well that typically, you’d use a StatefulSet instead of a deployment to run a stateful application. (For details, check out our article on Kubernetes StatefulSet vs deployment.) But you can apply most types of deployment strategies to StatefulSets as well as to deployments.High-traffic applicationsFor applications that receive a lot of traffic on a continuous basis, a canary deployment or one of its variants (like a best-effort controlled rollout or a ramped slow rollout) is usually the best fit. These methods make it possible to route traffic between multiple deployments, which in turn helps to balance load and ensure that no one deployment becomes overwhelmed.Mission-critical and zero-downtime appsFor use cases where you can’t tolerate any downtime, consider a blue/green deployment. This approach allows you to validate a new deployment fully before sending traffic to it.A shadow deployment could also be a good choice for this use case. It would allow you to real-user perform testing on a new deployment before directing requests to it.A/B testing deployment strategies may also work well for certain mission-critical apps, especially if only certain users or requests are critical. In that case, you can send the high-value requests to one deployment that you’ve carefully tested, while routing less critical ones to another deployment.Batch processing and background jobsFor use cases that involve processing data in batches or running background jobs, a simple recreate or rollout deployment strategy typically works well. More complex and advanced deployment strategies aren’t usually necessary for these use cases because you usually don’t need to worry as much about the potential for downtime or running multiple versions of an application at the same time.Factors to consider when selecting a deployment strategyBeyond aligning deployment strategies with use cases, it’s also important to consider the following factors:Deployment downtime tolerance: The less downtime you can accept for a workload, the more important it is to use a low-risk deployment strategy, like rolling or blue/green Kubernetes deployments.Traffic flow and load management: If you need fine-grained control over traffic flow and load balancing, consider an A/B testing or controlled rollout deployment, which allows you to route traffic based on predefined rules.Failover, rollback, and reversal mechanisms: If it’s important to be able to revert to a previous version of a deployment, use either a blue/green or canary deployment method. These approaches make it possible to switch back to one deployment in the event that a newer deployment turns out to be buggy.Security and compliance considerations: Some Kubernetes deployments are subject to specific security and compliance requirements. For instance, if you need to ensure that security patches roll out to all application instances (to avoid leaving some vulnerable instances), you’d want a recreate deployment method. Or, if you need to route requests for users based in a certain area to a specific deployment to meet compliance rules that apply to those users, you could use an A/B testing deployment strategy.Scalability and auto-healing capabilities: Canary deployments are useful because they provide control over deployment scalability. They can also offer some auto-healing capabilities because Kubernetes will automatically attempt to maintain the number of replicas specified for each deployment – so if some replicas fail, Kubernetes can self-heal by restoring them.Best practices for a seamless Kubernetes deploymentNo matter which deployment strategy you choose, the following best practices can help minimize risk and simplify administration:: Some deployment strategies (like recreate and rolling Kubernetes deployments) are much simpler than others (like best-effort controlled rollouts). In general, simpler is better. Don’t implement a complex deployment strategy, or one that requires the use of additional tools (like Istio or Argo) unless you need the special capabilities it provides.: Prior to entrusting production traffic to a deployment, it’s a best practice to test it first. You can do this using synthetic requests, or you can direct real user requests to a deployment via a method like shadow deployments.Monitor and observe Kubernetes deployments: To detect issues with a deployment, it’s critical to monitor and observe all application instances. Methods like blue/green and canary deployments are only useful if you have the monitoring and observability data necessary to detect problems with one deployment and route traffic appropriately.Consider resource overhead: Deployment strategies that require you to maintain multiple Kubernetes deployments at the same time create more resource overhead (because more deployments require more resources to run). This can lead to poorer performance because Kubernetes cluster resources are tied up with redundant deployments. For this reason, it’s important to evaluate how many spare resources your Kubernetes cluster has and choose a deployment method accordingly.Optimizing and monitoring Kubernetes deployments with groundcoverWhen it comes to monitoring Kubernetes deployments and troubleshooting problems, groundcover as you covered. Using hyper-efficient eBPF-based observability, groundcover clues you in - in real time - to deployment performance issues like dropped requests or high latency rates. We also continuously track CPU, memory, and other performance metrics, so you’ll know right away if any of your Kubernetes deployments are at risk of becoming overwhelmed.We can’t tell you exactly which deployment strategy is best for a given workload. But we can give you the observability data you need to make an informed decision about Kubernetes deployment strategies.A balanced approach to Kubernetes deploymentUltimately, Kubernetes deployment strategies boil down to balancing performance and control on the one hand with risk and complexity on the other. If you just want to deploy an application simply and quickly, Kubernetes lets you do that – although simple deployment methods are sometimes more risky.You can also opt for more complex and fine-tuned deployment strategies that – like a complex chess move – require more expertise to carry out, but that can pay off in the long run by delivering a better balance between risk and performance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Budapest sends letters urging Hungarians to vote against Ukraine&apos;s EU accession, vows to treat result as binding</title><link>https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/19/7508270/</link><author>/u/schmeckfest</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 08:17:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Hungarian government has begun distributing ballots for a national consultation asking citizens whether they support Ukraine's accession to the European Union.

There are no reports of casualties.Putin ordered his forces to "stop all military activity" in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere.Russia's defence ministry insisted all Russian forces had been adhering to the truce and accused Ukraine's army of breaking it.Russia said Ukrainian units fired at the positions of Russian troops 444 times, carried out 900 strikes with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), 12 shellings, 33 strikes by UAVs and seven drops of munitions. The ministry said there were dead and wounded among the civilian population. It did not give any details.Zelensky on Sunday morning said Moscow was "trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine."Accusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that"everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation."Because Putin's ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but the BBC in Ukraine reports it has been quieter on the front lines.Before Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies. The only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea. In the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscow's announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea.Late on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: "If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions." "Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table — the answer to it must come from Moscow," he wrote on X. Zelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to. It seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelensky's offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace.Few Ukrainians think that is remotely possible.Putin had announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov."Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period," Putin told Gerasimov."We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions."The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was "mutually respected" by Ukraine.It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal. Reacting to the recent truce announcement, a UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: "Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter."Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides. The US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress. Last month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.US President Donald Trump on Friday warned Washington would "take a pass" on brokering further talks on ending the war in Ukraine unless there was quick progress.He was speaking after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not "going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end", as it had "other priorities to focus on"."We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable," he added. "If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New &apos;Star Wars&apos; Movie Announced Set 5 Years After &apos;Rise of Skywalker&apos;</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/04/19/2211253/new-star-wars-movie-announced-set-5-years-after-rise-of-skywalker?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new Star Wars movie — starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Shawn Levy — will be released in 2027, the two announced Friday at the "Star Wars Celebration" (a fan event in Japan). CNN reports:

 Set to begin production this fall, the movie will be set approximately five years after "Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker," released in 2019, but will sit outside the Skywalker story as a standalone film. "The film... is an entirely new adventure featuring all-new characters set in a period of time that has not been explored on screen," said a statement from Lucasfilm, the owner of the "Star Wars" franchise... 

 "The script is just so good, the story, it has so much adventure, so much heart and original character. It's an opportunity to shine the light into a side of the universe that we may not have seen," Gosling said. Levy, the director of "Deadpool & Wolverine," told the crowd the film would have all the "fun of 'Star Wars'" but it would be done "in ways that are new and original...." 

The next movie in the franchise, "The Mandalorian & Grogu," a spin-off of "The Mandalorian" series, directed by Jon Favreau, will hit cinemas in May 2026.
 

USA Today notes that more new Star Wars movies have also been announced:

Daisy Ridley is set to star in a film that will see her character, Rey, building a new Jedi Order after the events of "The Rise of Skywalker." [This is sometimes referred to as "Star Wars Episode X: New Jedi Order."] 

"Logan" filmmaker James Mangold has also been tapped to direct a movie about the dawn of the Jedi, and [Dave] Filoni is directing one said to "close out the interconnected stories" told in the live-action Disney+ shows like "The Mandalorian."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From AP archives: BP&apos;s Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoDV9124K14</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HoDV9124K14?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[April 20 marks 15 years since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill when BP's oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast — killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons of crude gushing into the ocean — resulting in the United States' worst offshore oil spill.

The UN says at least 400 civilians were killed. One of the largest camps for internally displaced people in Sudan, local aid groups say the RSF targeted civilians on an ethnic basis, hunting down community leaders and their families.
RSF fighters released video that has been verified by matching trees and the road layout with satellite imagery. They drive through the camp with smoke rising and fires burning in the distance. One of them says in arabic: 'Inside Zamzam, Zamzam is free of everything, God is great.'
The RSF have declared a seperate rival government in the areas they control. What life might be like there is clear from other video from Zamzam, which is too graphic for us to show: It shows RSF fighters shooting unarmed men lying on the ground. Other images show fighters standing over several dead bodies lying in the road. Seen from above, the extent of the mass destruction is clear: This satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies shows buildings erased in Zamzam, mirroring prior RSF attacks. The RSF has dismissed the allegations, saying the camp was being used as a base for army-aligned groups.

But that's triggered a series of dominoes. "In the two days after the limits became public, shares of Nvidia, the world's leading AI chipmaker, fell 8.4%. AMD's shares dropped 7.4%, and Intel's were down 6.8%." (AMD expects up to $800 million in charges after the move, according to CNBC, while NVIDIA said it would take a quarterly charge of about $5.5 billion.) 

The Times notes hopeful remarks Thursday from Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, during a meeting with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. "We're going to continue to make significant effort to optimize our products that are compliant within the regulations and continue to serve China's market." But America's chipmakers also have a greater fear, according to the article: "that their retreat could turn the Chinese tech giant Huawei into a global chip-making powerhouse."
 "For the U.S. semiconductor industry, China is gone," said Handel Jones, a semiconductor consultant at International Business Strategies, which advises electronics companies. He projects that Chinese companies will have a majority share of chips in every major category in China by 2030... Huang's message spoke to one of his biggest fears. For years, he has worried that Huawei, China's telecommunications giant, will become a major competitor in AI. He has warned U.S. officials that blocking U.S. companies from competing in China would accelerate Huawei's rise, said three people familiar with those meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 If Huawei gains ground, Huang and others at Nvidia have painted a dark picture of a future in which China will use the company's chips to build AI data centers across the world for the Belt and Road Initiative, a strategic effort to increase Beijing's influence by paying for infrastructure projects around the world, a person familiar with the company's thinking said... 

 Nvidia's previous generation of chips perform about 40% better than Huawei's best product, said Gregory C. Allen, who has written about Huawei in his role as director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But that gap could dwindle if Huawei scoops up the business of its American rivals, Allen said. Nvidia was expected to make more than $16 billion in sales this year from the H20 in China before the restriction. Huawei could use that money to hire more experienced engineers and make higher-quality chips. Allen said the U.S. government's restrictions also could help Huawei bring on customers like DeepSeek, a leading Chinese AI startup. Working with those companies could help Huawei improve the software it develops to control its chips. Those kinds of tools have been one of Nvidia's strengths over the years. 
TechRepublic identifies this key quote from an earlier article:

"This kills NVIDIA's access to a key market, and they will lose traction in the country," Patrick Moorhead, a tech analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, told The New York Times. He added that Chinese companies will buy from local rival Huawei instead.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope Sends Deputy to Lecture Vance on Compassion at Vatican</title><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/pope-snubs-vance-and-gets-deputy-to-lecture-vp-on-compassion/</link><author>/u/RGV_KJ</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 03:47:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pope Francis did not attend the Vatican’s official meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Saturday, instead having his No. 2 deliver a lecture on compassion, according to a Vatican statement.Pope Francis was absent from Vance’s conversation with Cardinal Pietro Parolin. However, the statement said there was “an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners.”It called for “serene collaboration” between the White House and the Catholic Church in the United States—a seeming hint to the tensions that have brewed between the two since President Donald Trump took office.A statement from Vance’s office about the meeting, however, did not include migration among the topics of conversation.It said the two discussed “the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world” as well as Trump’s “commitment to restoring world peace,” Bloomberg reported.Inside Vatican sources told Sky News that Vance did briefly meet with the pope at his residence, but no details of their conversation have been made public.Pope Francis has repeatedly rebuked the president’s mass deportation effort, calling it a “disgrace” and a “grave sin.”The pontiff has also specifically confronted Vance, who is the highest-ranking Catholic in the U.S. government, having converted in 2019. Without mentioning the vice president by name, the pope corrected a Catholic concept Vance had invoked to defend the administration’s deportations,  (order of love). In a February letter, Francis pointedly explained, “Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups.”Vance acknowledged the Pope’s criticism, calling himself a “baby Catholic” and admitting that there are “things about the faith that I don’t know.” In January, Vance found himself in a tussle with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops after he suggested they were helping “resettle illegal immigrants” to secure funding.New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan fired back that Vance’s remarks were “scurrilous,” “nasty,” and “not true.”The pope, 88, is recovering from a serious bout of pneumonia that kept him in the hospital for more than a month. However, he has resumed his official duties. He was well enough to meet with King Charles and Queen Camilla when they visited the Vatican last week.Vance is spending the Easter weekend in Rome after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He and his wife, Usha Vance, were in attendance at the Vatican’s Good Friday service, reported.Editor’s note: This story has been updated to make clear that the Pope did not snub J.D. Vance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>100 Years to Solve an Integral (2020)</title><link>https://liorsinai.github.io/mathematics/2020/08/27/secant-mercator.html</link><author>blobcode</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 03:16:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Denmark&apos;s elderly step up to fill the void left by dwindling youth | Focus on Europe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfA_xJHnlu8</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PfA_xJHnlu8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 02:45:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thorben Alstrup is a bus driver – at 83.

Unfortunately, there are a  of both outdated and overly complicated blogs, sample repositories and old projects out there.One key philosophy of Go, is keeping things simple. More code writing, less structuring ahead of time (before it’s actually needed).The official guide on this topic is go.dev/doc/modules/layout - which you should read if you haven’t already, then come back here. Despite that reference (and maybe in part because of it) people still tend to over complicate. For instance it says packages or commands  benefit from splitting off some functionality into supporting packages.  it’s recommended placing such packages into a directory named internal; […] Since other projects cannot import code from our internal directory, we’re free to refactor its API and generally move things around without breaking external users.Emphasis on  and  is mine. And seems to be missed by many. 99% of people do not need  when, be real, most of what gets written will never be reused much and even if it is, don’t worry about over publishing. And the  is, in my opinion wrong. Initially, make something useful and don’t worry that it’ll get such great adoption that you’re stuck into maintaining your early layout forever, you’re not… (see semver point below too).Likewise, you don’t need to use  when you only have 1 binary (or even a few and no library).In general because a feature exists, doesn’t mean to have to use it (e.g ). Or because some people have a convention doesn’t mean you should follow (like your mom probably used to say “if they jump off a bridge… will you?”, remember? ).By the way, stick to 0.x semver (another pet peeve of mine is the v2/v3/… in go) for as long as you can and document what you change and why, rather than under-publishing and forcing people to fork to access what they really need and you didn’t foresee.So one infamous example of the nonsense is the fake “golang-standards” - see github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/issues/117 and other closed issues for why it’s  a standard. This led folks to come up with a counter point at github.com/go-standard/project-layout (which I contributed a few additions/corrections) but also got flak for having the word “standard” in it… so here you go, below is  (based on decades of professional experience in many languages, including 7 years of go at top companies and OSS projects) - Some of the text comes from there:Main package in the root is great, it makes for the shortest and cleanest install/run:go github.com/you/project@latest
Which is typically the priority if you do have a CLI or server to ship. Pure libraries obviously have no main at the root.If you do have both, you could move the main out of the way in a child directory (people like  but the  part is actually not needed) or move the library into a directory that will make importing and using it readable. Consider also you may have more than 1 library package to publish in which case  and  makes total sense and keep the top level for the main binary.For many small to medium-sized projects, these are the only packages you need.Just in case you do not know already, as a refresher,  is not a convention, it’s a feature of the go tool chain: code in or below such directory is importable only by code in the directory tree rooted at the parent of .But you don’t need that, unless you’re shipping code to  of third party users and have a lot of code that can’t just be lower case not exported, yet used in many exported packages, you don’t need to hide your code… it’s not so precious or such a huge commitment.Any package you put into a pkg directory can be moved to the root.
 is a very outdated convention from before  (and you saw what I think about internal/).Some people think that having packages at the top, “clutters”, the directory. First what does get cluttered if you add unnecessary directory layers in every single import in dozen of files and possibly hundreds of dependencies… think about them! Second, feel free to move the various docs, ancillary files, etc to some subdirectory. Lastly what is ‘clutter’ really, navigation through the code probably comes through your “godoc” (the excellent pkg.go.dev, or your self hosted equivalent for private repositories).Btw don’t get me started with repos that have dozens of packages and files and where to see what is going on without an IDE, you have to go: main.go -> some other file -> some init file -> some start function -> some other files… while all this could be in 1 or 2 places, easier to follow and find.Those functions, types, and methods which you think belong in a separate  (or , or , or ) package simply don’t. Try to put them where they belong, probably near where they are used, or in their own meaningfully named package (e.g applog for your application logging utils).But Laurent, I’m more comfortable with…Let me guess, you have more experience writing Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, or C# than you do writing C, C++, or Perl. Please consider that package structuring is more an art than hard rules.You can have more than 1 file in a package/directory in go. You don’t need to make a new package each time to separate code/types/… And the more packages the more chances to create a loop or having to later move code around. This being said, moving code around is good and an easy way to grow your code base - later, when needed.Also please don’t make many files with only a few lines in them either, it makes it painful to look at your code.There are lots of example of overly complicated repos. I’d give my own repos but they also evolved organically and aren’t actually that good/or simple, but here we go anyway:Library + CLIs: that one is somewhat oddly set up as it has 2 libraries, one at the root where it started and a newer one, so not exactly best practices github.com/fortio/terminalThis post is partially in response to what I see is over complication in many small projects, which isn’t to say it’s always right or applicable either, but if it gets folks to pause and consider, even to disagree. I think it’s mission accomplished.Ping me on gopher slack (Laurent Demailly) or discord (_dl) if you disagree, have comments etc… or open an issue

Kilb flagged the data to Vera Schulte-Pelkum, a research scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences and an associate research professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder... Using the newfound data, the researchers imaged the Sierra Nevada through a technique known as receiver function analysis, which uses seismic waves to map Earth's internal structure. The scientists found that in the central region of the mountain range, Earth's crust is currently peeling away, a process scientifically known as lithospheric foundering. Kilb and Schulte-Pelkum reported the findings in December in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 

The hypothesis lined up with previous speculation that the area had undergone lithospheric foundering, which happens when Earth's outermost layer sinks into the lower layer of the mantle. Now, the study authors believe that the process is ongoing and is currently progressing to the north of the mountain range, according to the study... What's happening under the Sierra Nevada could offer rare insight into how the continents formed, Schulte-Pelkum said. The finding could also help scientists identify more areas where this process is happening as well as provide a better understanding of earthquakes and how our planet operates, she added... 

Evidence for this process has been hard to come by. It is not visible from above ground, and it's an extremely slow process. Scientists theorize that the south Sierra finished the process of lithospheric foundering about 4 million to 3 million years ago, according to the study. It appears that these natural events happen occasionally around the world, Schulte-Pelkum said. "Geologically speaking, this is a pretty quick process with long periods of stability in between. ... This (lithosphere foundering) probably started happening a long time ago when we started building continents, and (the continents) have gotten bigger over time. So it's just sort of this punctuated, localized thing," she added... 


Further study within this area could also help scientists better understand how the Earth evolves on long timescales. If the lithospheric foundering continues underneath the mountain range, one can speculate that the land will continue to stretch vertically, changing the way the landscape looks now [said Mitchell McMillan, a research geologist and postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech, who was not involved with the study]. But that could take anywhere from several hundred thousand to a few million years, he added.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hong Kong’s oldest pro-democracy party is shutting down as Beijing leaves no room for dissent</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/19/asia/hong-kong-democratic-party-disbands-china-intl-hnk/index.html</link><author>/u/BreakfastTop6899</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 01:30:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hong Kong’s oldest and largest pro-democracy political party is moving to disband as Beijing’s sweeping crackdown on the city leaves even moderate opposition groups with no room to operate.
    
            The Democratic Party, one of the leading voices of opposition in the semi-autonomous city for the past three decades, has started the process of dissolution following recent warnings from Chinese government officials, two of its veteran members told CNN.
    
            “The message was that the party has to be disbanded or there will be consequences,” said one of them, Yeung Sum, a former Democratic Party chairman.
    
            Fred Li, a former lawmaker, said a Chinese official told him that the party should not remain until the end of this year, when an election will be held.
    
            Founded by liberal lawyers and academics three years before the former British colony’s 1997 handover to China, the Democratic Party had campaigned for universal suffrage and on matters from labor rights to conservation during a period when such issues were openly discussed in the city.
    
            Widely seen as moderates willing to work with Beijing, Democratic Party leaders had spearheaded a significant voting bloc in the city’s legislature and were regularly afforded space to critique local government policy, until mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 ushered in a new and more restrictive political era.
    
            Beijing’s crackdown in the years since, including the prosecution and jailing of pro-democracy leaders, has left the once-influential party rudderless as it contends with sweeping national security legislation and “patriots only” electoral reforms enacted in 2021 that make it nearly impossible for opposition candidates to stand for the city’s legislature.
    
            Democratic Party chairman Lo Kin-hei told a news conference last Sunday that 90% of about 110 party members had voted to delegate power to a committee to start the dissolution process, adding he hoped a final vote would take place in the coming months.
    
            “I hope Hong Kong’s political parties… will continue to work for the people,” Lo said. “We have always hoped to serve the Hong Kong people, and to do things that are good for society.”
    
            The Democrats’ move to disband demonstrates Beijing’s unwillingness to allow even the mildest of dissenting voices to be heard in Hong Kong, say analysts.
    
            John Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), said the party had “symbolized the promise of some kind of democratic development in Hong Kong, leading to universal suffrage as promised in the Basic Law,” referring to the city’s mini-constitution.
    
            “A dissolution of the party reflects official Hong Kong’s turn away from popular participation, locally accountable government, and increased transparency toward more authoritarian rule,” Burns said.
    
            Eric Lai, a research fellow at the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said the Democrats’ move “shows there are no more feasible ways for groups to exist as an opposition party.”
    
            “It’s self-conflicting for the government to suggest that nothing has changed,” he said.
    
            In a statement to CNN, a city government spokesperson said decisions by individual groups “to disband or suspend operation are completely unrelated to the freedom or rights enshrined in Hong Kong law.”
    
            Criticism of the government remains permitted in Hong Kong, “however strong, vigorous or critical” it may be, so long as it is “based on facts,” the spokesperson said. The Hong Kong government would “continue to resolutely discharge the duty of safeguarding national security,” they added.
    
            The Democrats had enjoyed relative political freedom following Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule, even holding more seats than any other party in the mostly pro-Beijing legislature until 2004.
    
            The party’s leaders were often the figureheads of major demonstrations, including an annual June 4 vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre and a well-attended pro-democracy march held every July. (Neither event would be permitted on the Chinese mainland, and both are now effectively banned in Hong Kong).
    
            But support for the Democrats plunged in 2010 after its leaders negotiated directly for universal suffrage with officials from Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong – a move seen as a betrayal by other pro-democracy groups.
    
            The party was then pushed further to the sidelines by the emergence of a new generation of pro-democracy leaders and student activists during months-long protests for universal suffrage in 2014.
    
            However, when anti-government demonstrators returned to Hong Kong’s streets en masse in 2019, the Democrats’ popularity resurged as many of its leaders stood on the front lines of the massive – and sometimes violent – protests that rocked the financial hub.
    
            Later that year, the Democratic Party was the biggest winner in local district council elections. But its participation in the protests also drew the ire of Hong Kong authorities and Beijing, paving the way for its demise.
    
            “The party made mistakes when it failed to draw a clear line between itself and radical separatists calling for Hong Kong’s independence from 2014-2020,” said Burns, from HKU. “Authorities have punished the party, jailing and chasing out Democratic Party leaders.”
    
            Over the past five years, the space for the Democrats to maneuver has been increasingly squeezed by Chinese authorities.
    
            In 2020, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, introducing the maximum sentence of life imprisonment for four main crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
    A year later, the Chinese government rewrote Hong Kong’s electoral rules to require candidates to seek nomination from pro-Beijing groups, essentially excluding the opposition from elections. A legislature filled with Beijing loyalists last year unanimously passed a law expanding the scope of national security offenses.
            Beijing and the Hong Kong government argued that the electoral changes had enhanced democracy and have repeatedly defended the security laws as restoring order and returning prosperity to the city. But critics say they have curtailed freedoms and had a “chilling effect” on civil society, including independent institutions and the media.
    
            Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London, said political and social protests seen as challenging state security are “becoming increasingly if not well-nigh impossible.”
    
            “Many other elements of civil rights, including that of speech and organizing political parties have also been severely curtailed,” he added.
    
            Last year, five former Democratic Party lawmakers were among 45 opposition figures sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years after they were found guilty of subversion for taking part in an election primary in 2020.
    
            National security police have also placed HK$1 million ($129,000) bounties on pro-democracy activists who fled overseas, including an Australia-based former Democratic Party lawmaker accused of secession, subversion and collusion with a foreign country.
    
            Meanwhile, the trial of media tycoon and outspoken democracy supporter Jimmy Lai is ongoing, more than four years after he was detained on charges of colluding with foreign forces, which he denies.
    
            The Democratic Party’s announcement last weekend follows the dissolution of almost 100 civil and pro-democracy organizations in Hong Kong in the wake of Beijing’s crackdown.
    
            The party had tried to survive as a civic group in recent years but struggled to raise funds as multiple private venues canceled their events, often at the last minute.
    
            Former Democratic Party lawmaker Emily Lau said the party’s move to disband was “very sad.”
    
            “We’ve been around for over 30 years, and we’ve got the support of many Hong Kong people,” she told CNN outside court in February, before another former party lawmaker was jailed on charges of rioting during the 2019 protests.
    
            “I don’t know what they are thinking in Beijing. We have demonstrated, not just words, but by action, that we are reasonable. We are willing to talk, to negotiate, to compromise, reach a deal and go forward.”

Much inspiration taken from Shepmaster (kirby) and the Rust Playground in code execution design, and collaborative editors like Rustpad.Like the Rust Playground, Corust supports execution on stable/nightly/beta channels and cargo test/build/run in debug/release, and many top crates (~250 crates from lib.rs/std.atom, thanks to Kornel for quickly adding this!). Unlike the Playground, Corust does not yet support sharing gists, or extra tooling like viewing assembly, clippy, or rustfmt.Stack is an Axum server, Next JS UI, CodeMirror editor, and docker for containerized execution. Collaboration uses operational transform (OT) for conflict resolution and the OT client is compiled to WebAssembly on the front end.Added some Rust related easter eggs too.

We'll move from a tightly coupled, untestable nightmare to a happy place where production doesn't fall over at 3am.We're going to transform the Very Bad Application gradually, zooming out a little at a time until you see the whole hexagon. Then I'll answer "why hexagons?". Promise.I've omitted details like module names and folder structure for simplicity. Don't worry, though. Before this guide is over, you'll have a complete application template you can reuse across all your projects.The repository pattern in RustThe worst part of the Very Bad Application is undoubtedly having an HTTP handler making direct queries to an SQL database. This is a plus-sized violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.Code that understands the HTTP request-response cycle shouldn't also understand SQL. Code that needs a database doesn't need to know how that database is implemented. These could not be more different concerns.Hard-coding your handler to manage SQL transactions will come back to bite you if you switch to Mongo. That Mongo connection will need ripping out if you move to event streaming, to querying a CQRS service, or to making an intern do it by hand.All of these are valid data stores. If you overcommit by hard-wiring any one of them into your system, you guarantee future pain when you can least afford it – when you need to scale.Repository is the general term for "some store of data". Our first step is to move the  handler away from SQL and towards the abstract concept of a repository.A handler that says "give me any store of data" is much better than a handler that says "give me this specific store of data, because it's the only one I know how to use".Your mind has undoubtedly turned to traits as Rust's way of defining behaviour as opposed to structure. How very astute of you. Let's define an  trait:An  is some store of author data with (currently) one method: . takes a reference to the data required to create an author , and returns a  containing either a saved , or a specific error type describing everything that might go wrong while creating an author .  Right now, that's just the existence of duplicate authors, but we'll come back to error handling. is what's known as a domain trait. You might also have heard the term "port" before – a point of entry to your business logic. A concrete implementation of a port (say, an SQLite ) is called an adapter. Starting to sound familiar?For any code that requires access to a store of author data, this port is the source of truth for how every implementation behaves. Callers no longer have to think about SQL or message queues, they just invoke this API, and the underlying adapter does all the hard work.,  and  are all examples of .Domain models are the canonical representations of data accepted by your business logic. Nothing else will do. Let's see some definitions:Now, these aren't very exciting models (they'll get more exciting when we talk about identifying the correct domain boundaries and the special concern of authentication in ). But they demonstrate how the domain defines what data flowing through the system must look like.If you don't construct a valid  from the raw parts you've received over the wire (or from that intern), you can't call AuthorRepository::create_author. Sorry, jog on. 🤷This pattern of newtyping should be familiar if you've read . If you haven't, I'll wait for you here.Four special properties arise from this:Your business domain becomes the single source of truth for what it means to be an author, user, bank transaction or stock trade.The flow of dependencies in your application points in only one direction: towards your domain.Data structures within your domain are guaranteed to be in a valid state.You don't allow third-party implementation details, like SQL transactions or RPC messages to flow through unrelated code.And this has immediate practical benefits:Easier navigation of the codebase for veterans and new joiners.It's trivial to implement new data stores or input sources – you just implement the corresponding domain trait.Refactoring is dramatically simplified thanks to the absence of hard-coded implementation details. If an implementation of a domain trait changes, nothing about the domain code or anything downstream from it needs to change.Testability skyrockets, because any domain trait, like  can be mocked. We'll see this in action shortly.Why do we distinguish  from ? Surely we could represent both saved and unsaved s asRight now, with this exact application, this would be fine. It might be annoying to check whether  is  or  to distinguish whether  is saved or unsaved, but it would work.However, we'd be mistaken in assuming that the data required to create an  and the representation of an existing  will never diverge. This is not at all true of real applications.I've done a lot of work in onboarding and ID verification for fintechs. The data required to fully represent a customer is extensive. It can take many weeks to collect it and make an account fully operational.This is pretty poor as a customer experience, and abandonment would be high if you took an all-or-nothing approach to account creation.Instead, an initial outline of a customer's details is usually enough to create a basic profile. You get the customer interacting with the platform as soon as possible, and stagger the collection of the remaining data, fleshing out the model over time.In this scenario, you don't want to represent some  and  in the same way.  may contain dozens of optional fields and relations that aren't required to create a record in the database. It would be brittle and inefficient to pass such a needlessly large struct when creating a customer.What happens when the domain representation of a customer changes, but the data required to create one remains the same? You'd be forced to change your request handling code too. Or, you'd be forced to do what you should have done from the start – decouple these models.Hexagonal architecture is about building for change. Although these models may look like duplicative boilerplate to begin with, don't be fooled. Your application will change. Your API  diverge from your domain representation.By modeling persistent entities separately from requests to create them, you encode an incredible capacity to scale.Error types and hexagonal architectureLet's zoom in on . It reveals some important properties of domain models and traits. doesn't define failure cases such as an input name being invalid. This is the responsibility of the  constructor (which in this case delegates to the  constructor). Here's more on  if you're unclear on this point. defines failures that arise from coordinating the action of adapters. There are two categories: violations of business rules, like attempting to create a duplicate author, and unexpected errors that the domain doesn't know how to handle.Much as our domain would like to pretend the real world doesn't exist,  things can go wrong when calling a database. We could fail to start a transaction, or fail to commit it. The database could literally catch fire in the course of a request.The domain doesn't know anything about database implementations. It doesn't know about transactions. It doesn't know about the fire hazards posed by large datacenters and your pyromaniac intern. It's oblivious to retry strategies, cache layers and dead letter queues (we'll talk about these in ).But it needs some mechanism to propagate unexpected errors back up the call chain. This is typically achieved with a catch-all variant, , which wraps a general error type.  is particularly convenient for this, since it includes a backtrace for any error it wraps.As a result (no pun intended),  is a complete description of everything that can go wrong when creating an author.This is incredible news for callers of domain traits – immensely powerful. Any code calling a port has a complete description of every error scenario it's expected to handle, and the compiler will make sure that it does.But enough theorizing! Let's see this in practice.Implementing Here, I move the code required to interact with an SQLite database out of the Very Bad Application's  handler and into an implementation of .We start by wrapping an sqlx connection pool in our own  type. Module paths for sqlx types are fully qualified to avoid confusion:Wrapping types like  has the benefit of encapsulating a third-party dependencies within code of our own design. Remember the Very Bad Application's leaky  function ? Wrapping external libraries and exposing only the functionality your application needs is how we plug the leaks.Again, don't worry about module structure for now. Get comfortable with the type definitions, then we'll assemble the pieces.This constructor does what you'd expect, with the possible exception of the result it returns. This constructor isn't part of the  trait, so we're not bound by its strict opinions on the types of allowable error. is an excellent crate for working with non-specific errors.  is equivalent to , and  says we don't care  error occurred, just that one did.At the point where most applications are instantiating databases, the only reasonable thing to do with an error is log it to  or some log aggregation service.  simply wraps any sqlx error it encounters with some extra context .Now, the exciting stuff – the implementation of :Look! Transaction management is now encapsulated within our  implementation of . The HTTP handler no longer has to know about it. invokes the  method on , which isn't specified by the  trait, but gives  the freedom to set up and pass around transactions as it requires.This is the beauty of abstracting implementation details behind traits. The trait defines what needs to happen, and the implementation decides how. None of the  is visible to code calling a trait method.'s implementation of  knows all about SQLite error codes, and transforms any error corresponding to a duplicate author into the domain's preferred representation .Of course, , not being part of the domain's Garden of Eden, may encounter an error that the domain can't do much with .This is a 500 Internal Server Error in the making, but repositories shouldn't know about HTTP status codes. We need to pass it back up the chain in the form of CreateAuthorError::Unknown, both to inform the end user that something fell over, and to capture for debugging.This is a situation that the program – or at least the request handler – can't recover from. Couldn't we ? The domain can't do anything useful here, so why not skip the middleman and let the panic recovery middleware handle it?Until very recently, I would have said yes – if the domain can't do any useful work with an error, panicking will save you from duplicating error handling logic between your request handler and your panic-catching middleware.However, thanks to  and a horrible realization I had in the shower, I've reversed my position.Whether or not you consider the database falling over a recoverable error, there are two incontrovertible reasons not to panic:Panicking poisons held mutexes. If your application state is protected by an , panicking while you hold the guard will mean no other thread will ever be able to acquire it again. Your program is dead, and no amount of panic recovery middleware will bring it back.Other Rust devs won't expect you to panic. Most likely, you won't be the person woken at 3am to debug your code. Strive to make it as unsurprising as possible. Follow established error handling conventions diligently. Return errors, don't panic.What about retry handling? Good question. We'll cover that in .Everything but the kitchen asyncHave you spotted it? The mismatch between our repository implementation and the trait definition.Ok, you caught me. I simplified the definition of . There's actually more to it, because of course we want database calls to be async.Writing to a file or calling a database server is precisely the kind of slow, blocking IO that we don't want to stall on.We need to make  an async trait. Unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as writingRust understands this, and it will compile, but probably won't do what you expect.Although writing  will cause your method's return value to be sugared into Future<Output = Result<Author, CreateAuthorError>>, it  get an automatic  bound.As a result, your future can't be sent between threads. For web applications, this is useless.Let's spell things out for the compiler!Since our  and  are both , a  that wraps them can be too .But what good is a repository if its methods return thread-safe s, but the repo itself is bound to a single thread? Let's ensure  is  too.Ugh, we're not done. Remember about 4,000 words ago when we wrapped our application state in an  to inject into an HTTP handler? Well, trust me, we did. requires its contents to be both  and  to be either  itself!  on the topic if you'd like to know more.Your instinct might now be to implement  for  instead of , since  is immutable and therefore . However, sqlx's connection pools are themselves , meaning  is too.Naturally, if we're shuffling a repo between threads, Rust wants to be sure it won't be dropped unexpectedly. Let's reassure the compiler that every  will live for the whole program:Finally, our web server, axum, requires injected data to be , giving our final trait definition:From the Very Bad Application to the merely Bad ApplicationIt's time to start putting these pieces together. Let's reassemble our  HTTP handler to take advantage of the  abstraction.First, the definition of , which is the struct that contains the resources that should be available to every HTTP handler. This pattern should be familiar to users of both  and . is now generic over . That is,  provides HTTP handlers with access to "some store of author data", giving them the ability to create authors without knowledge of the implementation.We wrap whatever instance of  we receive in an , because axum is going to share it between as many async tasks as there are requests to our application.This isn't our final destination – eventually our HTTP handler won't even know it has to save something (ah, sweet oblivion).We're not quite there yet, but this is a vast improvement. Check out the handler!Doesn't your nervous system feel calmer to behold it?Go on, take some deep breaths. Enjoy the moment.  if you need a reminder.Ok, the walkthrough.  has access to an , which it makes good use of. But first, it converts the raw CreateAuthorHttpRequestBody it received from the client into the holy domain representation . Here's how:Nothing fancy! Boilerplatey, you might think. This is by design. We have preemptively decoupled the HTTP API our application exposes to the world from the internal domain representation.As you scale, you will thank this so-called boilerplate. You will name your firstborn child for it.These two things can now change independently. Changing the domain doesn't necessarily force a new web API version. Changing the HTTP request structure does not require any change to the domain. Only the mapping in CreateAuthorHttpRequestBody::into_domain and its corresponding unit tests get updated.This is a very special property. Changes to transport concerns or business logic no longer spread through your program like wildfire. Abstraction has been achieved.Thanks to the pains we took to define all the errors an  is allowed to return, constructing an HTTP response is dreamy. In the error case, we map seamlessly to a serializable  using :If the author was found to be a duplicate, it means the client's request was correctly structured, but that the contents were unprocessable. Hence, we're aiming to respond .Important detail alert! Do you see how we're manually building an error message at , even though CreateAuthorError::to_string could have produced this error for us?This is another instance of aggressive decoupling of our transport concern (JSON over HTTP) from the domain. Returning full-fat, unpasteurised domain errors to users is an easy way to leak private details of your application. It also results in unexpected changes to HTTP responses when domain implementation details change!If we get an error the domain didn't expect – CreateAuthorError::Unknown here – that maps straight to .The finer points of how you log the underlying cause will vary according to your needs. Crucially, however, the error itself is not exposed to the end user.Finally, our success case . We take a reference to the returned  and transform it into its public API counterpart. It gets sent on its way with status .Testing HTTP handlers with injected repositoriesPreviously, our handler code was impossible to unit test, because we needed a real database instance to call them. Trying to exercise every failure mode of a database call with a real database is pure pain.Those days are over. By injecting any type that implements , we open our HTTP handlers to unit testing with mock repositories. is defined to hold the  it should return in response AuthorRepository::create_author calls .The rather nasty type signature at  is due to the fact that  has a  bound, which means  must be .Unfortunately for us,  isn't , because its  variant contains .  isn't  since it's designed to wrap unknown errors, which may not be  themselves.  is one common non- error.Rather than passing  a convenient Result<Author, CreateAuthorError>, we need to give it something cloneable – .

I leave the error case to your powerful imagination, but if you crave more Rust testing pearls, I'll have a comprehensive guide to unit testing for you soon!At , we construct a  with an arbitrary success . We expect that a  from the repo should produce a Result::Ok(ApiSuccess<CreateAuthorResponseData>) from the handler .This situation is simple to set up – we just call the  handler with a  object constructed from the  in place of a real one . The assertions are self-explanatory.I know, I know – you're itching to see what  looks like with these improvements, but we're about to take a much bigger and more important leap in our understanding of hexagonal architecture.In Part III, coming next, I'll introduce you to the beating heart of an application domain: the .We'll ratchet up the complexity of our example application to understand how to set domain boundaries. We'll confront the tricky problem of  through the lens of authentication, and explore the interface between hexagonal applications and distributed systems.And yes, we'll finally answer, "why hexagons?".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One man&apos;s march to bring reconciliation to Bosnia and Herzegovina | Focus on Europe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD_d-xK6mzg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/sD_d-xK6mzg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:30:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Josip Jelinic plans to walk 1,000 kilometers through Bosnia and Herzegovina to promote reconciliation between the ethnic groups.

As I was trying out everything, I noted down the quirks of all the techniques out there on the Internet.The issue here is that there are two kinds of problems with this particular WLAN adapter: the disconnection problem and the network speed problem. In my case, I'll be mainly dealing with the disconnection problem, but in case anyone knows about the network problem (especially how to implement Roaming Aggressiveness in Linux), then I'll cover it in a separate post. Experts are encouraged to chime in :)A simple note that some of these methods might work in one distro, but not for the other ones. However, I'll only be stating the ones which worked for me in Fedora 41 & 42.In your terminal, open this file/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave.conf using whatever editor you prefer. (Neovim or Nano or Emacs or whatever)Write this down or change it appropriately:[connection] wifi.powersave=2 Restart your computer after that.For me, it absolutely didn't work. The wlp1s0 network interface was disappearing as a whole.This one might not actually work because linux-firmware has already merged the last commit, so this might not be the fix.At first, check if this is the file tree:/lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377 ├── firmware-6.bin.xz └── hw1.0 ├── board-2.bin ├── board-2.bin.xz ├── board.bin ├── board.bin.xz ├── CNSS.TF.1.0 ├── firmware-5.bin.xz ├── firmware-6.bin.xz ├── firmware-sdio-5.bin.xz ├── notice_ath10k_firmware-5.txt.xz ├── notice_ath10k_firmware-6.txt.xz -> ../../QCA6174/hw3.0/notice_ath10k_firmware-6.txt.xz ├── notice_ath10k_firmware-sdio-5.txt.xz -> notice_ath10k_firmware-5.txt.xz ├── untested ├── WLAN.TF.1.0 └── WLAN.TF.2.1 You just need to ensure that there is content within this  directory; it's optional for the files to match.Click on the Code icon in blue, then scroll down to "Download this directory". Under that section, you can download in any format.Download that archive, then extract it.Through your terminal, use  to go to the folder where you have extracted it all.Go to the directory/folder named . Under that directory, there will only be one item called .While being under this  directory in the terminal, as a protective measure, write ls /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/. Check if there's only  or not.Press the up arrow, then replace thatwith  . Then it becomessudo cp -rv * /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/.Press Enter. Wait for the files to go.Just so you know, it didn't work in this case.3) Copying firmware files (didn't work but this can fix your issue)As usual, check what ls /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/hw1.0/ leads to. What are the names of the firmware files?I think you guys have seen it... the names are like firmware-6, firmware-5. Basically, the one with the highest number is the one being run.Suppose N is the highest number. Then, you will use cd /lib/firmware/ath10k/QCA9377/hw1.0/ .Notice the file you see resembling firmware-N.whatever.extensions . Copy it to the parent directory. In simpler terms: sudo cp -v firmware-N.whatever.extensions ..Even this one didn't quite work. At first, it could resolve the network interface disappearance issue for some time. I even attended a class through Google Meet. But just after classes ended, I used Suspend/S3 Sleep. After waking, the Wi-Fi wasn't working at all, just like the previous solutions. On a different note, you guys can try this out if you can make a startup script with root access (but this might be tedious): https://github.com/pop-os/pop/issues/1470#issuecomment-20291191164) ath10k-custom.conf (hyphen) and ath10k_core.conf (underscore) (Read it carefully, skip_otp is an important aspect after all)At first, I tried to create ath10k-custom.conf. That's what helped someone in the previous post. However, my problems were resolved ONLY after wrting ath10k_core.conf.Just execute these commands ONCE and you'll be fine. Note that the following commands are case-sensitive.For ath10k-custom.conf: echo -e "options ath10k_core skip_otp=y\noptions ath10k_core rawmode=0" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/ath10k-custom.confFor ath10k_core.conf: echo "options ath10k_core skip_otp=y" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/ath10k_core.confRestart your PC after executing the first command, and after executing the second command (basically twice).I have tried my best to propose all the solutions to this problem I could find, and now I'm tired. It's already 3:58 AM. To the firmware/NetworkManager experts, it'd be a pleasure for me to know how can roaming aggressiveness be increased. To the normal users, in case you find anything problematic, you can ask me in the comments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Could AI and Automation Find Better Treatments for Cancer - and Maybe Aging?</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/04/19/0336255/could-ai-and-automation-find-better-treatments-for-cancer---and-maybe-aging?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 22:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[CNN looks at "one field that's really benefitting" from the use of AI: "the discovery of new medicines". 


The founder/CEO of London-based LabGenius says their automated robotic system can assemble "thousands of different DNA constructs, each of which encodes a completely unique therapeutic molecule that we'll then test in the lab. This is something that historically would've had to have been done by hand." In short, CNN says, their system lets them "design and conduct experiments, and learn from them in a circular process that creates molecular antibodies at a rate far faster than a human researcher." 
While many cancer treatments have debilitating side effects, CNN notes that LabGenius "reengineers therapeutic molecules so they can selectively target just the diseased cells."
 But more importantly, their founder says they've now discovered "completely novel molecules with over 400x improvement in [cell] killing selectivity." 

A senior lecturer at Imperial College London tells CNN that LabGenius seems to have created an efficient process with seamless connections, identifying a series of antibodies that look like they can target cancer cells very selectively "that's as good as any results I've ever seen for this." (Although the final proof will be what happens when they test them on patients..) "And that's the next step for Labgenius," says CNN. "They aim to have their first therapeutics entering clinics in 2027." 

Finally, CNN asks, if it succeeds is their potential beyond cancer treatment? "If you take one step further," says the company's CEO/founder, "you could think about knocking out senescent cells or aging cells as a way to treat the underlying cause of aging."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A full data pipeline in Rust to explore how politicians use words</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1k37v1v/a_full_data_pipeline_in_rust_to_explore_how/</link><author>/u/sufjanfan</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>rust</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 22:18:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've built a little tool that allows you to search through transcripts of the most recent session of the Canadian House of Commons to generate breakdowns of how often members of parliament use your search term by party, gender, province, etc. Check it out here!It started with a very basic web scraper to download the Hansard transcripts in HTML format - didn't even need selenium. From there I populated a MariaDB database of MPs and other speakers mostly manually, and built a hacky translator to convert the transcripts into speech strings with a time and matchable name attached.I hadnt scoped out the project much by that point and was just going to poke through the numbers myself with some SQL, but I had the silly idea to make it accessible through a web app, so I threw together an axum server and a frontend with yew and plotters. I added a few more graphs and features, jazzed up the style a bit, and tried to make the backend not waste too much processing time.Eventually I'd like to have the scraper and translator work in a live pipeline to keep this thing updating as the house sits again after our election coming up. A time series selector, or at least a session selector, would be a good add in that case.If you're a statistician you're probably horrified at this point, but I'm having fun and I think there's something worthwhile to play around with here even if none of this is rigorous enough to draw hard conclusions.

But the one place where this radical turn towards simplicity has presented challenges are file managers.Back years ago in my Windows days, I used to us Directory Opus and loved it, but none of the third party file managers really stuck with me on Linux.

The selection is extensive, and I use the following the most:copy filepath to clipboard (the path box doesn't contain name of the specific file, this lets me yoink the path and the file name in one go)paste from clipboard as a file (paste text directly into a file, without needing to create the file first)list the largest files/directoriescombine multiple PDFs into one (great for merging multiple PDFs into one before feeding it to my document storage solution)optimise PDFs/images for webstrip exif data via ExifToolverify checksum files (to verify my linux .isos, naturally)convert webps to pngs/jpgspaste as hard links (recursively paste whole folder as hard links, equivalent of , my MVP)permanently delete via git operations, especially pullThere are a bunch more too.

Task and Annotation Reliability. We first assess the reliability of the label assignment task and the human annotations by involving multiple human annotators and calculating the interrater agreement (Cohen’s Kappa [6] between two raters and Fleiss’ Kappa [7] among multiple raters). We then resolve disagreements between human annotations by either voting or deliberation, and obtain a consensus human annotation for each instance. Then we use an LLM as an additional annotator to perform the same label assignment task, and measure the agreement between the LLM annotation and the consensus human label. Intuitively, this agreement captures how well the LLM is aligned with (the majority of) human annotators and how reliable it is for this label assignment task.\
 We apply both human and LLM annotations on a small-scale corpus sample and calculate the conventional multiclass and multilabel classification metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1) with human annotations as the ground truth. These metrics evaluate how the label classifier is aligned with human preferences on a small subset of the corpus. We then apply the LLM annotator on a larger-scale corpus sample and leverage the resulting annotations as the oracle to calculate the same classification metrics. These metrics enable a comprehensive diagnosis of the label classifier performance at scale on different aspects of the corpus, such as domains, languages, and time ranges.\
In practice, we recommend leveraging both human evaluation and LLM-based metrics as a holistic evaluation suite, while also taking into account the task and annotation reliability. This approach can help us identify and mitigate the possible bias that may arise from either method or be affected by the task complexity, and enable us to scale up the evaluation and annotation to a large corpus sample with confidence, thus obtaining more robust and informative evaluation results.(1) Mengting Wan, Microsoft Corporation and Microsoft Corporation;(2) Tara Safavi (Corresponding authors), Microsoft Corporation;(3) Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Microsoft Corporation;(4) Yujin Kim, Microsoft Corporation;(5) Scott Counts, Microsoft Corporation;(6) Jennifer Neville, Microsoft Corporation;(7) Siddharth Suri, Microsoft Corporation;(8) Chirag Shah, University of Washington and Work done while working at Microsoft;(9) Ryen W.

Thousands of protesters joined a rally here in Washington D.C., with hundreds of other protests planned for across the country. Among other things, demonstrators are angry about Trump's immigration crackdown, economic uncertainty from sweeping tariffs, and Trump slashing the federal workforce. Millions joined similar protests earlier this month.

Meantime, the US Supreme Court has responded to an emergency appeal and ordered the Trump administration to halt any further deportations of Venezuelan migrants. The White House had invoked a law from 1798 to round up and remove those they identified as gang members. Trump officials have already defied earlier court orders to reign in their campaign to deport migrants.

But "In order for Mars to be warm enough to host liquid water, there must have been a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere," says Benjamin Tutolo, a researcher at the University of Calgary. "The question we've been asking for at least 30 years was where the record of all this carbon is."


Tutolo led a new study of rock samples collected by the Curiosity rover that might have answered this question... 

Curiosity rover was called Mars Science Laboratory for a reason. It went to the red planet fitted with a suite of instruments, some of which even the newer Perseverance was lacking. These enabled it to analyze the collected Martian rocks on the spot and beam the results back to Earth. "To get the most bang for the buck, NASA decided to send it to the place on Mars called the Gale Crater, because it was the tallest stack of sediments on the planet," Tutolo says. The central peak of Gale Crater was about 5 kilometers tall, created by the ancient meteorite impact... The idea then was to climb up Mount Sharp and collect samples from later and later geological periods at increasing elevations, tracing the history of habitability and the great drying up of Mars. 

On the way, the carbon missed by the satellites was finally found... 

It turned out the samples contained roughly between 5 and 10 percent of siderite... The siderite found in the samples was also pure, which Tutolo thinks indicates it has formed through an evaporation process akin to what we see in evaporated lakes on Earth. This, in turn, was the first evidence we've found of the ancient Martian carbon cycle. "Now we have evidence that confirms the models," Tutolo claims. The carbon from the atmosphere was being sequestered in the rocks on Mars just as it is on Earth. The problem was, unlike on Earth, it couldn't get out of these rocks... A large portion of carbon that got trapped in Martian rocks stayed in those rocks forever, thinning out the atmosphere.
 
"While it's likely the red planet had its own carbon cycle, it was an imperfect one that eventually turned it into the lifeless desert it is today," the article points out. 

But the study still doesn't entirely explain what warmed the atmosphere of Mars — or why Martian habitability "was seemingly intermittent and fluctuating".]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built an AI that turns GitHub codebases into easy tutorials</title><link>https://github.com/The-Pocket/Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge</link><author>zh2408</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 21:04:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zoo animals hunt Easter-themed treats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBrpX2v-ZSc</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZBrpX2v-ZSc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 21:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Animals at Whipsnade Zoo in England were treated to an Easter-themed hunt, as keepers decorated their enclosures with props and boxes for the upcoming holiday.

In a move that will likely force IT to much more aggressively use web certificate automation services, the Certification Authority Browser Forum (CA/Browser Forum), a gathering of certificate issuers and suppliers of applications that use certificates, voted [last week] to radically slash the lifespan of the certificates that verify the ownership of sites. 

The approved changes, which passed overwhelmingly, will be phased in gradually through March 2029, when the certs will only last 47 days. 

This controversial change has been debated extensively for more than a year. The group's argument is that this will improve web security in various ways, but some have argued that the group's members have a strong alternative incentive, as they will be the ones earning more money due to this acceleration... Although the group voted overwhelmingly to approve the change, with zero "No" votes, not every member agreed with the decision; five members abstained... 

In roughly one year, on March 15, 2026, the "maximum TLS certificate lifespan shrinks to 200 days. This accommodates a six-month renewal cadence. The DCV reuse period reduces to 200 days," according to the passed ballot. The next year, on March 15, 2027, the "maximum TLS certificate lifespan shrinks to 100 days. This accommodates a three-month renewal cadence. The DCV reuse period reduces to 100 days." And on March 15, 2029, "maximum TLS certificate lifespan shrinks to 47 days. This accommodates a one-month renewal cadence. The DCV reuse period reduces to 10 days."
 
The changes "were primarily pushed by Apple," according to the article, partly to allow more effective reactions to possible changes in cryptography. 

And Apple also wrote that the shift "reduces the risk of improper validation, the scope of improper validation perpetuation, and the opportunities for misissued certificates to negatively impact the ecosystem and its relying parties."

Valkey is backed by the Linux Foundation, Google, Amazon Web Services, and Oracle, which the article points out is due to Redis's decision last year to shift the upstream Redis license from a BSD 3-clause to RSALv2 and SSPLv1.


Valkey is replacing Redis in the Arch Linux extra repository and after a two week period the Redis package will be moved out to AUR and receive no further updates. Users are encouraged to migrate to Valkey as soon as possible.

(Check Benchmarks)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/which-ai-model-should-you-use-check-benchmarks?source=rss</link><author>Rutkat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 17:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There are more AI models than what you see in the news and on social media. There are hundreds, including open-source models, private ones, and the tech giant’s own: Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, Grok, Deepseek. What is a model really? Is it just a block box of data? Almost! You can think of it as a zip file of the internet with a bit of C++ code that communicates with the zip file. I credit this analogy to Andrej Karpathy, although I’m not sure if it was his idea, but he is the real industry expert.\
An AI model is a neural network utilizing a set of massive data to recognize specific patterns. Now is the time to take advantage of them and choose wisely whether for business, personal assistance, or creativity enhancement. The objective of this guide is not about “model training”; it is geared for individuals new to the field of AI who want a better understanding and to leverage the technology. You can build with AI, not over it, so after reading this guide, the knowledge gained shall be understanding general concepts, usage, and measuring accuracy.\
In this AI guide, you will learn the following, so you can skip to any section, but if you’re a beginner, read this entire article:Corresponding Tasks of ModelsNaming Convention of ModelsAccuracy Performance of Models\
As a beginner or just hearing about the popular tools, make note that there isn’t one type, multi-use case model that does everything you ask it to do. From the interface, it may appear that you are just typing to a chatbot, but there is a lot more being executed in the background. Business analysts, product managers, and engineers adopting AI can identify the objective they have and select from a category of AI models.\
Here are 4 categories of models among many:Natural Language Processing (general)Generative (Image, Video, Audio, Text, Code)Discriminative (Computer Vision, Text Analysis)\
While most models specialize in one category, others are multi-modal with different levels of accuracy. Every model has been trained on specific data and, therefore, can do specific tasks related to the data it was trained on. Here’s a list of common tasks each category of models can do:Natural Language ProcessingEnables computers to interpret, understand, and generate natural human language using tokenization and statistical models. Examples are chatbots, and the most common one is ChatGPT, which stands for “generative pre-trained transformer”. Most models are actually pre-trained transformers.Generative (Image, Video, Audio, Text, Code)They are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which use two sub-models known as a generator and a discriminator. Realistic imagery, audio, text, and code can be produced based on tons of data it was trained on. Stable Diffusion is the most popular method of generating images and videos.Discriminative (Computer Vision, Text Analysis)These use algorithms designed to learn different classes of datasets for decision-making. They include sentiment analysis, optical recognition, and sentiment analysis.Using trial-and-error methods and human enforcement to produce goal-oriented outcomes, such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving.Naming Convention of ModelsNow that you understand the types of models and their tasks, the next step is to identify the model quality and performance. This begins with the name of the models. Let’s break down a model naming. There’s the official convention for naming AI models, but the most popular ones will just have a name followed by the version number, such as chatGPT#, Claude #, Grok #, Gemini #. \
However, the smaller open-source and task-specific models will have longer names. This can be seen on huggingface.co, which will contain the organization name, model name, parameter size, and lastly the context size.\
Let’s elaborate with examples:\
mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2053Mistralai is the organizationMistral-Small is the model name3.1 is the version number24B-Instruct is the parameter count in billions of training data2053 is the context size or token countGoogle is the organization27B is the parameter size in billions\
Additional details, which you will see and need to know, are the quantization format in bits. The higher the quantization format, the more computer RAM and storage are required to operate the model. A quantization format is represented in floating point, such as 4, 6, 8, and 16. Other formats can include GPTQ, NF4, and GGML, which indicate usage for specific hardware configurations.\
The real way to determine model quality is to check benchmark scores and leaderboards. There have been several tests which you could say are semi-standardized or maybe fully standardized, but in reality, we are testing “black boxes” with tons of variables. The best measure is to check answers and responses from AI with facts and other scientific sources.\
Leaderboard websites will show sortable rankings with votes, confidence interval scores, usually in a percentage value. The common benchmarks are tests that prompt the AI model with questions and get answers that are measured. They can include: AI2 Reasoning Challenge, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, WinoGrande, GSM8K, HumanEval.\
Here are brief descriptions of the benchmarking methods:\
AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) – 7787 multiple-choice science questions from grade school – commonsense reasoning exercises through sentence completion – Massive multitask language understanding for problem solving – assess truthfulness by encouraging falsehoods and avoiding responses like “I’m not sure”. – Winograd schema challenge with two near-identical sentences based on a trigger word – 8,000 grade school level math questions – measures the ability to generate correct Python code across 164 challenges\

Panel 2: “From abuse of underpaid labour in post-colonial settings to the objectification of people’s lives and work as ‘data’ to the extraction of rare minerals to power increasingly demanding computational needs, AI runs not on sci-fi futuristic utopia but on the appropriation of today’s world’s material and human resources.”\
Panel 3: “It can feel like we’re living in end-times for artists when AI, trained on images without consent from their creators, can conjure up new images within seconds.”\
Panel 4: “But our hope is to use illustration to hold PEOPLE and the decisions they’ve made through AI and other forms of technology accountable.”Copy Editing and Production]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Breaking: Putin announced unilateral Easter truce for Ukraine | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7X3cZ1wH2w</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H7X3cZ1wH2w?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 17:07:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a unilateral Easter truce for the war in Ukraine.

They accept circumstances as "just the way things are." They assume industries can't be disrupted. They believe systems are too entrenched to change. They see barriers as permanent rather than temporary.\
This mindset isn't just wrong. It's the single biggest limitation keeping you from creating the life, business, and impact you're capable of.\
Mark Andreessen, the founder of Netscape and a legendary Silicon Valley venture capitalist, captured this perfectly:\
"The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think."\
This isn't just inspirational fluff. It's a fundamental truth about how reality actually works.\
And once you understand it, everything changes.The Reality Distortion Field Is RealWhen Steve Jobs told his team the impossible needed to be done in five weeks rather than five months, they pushed back hard.\
It couldn't be done. The timeline was unrealistic. The limitations were too great.\
Jobs didn't budge. "Don't be afraid," he said. "You can do it."\
This happened so often that his team coined a term for it: the "reality distortion field." They meant it as a joke – Jobs' ability to convince people that the impossible was possible through sheer force of will.\
But here's what they missed: The distortion wasn't in Jobs' mind. It was in everyone else's.\
Jobs simply understood that most "impossible" things are merely difficult things no one has been stubborn enough to solve yet.\
What his team viewed as bending reality was actually just refusing to accept artificial limitations.\
The world is far more malleable than most people realize. Not because of magic, but because the barriers we perceive are largely constructions built from:Outdated assumptions that no one has challengedArtificial constraints that exist only through collective agreementLimiting beliefs about what's possible or permissible\
When you push against these barriers with enough force, they often dissolve more easily than you'd expect.Your Permission Isn't RequiredYou've been waiting for permission.\
Whether you realize it or not, there's something you want to build, create, or pursue – but you've been holding back until someone gives you the green light.\
You're not alone. Most people wait their entire lives for permission.\
Permission to start. Permission to lead. Permission to challenge the status quo.\
They assume success comes from following established paths and hitting predetermined milestones. Get the degree. Build the resume. Pay your dues. Wait your turn.\
But the people who reshape industries don't wait for permission. They take action while others are still waiting to be called on.\
Sara Blakely didn't ask the male-dominated undergarment industry if she could revolutionize shapewear. She just cut the feet off her pantyhose and created Spanx.\
Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia didn't ask hotel chains if they could turn spare bedrooms into accommodations. They just put air mattresses on their floor and created Airbnb.\
What would you do differently tomorrow if you stopped waiting for someone to tell you it's okay to proceed?\
Think about it. Really think. What idea, project, or career move would you immediately pursue?\
The most dangerous form of self-deception is believing that you need someone else's approval or authorization to pursue your vision.\
The world is malleable, but only for those willing to start reshaping it without an engraved invitation.The Muscle Behind MalleabilityAndreessen's quote contains a critical qualifier that most people miss.\
He doesn't say the world bends for anyone with a wish or a hope. He specifically says it reconfigures for those who pursue what they want "with maximum energy and drive and passion."\
This isn't about magical thinking. It's about applied force.\
Reality has inertia. It resists change. But that resistance isn't infinite – it's just enough to filter out the uncommitted.\
This filtering mechanism is actually a feature, not a bug. It ensures that the world only reconfigures around those who care enough to push through initial resistance.\
When Jan Koum was building WhatsApp, he was rejected by Facebook for a job. Five years later, Facebook acquired his company for $19 billion.\
The difference wasn't luck. It was persistence applied to a clear vision.\
The world tests your commitment before it yields. It asks: How badly do you want this? What are you willing to sacrifice? How long can you persist when results aren't immediate?\
Your answers to these questions determine whether reality will reconfigure around you or remain stubbornly fixed.\
Look at your current projects. Where are you applying casual effort and expecting significant results? Where have you backed off at the first sign of resistance?\
This isn't about judgment. It's about clarity. The path you're on right now is giving you exactly the results your current energy level deserves.The Paradox of ResistanceHere's something counterintuitive about how reality bends: Resistance isn't evidence that you're going in the wrong direction. Often, it's confirmation you're pushing on something worth changing.\
Think about it. If what you're attempting would make no meaningful difference, the world wouldn't bother to resist. Systems only defend themselves against genuine threats to the status quo.\
The pushback you're experiencing might be the strongest validation that you're onto something significant.\
I was struck by this when studying Richard Branson's early days building Virgin Atlantic. Every established airline and industry expert told him he would fail. Regulations were designed to keep newcomers out. Existing players actively worked to block his entry.\
This wasn't just bad luck. It was the system protecting itself.\
Had Branson interpreted this resistance as a sign he was on the wrong path, Virgin Atlantic would never have existed.\
What resistance are you facing right now that you've misinterpreted as a sign to retreat rather than advance?\
The obstacles in your path often aren't warnings. They're filters—separating those who want change from those who demand it.Most people never experience how malleable the world can be because they've internalized a fixed view of reality.\
This mental model creates a self-fulfilling prophecy:You believe change is extremely difficultThis belief reduces your effort and expectationsReduced effort leads to minimal resultsMinimal results confirm your original beliefThe cycle reinforces itself\
The highest price you pay for seeing the world as fixed isn't the opportunities you miss – it's the person you never become.\
When you believe fundamental change is nearly impossible, you naturally dial back your ambitions. You "be realistic." You set "achievable goals." You focus on small improvements rather than a big vision.\
This approach guarantees you'll never discover what's actually possible.\
The alternative isn't delusion. It's calculated boldness – testing assumptions about what can be changed rather than accepting them as fixed truths.3If the world is truly malleable, is there a formula for bending it to your vision?\
Based on studying those who've successfully reshaped reality, a pattern emerges:Vague intentions produce vague results. The world doesn't bend for fuzzy thinking.\
Those who successfully change reality can clearly state exactly what they want. Not just the outcome, but the reasoning, the values, and the non-negotiables.\
This clarity focuses their energy. Rather than splitting effort across many targets, they concentrate on specific points that matter.The world pushes back against anyone trying to change it. This resistance filters out the casually interested from the truly committed.\
Those who successfully reshape reality maintain their conviction despite setbacks, skepticism, and slow progress.\
This isn't blind stubbornness. It's a belief based on insight – seeing possibilities others miss because you've thought more deeply about the problem.3. Disproportionate ActionThe degree to which reality bends correlates directly with the amount of force applied.\
Those who reshape their world don't just work hard – they work with an intensity that makes others uncomfortable. They take action at a pace and scale that seems excessive to outside observers.\
This doesn't mean burnout or hustle culture. It means focused effort on what actually matters, not spreading yourself thin across a hundred small tasks.Reality doesn't bend equally in all directions. It has weak spots – places where less force can create bigger change.\
Those who successfully reshape their world develop a sense for these opportunities. They position themselves where new trends, unmet needs, and their unique skills overlap.\
This lets them create impact far beyond their direct effort.No one bends reality entirely alone. Even the most determined individual has limits.\
Those who successfully reshape their world inspire others to join them. Their clarity, conviction, and action attract allies, resources, and opportunities.\
This turns personal force into team momentum.The Decision That Changes EverythingThe world has always been malleable to those willing to test its flexibility.\
From the Wright brothers proving flight was possible to Katherine Johnson calculating the mathematics that put humans on the moon. \
From Steve Jobs creating the smartphone to Greta Thunberg mobilizing millions for climate action.\
The people who reshape reality aren't fundamentally different from you. They've simply made a different decision about what's possible and what's worth pursuing with maximum energy.\
This decision is available to you right now.\
You can choose to see barriers as fixed or flexible. You can choose to accept conditions or challenge them. You can choose to work within existing frameworks or create new ones.\
Your perception of what's changeable directly determines what you can change.\
The greatest revolution isn't external but internal – the moment you realize that many of the limitations you've accepted exist only because everyone agrees they exist.The Malleable Future Waiting For YouSo, where should you apply this understanding that the world is more flexible than it appears?\
Start with the constraints you've internalized as fixed:"The market is too crowded for new entrants.""I don't have the right background or connections.""This problem is too complex to solve quickly.""That's just how this industry works."\
Each of these beliefs deserves scrutiny. Not blind rejection, but careful examination. Is this truly an immovable reality, or simply a collective assumption no one has sufficiently challenged?\
Then ask yourself: What would I pursue if I truly believed Andreessen's observation that the world would reconfigure around my vision and energy?\
Not as a hypothetical exercise, but as a genuine question about what matters enough to warrant your maximum drive and passion.\
The answer might scare you. It should. Anything worth applying your full force toward should feel somewhat intimidating.\
But remember – the world is far more malleable than most people ever discover. The barriers that seem solid often dissolve when pushed against with enough determination.Your Next Step (The Only One That Matters)Theory without action is just entertainment.\
So, here's your immediate next step:\
Identify one "immovable" constraint in your business or life that you've been accepting without question. Just one.\
Tomorrow, take a specific action that assumes this constraint is flexible. It doesn't have to be dramatic – just a meaningful step that would make no sense if the limitation were truly fixed.\
Maybe it's reaching out to someone "unreachable." Perhaps it's setting a deadline that seems "impossible." Or proposing a solution others would call "unrealistic."\
This single action won't reshape your entire reality. But it will start training the most important muscle you have – your ability to test rather than accept the boundaries others take for granted.\
As Mark Andreessen reminds us, reality will reconfigure itself around you "much more quickly and easily than you would think."\
The only question is whether you'll test this truth or continue living as if the world is fixed.\
The choice is yours. And it changes everything.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Shout out to the blacks</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WPvRKNzgp4</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9WPvRKNzgp4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:33:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/</link><author>Julie Bort</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:09:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every now and then, a Silicon Valley startup launches with such an “absurdly” described mission that it’s difficult to discern if the startup is for real or just satire.

I Was on BreachForums.</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/where-were-you-when-the-world-shut-down-i-was-on-breachforums?source=rss</link><author>blackheart</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The day BreachForums went down, I was logged in.It was just another scroll through the usual: freshly dumped data, stolen credentials, drama between low-tier skids and ego-filled “veterans,” and whispers of big leaks coming soon. The forum had become a weird digital blend of marketplace, flex zone, and intelligence source. But underneath all the posturing, it was a pulse—one you learned to feel when you spent enough time watching the flow of stolen data from breach to sale. And then… silence.No splashy deface. No drawn-out farewell post. No FBI seizure page. At least not now anyway.This wasn’t the first time I experienced a BreachForums seizure. In the world of dark web research, I am in the “National Guard” of website search and seizures. It comes with the job description. All you need to do is follow a few simple rules, don’t be stupid, and you will be fine if a seizure happens. Speaking of seizures, I need to first tell you what BreachForums is and what it isn’t. Strap in, grab your favorite drink and get ready to hear some wild sh*t.Instead of the red pill, I took the sketchy-looking blue one.What was BreachForums? I am glad you asked, you curious little monkey you. BreachForums, sometimes referred to as Breached, is an English-language black hat–hacking crime forum. The website acted as an alternative and successor to RaidForums following its shutdown and seizure in 2022. Like its predecessor, BreachForums allows for the discussion of various hacking topics and distributed data breaches, pornography, hacking tools, and various other services.On March 21, 2023, BreachForums was shut down following the arrest of the forum's owner, Conor Brian Fitzpatrick. The forum was later reopened under the ownership of the hacking group ShinyHunters and the previous BreachForums administrator "Baphomet". Fitzpatrick was later sentenced to 20 years’ supervised release. The site was again shut down and the domain seized on May 15, 2024, though the domain was back under the owner's control just hours later.Something else that is suspicious is that BreachForums, along with other dark web forums, uses DDoS-Guard or Cloudflare for its web hosting services. You don’t believe me? Say hello to my little friend.I know it’s not impressive to find DNS records, but doesn’t it make you question how legitimate businesses protect websites like BreachForums, Doxbin, etc.? But that is for another article I am writing. Keep in mind, this wasn’t the first seizure of BreachForums and will not be the last.On June 23, 2023, three months after shutting down, the clearnet domains for BreachForums were seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice in accordance with a seizure warrant issued by the U.S. District Court for Eastern Virginia.Second seizure? Once wasn’t good enough?On May 15, 2024, the FBI seized the most recent BreachForums clearnet site along with its onion site and the associated Telegram. The seizure followed a significant data leak involving Europol's portal. The forum briefly displayed an FBI seizure notice, highlighting cooperation with international partners. The FBI is examining the forum's backend data, which may lead to identifying members and advancing investigations. The forum administrator, Baphomet, was arrested according to ShinyHunters. The site came back online on May 29, 2024.What could you find on BreachForums?To a dark web researcher, BreachForums was a melting pot of information on stolen data. You could literally watch the “Shout box” as threat actors discuss current or future data breaches. Having said that, it was one of the best places to go if you were looking for stolen data. Items such as:Data breaches were not the only items that were for sale or on display. If you were someone who wanted to disappear or gain initial access to a company, it was the place to go. All items were either for sale on Escrow, or you can purchase with credits from the forum. The one thing that BreachForums was good at was variety.Even though BreachFrorums was successful in being able to stay operational through all the seizures, it did have a lot of issues, but from within itself. Its own users and staff.The kids are not alright.You would think in the criminal underground of ill repute, it would be a free-for-all with no rules. You would be wrong. You would also think that a group of criminals who all have one thing in common would get along. You would also be wrong. Being a member of BreachForums is a lot like having an older brother or being in a fraternity. It’s messy, annoying, and like seeing your favorite Disney character in real life….disappointing.Paranoia was the main flavor when it came to BreachFroums. You might have well been a “Fed” because you would be accused of it more time than anything. Rightfully so because the rumor was, the feds were running the website after the first or second take down. Talk about pressure. Yet knowing this, the criminals were still active on the forum and selling stolen data like the very first “Thigh master”.It would also not be outlandish to see outrageous claims in the forums. I can’t count how many times I would see things that I didn’t believe, and coming from someone on a shady forum, it should be taken lightly. From a supposed DNC server attack to continued back-and-forth banter was the set tone most days on the forum.There was also the part when a criminal would brag about how they breached a company. I always knew they were talkative, but not at this level. Can you imagine watching someone tell you how they committed a crime with no strings attached? It would be a good time to wear your brown pants.Catching smoke with your hands.Since the forum’s takedown, there have been riddles in the dark and chatter about the arrest of IntelBroker. For those of you who don’t know, IntelBroker was one of the key players of the breach forum. If the rumors are true, it would be a huge win for the Justice Department. If it is not true, it will be embarrassing because this is the third takedown without anyone being arrested as IntelBroker.What do I know about IntelBroker? Not much. I never met him and only spoke to him once on the forum. It was for a ban appeal over “Leeching,”…which is exactly what I was doing anyway. That is all. He is someone who makes me wish I had multiple middle fingers. He was the first cybercriminal I have been following in hopes of helping bring to justice. I know I don’t know more than the FBI, but I have to help. Here is what I know so far:It’s not enough to help anyone, but that is how dark web research works. It’s a lot like fishing. You go out in hopes of catching something great, but sometimes, it doesn’t always go to plan. At least you show up, right?Now, there’s just fragmentation. Scattered chatter across platforms. More noise, less signal. The takedown didn’t kill the trade—it just pushed it into darker, quieter corners of the web. So, where was I when the world shut down? I was on BreachForums. Watching a chapter of internet history collapse in real time. Watching a torch fall—but knowing someone else would pick it up. Because in the world of breaches, nothing truly disappears. It just moves. Evolves. Hides better. And I’ll be there. Watching. Waiting. Writing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Camel racing in Egypt | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XrbCHQeSvk</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2XrbCHQeSvk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 16:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Boys strapped to camels’ backs race at breakneck speeds through the desert at dawn. Bedouins on dozens of pickup trucks follow them, cheering them on and trying to keep pace. Welcome to Zalaga!

The annual camel race in Zalaga, in the south of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, is one of the oldest and most famous in the world. For decades, this Bedouin tradition has been passed down from generation to generation. And every year, children are selected to ride the camels. Most of them come from impoverished backgrounds and hope the job will earn them some money. The film accompanies one of these boys as he prepares for the big race. Life in the desert is tough. The boys must rely on themselves: Far away from their families, they have little prospect of a decent education.

We therefore design a suite of strategies to evaluate . Our evaluation strategies may be categorized into three buckets, depending on the type and source of the evaluation criteria. The three categories are as follows:\
• Deterministic automatic evaluation: This type of approach is scalable and consistent, but requires well-defined, gold standard rules and annotations. It is less applicable for evaluating the abstract aspects studied in this paper, such as the quality and usefulness of a label taxonomy.\
 These approaches are useful for evaluating the abstract aspects that the automatic evaluations cannot address. However, they are also time-consuming, expensive, and may encounter data privacy and compliance constraints.\
 Here, LLMs are used to perform the same or similar tasks as human evaluators. This type of evaluation is more scalable and cost-effective than human evaluation, albeit potentially subject to biases and errors if not applied properly. We therefore aim to combine and validate LLM-based evaluation with human evaluation metrics on small corpora so that we can extrapolate conclusions with sufficient statistical power.4.1 Phase 1 Evaluation StrategiesFollowing prior studies [23, 30], we evaluate a label taxonomy on three criteria: Coverage, accuracy, and relevance to the use-case instruction. Note that we require implementing the native primary label assignment to apply these metrics. For clustering-based methods, this is instantiated through the clustering algorithm. For  this is done by a label assignment prompt as described in Section 3.2. We also note that the label accuracy and use-case relevance metrics discussed here are applicable to both  and  raters.\
 This metric measures the comprehensiveness of the generated label taxonomy for the corpus. Conventional text clustering approaches (e.g., embedding-based k-means) often achieve 100% coverage by design. In our LLM-based taxonomy generation pipeline, we add an ‘Other’ or ‘Undefined’ category in the label assignment prompt by design and measure the proportion of data points assigned to this category. The lower this proportion, the higher the taxonomy coverage.\
 This metric quantifies how well the assigned label reflects the text data point, relative to other labels in the same taxonomy. Analogous to mixture model clustering, the primary label should be the most probable one given the text. We assume human and LLM raters can assess the label fit by its name and description. We treat accuracy as a pairwise comparison task: for each text, we obtain the primary label and a random negative label from the same taxonomy, and ask a rater to choose the more accurate label based on their names and descriptions.[1] If the rater correctly identifies the positive label, we consider it as a "Hit" and report the average hit rate as the label accuracy metric. We do not explicitly evaluate the overlap across category labels and rather expect it to be implicitly reflected in the pairwise label accuracy metric.\
Relevance to Use-case Instruction. This metric measures how relevant the generated label taxonomy is to the use-case instruction. For example, “Content Creation” is relevant to an instruction to “understand user intent in a conversation”, while “History and Culture” is not. We operationalize this as a binary rating task: for each instance, we provide its primary label name and description to a human or LLM rater, and ask them to decide if the label is relevant to the given use-case instruction or not. Note that we instruct the rater to use the presented instance as the context, and rate the relevance conditioned on the label’s ability to accurately describe some aspect of the text input. The goal of this metric is not to evaluate the label accuracy, but rather to rule out the randomness introduced by taxonomies that are seemingly relevant to the use-case instruction, but irrelevant to the corpus sample – and therefore useless for downstream applications.[1] Raters are also offered a "None" option besides the pair, but are instructed to minimize the use of it.(1) Mengting Wan, Microsoft Corporation and Microsoft Corporation;(2) Tara Safavi (Corresponding authors), Microsoft Corporation;(3) Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Microsoft Corporation;(4) Yujin Kim, Microsoft Corporation;(5) Scott Counts, Microsoft Corporation;(6) Jennifer Neville, Microsoft Corporation;(7) Siddharth Suri, Microsoft Corporation;(8) Chirag Shah, University of Washington and Work done while working at Microsoft;(9) Ryen W.

Following that, the startup Monica gave me early access to Manus AI with plenty of free credits to play around with the AI agent.\
Now that I have first-hand experience, I can confirm, it really ups the game on the AI front.Its ability to define the checklist needed to take an objective to completion and perform one task after another to get there is breathtaking.\
So, the one big task I chose to perform with Manus AI was to high-level design a game where the player would live through Indian history by trying to build and defend cities.\
Manus had clear instructions — we would brainstorm to come up with the perfect gameplay, but then only code a minimally viable game.Instead, it tried to achieve the “objective” anyhow within a single execution — and we ended up with this landing page for the game it deployed on its own, rather than having an MVP of a gameplay.\
If you think, I could just ask it to refine and go back to what we were trying to do, uh oh, bad luck, we are all out of credits.\
So, I ended up blowing all of those fancy free credits Monica gave me, just so we could all learn this valuable lesson. We need a red button on AI.\
AI agents are all the rage. And I am very, very optimistic about them as somebody who is building multiple AI agents of my own.\
But, we need to acknowledge the negative side.\
That AI agents, even top-of-the-line ones, are not yet ready to perform complex tasks autonomously.\
This needs to be on the label.\
Because users can’t be expected to have blown up 100s (or even 1000s) of dollars before realizing this.\
This isn’t just a case with Manus AI, though. This is a similar problem I face from time to time with Cursor — my go-to AI agent for coding.\
Sometimes, it introduces unnecessary components or even new libraries, entirely different from what you are currently using, into your code.\
Take your eyes off what the agent is doing for a second, and you may just end up with a disaster of epic proportions.\
Now, to be fair, Cursor does have a “Reject All” button. But this only works if you review the code immediately.Many times, you may notice the issue after doing some more work on the code, and then a git rollback remains the only option.\
This isn’t to dissuade you from trying out AI agents (they really are the future), but just something I needed to say out loud, especially since I have contributed to the hype around them.\
AI agents are currently already a viable option to end-to-end code and deploy things like landing pages, classic games, and in-depth research on any given topic.\
I just want that button within reach on my desk that, when hit, just stops whatever task the AI is executing at a time, and just rolls the whole thing back.\

Why are ‘belief systems’ so powerful? How do they control religion and politics and all ways of thinking from a scientific worldview to conspiracy theories? What is a ‘belief system’? It is a set of tenets or convictions that support each other, such that the whole system governs individual beliefs. How we believe may be more important than what we believe.

Over 55 million people worldwide live with dementia, a number expected to rise to 139 million by 2050, with the greatest increases in low and middle-income countries where 60% of people affected by dementia already live.

Studies show that being part of a community, being physically active and eating healthily are some of the things that can help maintain the quality of life for dementia patients.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Rome earlier today. It's the second round of talks, following a meeting in Oman last weekend. Iran told the US it was ready to accept some limits on uranium enrichment, but needed strong guarantees that any deal would hold. 
Araghchi was in Russia on Friday, where he expressed skepticism over the intentions of the US, which scrapped a previous nuclear agreement signed during President Donald Trump's first term.

It contains traditional timing pages like a Driver Tracker, Timing Tower, Race Control, along with some more detailed analysis like lap and gap history, so that you can see strategies unfolding.I started to build undercutf1 almost two years ago, after becoming increasingly frustrated with the TV direction and lack of detailed information coming out of the live feed. Overtakes were often missed and strategies were often ill-explained or missed. I discovered that F1 live timing data is available over a simple SignalR stream, so I set out building an app that would let me see all the information I could dream of. Now undercutf1 serves as the perfect companion (like a second Martin Brundle) when I'm watching the sessions live.If you want to test it out, you replay the Suzuka race easily by downloading the timing data, then starting a simulated session:1. Download undercutf1 using the installation instructions in the README.2. Import the Suzuka race session data using `undercutf1 import 2025 -m 1256 -s 10006`.3. Start the app (`undercutf1`) then press S (Session) then F (Simulated Session), then select Suzuka then Race using the arrow keys, then press Enter.4. Use arrow keys to navigate between the timing pages, and use N / Shift+N to fast-forward through the session.If you want to test it out during this weekends Jeddah GP, simply install as in the README then start a live session by pressing S (Session) then L (Live Session).The app is built for a terminal of roughly 110x30 cells, which probably seems an odd size but just so happens to be the size of a fullscreen terminal on a MBP zoomed in far enough that the text is easily glanceable when the laptop is placed on a coffee table some distance away from me :) Other terminal sizes will work fine, but information density/scaling may not be ideal.If you're using the TUI during a live session, you'll want to synchronise the delay of the timing feed to your TV feed. Use the N/M keys to increase/decrease the delay. During non-race session, I find it fairly easy to sync the session clock on TV with the session clock on the bottom left of the timing screen. For race sessions, synchronisation is a little harder. I usually aim to sync the start of the race time (e.g. 13:00 on the timing screen clock) with the start of the formation lap, where the live feed helpfully shows the clock tick over to 0 minutes. I usually delay the feed by 30 to 60 seconds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The allegations against a billionaire&apos;s rubber company | Big Take #podcast</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyiTiSyOwis</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/YyiTiSyOwis?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 07:00:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On this week’s Big Take podcast, @SheridanAsia tells @sarahsholde about her investigation into the rubber and palm oil company Socfin – and why a new EU law could bring reforms http://apple.co/3YEgDW7]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Goldbach Conjecture up to 4*10^18+7*10^13</title><link>https://medium.com/@jay_gridbach/grid-computing-shatters-world-record-for-goldbach-conjecture-verification-1ef3dc58a38d</link><author>jay_gridbach</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 06:11:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new challenge to a 280-year-old unsolved mathematical problemI’ve achieved a new world record in verifying the Goldbach Conjecture, a famous unsolved problem in mathematics, by extending the verification up to 4 quintillion (4×10¹⁸) + 70 trillion (7×10¹³). This article introduces Gridbach, the grid computing system I developed for this computation.Check out my live grid computing system here:https://gridbach.comNo login is required. You can immediately see the computation results on both PC and mobile.I am @jay_gridbach, a freelance engineer and consultant based in Kanagawa, Japan. Currently, I work as a PreSales engineer at a company in Tokyo, while also developing web applications and my own services. Gridbach is a project I’ve been nurturing since my corporate days, and I’m thrilled to release it in April 2025.The Goldbach Conjecture, proposed by Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach in 1742, remains an unsolved problem in mathematics. Despite the efforts of numerous modern mathematicians, no one has proven it mathematically. The conjecture itself is simple enough for a middle school student to understand:“Every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers”4 = 2 + 26 = 3 + 3………1000000000001092576 = 1913 + 1000000000001090663…While it’s believed to be true, a mathematical proof for all even numbers is still elusive.In 2013, T. Oliveira e Silva from Portugal verified the conjecture up to 4×10¹⁸ using computers. This was the previous world record.https://sweet.ua.pt/tos/goldbach.htmlMy newly developed Gridbach system has slightly surpassed this record by adding 70 trillion to the verified range. I aim to push this further to 5 quintillion by increasing the number of participating machines and improving my algorithms. I’m not sure how to get this recognized as an official record, but I’m willing to write a paper if necessary. If anyone has insights on this, please let me know.Gridbach is a cloud-based distributed computing system accessible from any PC or smartphone.It requires no login or app installation. The high-performance WASM (WebAssembly) binary code is downloaded as browser content, enabling computation on the user’s browser.Each computation job covers a range of 100 million (50 million even numbers), taking about 5–10 seconds on a PC and 10–20 seconds on a smartphone.Inspired by SETI@home, I’ve aimed to create a system that anyone can easily join.My system uses a combination of high-performance WASM for efficient computation and a highly scalable JAMStack architecture.The challenges and lessons learned in choosing and setting up this stack are worth a separate post.The app is simple, offering two main features: running computations on your machine and viewing the collective results from all Gridbach users. It’s also mobile-friendly.For details on the dashboard data, please visit - https://app.gridbach.com/I define “Goldbach Ridge” as the maximum value of the smaller prime in the prime pairs satisfying the Goldbach Conjecture within a given range.While T. Oliveira e Silva refers to these as the smaller prime  in the Goldbach partition, I named them as “ridge” as graphing these looks like mountain peaks and cols.Oliveira e Silva al. discovered a large Goldbach ridge of 9781:Feel free to join in and see if you can find some bigger peaks! So far, 6421 is the largest one found on my system. Your top 30 Goldbach Peaks are displayed on the My Calculation screen.The core computation logic of mine is open-sourced as a Go command-line tool under the MIT license.https://github.com/nakatahr/gridbach-coreHere’s a snippet of the code. I’ve upgraded the Sieve of Eratosthenes to use bitwise operations on byte arrays for faster prime number generation, and optimized it for given ranges.I also plan to write a separate article about the computation algorithm.Thank you for reading! Please take 5 minutes to try the computation on gridbach.com. I aim to continue breaking records and improving the system, hoping to spark interest in mathematics and IT.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: INSANE One-click MCP AI Agent Hits the Market (4/19/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/4-19-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 06:10:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @zbruceli [ 5 Min read ]

Browse the archive here.\
What’s up, world? 🤓 I’m Ese Olumhense, one of the latest hires at The Markup. I’ll be reporting on government here: the ways federal, state, and local agencies are finding, vetting, and using new technologies. I’m fascinated by the ways these products are packaged and marketed to our leaders—and by the private companies making fortunes from public dollars.\
These interests meet in my first story for The Markup: a juicy look at Axon’s seemingly ongoing plans to develop Taser-equipped drones as a response to mass shootings. The company, which makes both Taser devices and body-worn cameras, boasts that its products are already used by more than 95 percent of state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States. Its CEO has proposed embedding weaponized drones in school classrooms, armed with surveillance cameras and microphones, to be used to incapacitate active shooters. (Yes, you read that right.)\
When Axon made this surprising announcement last year, three quarters of its ethics board—a panel of academics, attorneys, activists, and former law enforcement officials—resigned in protest, saying they had “lost faith in the company’s ability to be a responsible partner.” The explosive exodus halted the weaponized drone development program, Axon’s CEO said.\
But it didn’t kill it, folks, as our latest shows. Axon still appears to be moving forward with its armed drone plan. In July, the company acquired Sky-Hero, a company based in Belgium that manufactures drones and unmanned ground vehicles. Sky-Hero has already developed so-called “distraction” technology for some of its drones and rovers that produces the same sound pressure levels as a semiautomatic rifle, it said in the description of a YouTube video showing off the tech, acting as a “true non-lethal flashbang.”\
As you can read in the piece, I tracked down members of the former ethics advisory board to learn more about the implications of weaponizing drones. (Spoiler alert: there are M A N Y, including the obvious risks of physical harm and potential misuse.) I also spent lots of time reading through Axon statements, investor reports, patent documents, and even the book “The End of Killing,” written by Axon CEO Rick Smith.\
Ultimately, I also asked Axon how soon we could see Taser-equipped drones on the market. They still haven’t gotten back to me.\
A little bit more about me, since you’ve read this far: I am obsessed with creative approaches to investigative storytelling. Before I got to The Markup, for example, I used body-cam footage from companies like Axon to add dimension to my reporting on voting crimes investigations. Using those images and sound, obtained through public records requests, I was able to illustrate just how deeply these investigations stirred fear and chilled voters. \
Now, I’m looking at government and technology, and I would love your help. What are journalists missing here? I’m interested in how technology is pitched as a solution for issues not only in policing and our criminal legal system, but in schools, government workplaces, and emergency management capacities. I’d also love to hear more about how tech is changing public transportation, public housing, and our environment and infrastructure.\
There is near-unlimited latitude here: Almost all of us deal with government in some way, and corporations and their products seem to have an increasing say in how we’re governed. I recently had a conversation with Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, about how this affects policing, and he blew me away with the following: “Critical decisions about public safety are being decided by marketing departments.” !!!!!!!!\
I’m looking forward to reporting on tech in our collective interest. Please reach me if you have tips, thoughts, or leads that might be helpful. (Or if you’re a government employee and you want to say hello ☺️.) I’m at ese@themarkup.org, on Signal or Whatsapp at (917) 407-0635, and you can send me some snail mail at The Markup, P.O. Box 1103, New York., NY 10159.Copy Editing and Production]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.15-rc3 To Bring AMD Zen 5 Microcode Protection, Intel Bartlett Lake ID Addition</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-rc3-x86-Fixes</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 00:23:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Merged today ahead of the Linux 6.15-rc3 kernel test release on Sunday were the set of "x86 fixes" for the week.

MoonX is an on-chain smart trading tool designed specifically for MemeCoin investors, integrating features such as hot trend discovery, risk screening, smart money following, and trade optimization.\
The launch of MoonX marks BYDFi's official entry into the "Dual Engine Era" of both Centralized Exchange (CEX) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) platforms. In a highly competitive global crypto exchange market, BYDFi is one of the first to complete this platform upgrade.“Traditional exchanges are shifting from a competition based solely on trading speed and fees to a broader ecosystem competition,” said Michael, CEO of BYDFi, at the launch event. “The explosive growth of MemeCoins is driving a new wave of user growth. The future market leaders won’t just be those offering fast matching and low fees on CEXs, but platforms that can simultaneously link the on-chain ecosystem with user demand.”\
As the on-chain investment entry point, MoonX complements the main BYDFi platform (CEX) with a hybrid structure:\
This structural upgrade gives BYDFi a competitive advantage as CEX and DEXs increasingly merge in the future.Currently, MoonX is deeply integrated with two major ecosystems:  and , covering leading liquidity pools like Pump.fun, Raydium, and PancakeSwap, while supporting real-time tracking of over 500,000 MemeCoin assets.\
Key features of the product include:Fast Token Listing: API data exchange with platforms like Pump.fun to capture hot projects as liquidity pools are launched, exploiting trading time differences.Smart Risk Control: Multi-dimensional models evaluate token security (contract permissions, blacklists, token lock-up status, etc.), filtering out high-risk tokens.Smart Money Following: The system tracks millions of on-chain addresses, identifying whales and high-probability addresses, allowing users to copy trades with one click and easily share strategy profits.Trade Optimization: Built-in gas optimization algorithms and slippage control mechanisms ensure smooth transactions and cost control, even during peak times.\
For a long time, “complex processes” and “asset security risks” have been major concerns preventing ordinary users from participating in on-chain investments. MoonX’s mission is to reinvent the on-chain trading experience, allowing more people to participate in Web3 investments as easily as using an app-based exchange. With just a BYDFi account, users can instantly connect to the blockchain and trade the next trending Meme project before it takes off.Founded in 2020, BYDFi was recognized by Forbes as one of the "Top 10 Global Crypto Exchanges" and has been certified by major data platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The platform currently serves users in over 190 countries and regions, earning the trust of more than 1,000,000 users worldwide. BYDFi is committed to providing users with a world-class crypto trading experience.Support Email: cs@bydfi.comBusiness Partnerships: bd@bydfi.comMedia Inquiries: media@bydfi.comSenior Marketing Director:::tip

Spirituality requires consciousness because we need to be aware, and to be self-aware, in order to apprehend spirituality of any kind. But is there more to the relationship? Some make the extravagant claim that our human consciousness is somehow connected directly to a’ cosmic consciousness’? Can this make sense? If so, what would it mean?

The game embodies two of my favorite aspects of tabletop RPGs: strategic teamwork and memorable anecdotes. It does struggle to be fun when you're playing solo, but that feels like it's clearly the wrong way to play the tabletop-inspired, turn-based tactical RPG, which really only comes together when different minds are working together to coordinate their respective perks and customized deck of card-based abilities to strategically accomplish the task at hand.In Sunderfolk, each player takes control of one of six anthropomorphic heroes: an arcanist crow, a pyromancer axolotl, a ranger goat, a bard bat, a berserker polar bear, or a rogue weasel. After proving themselves capable bouncers in a tavern, the heroes band together to protect their home village, Arden, from a series of escalating threats and try to find a way to prevent the growing corruption of the magical tree that keeps everyone safe from the coming darkness. It's your typical run-of-the-mill fantasy setup, with would-be heroes rising to heed the call of adventure when no one else will, and for the first few hours, Sunderfolk doesn't do much to differentiate itself from contemporary stories.But then you get to really know the NPCs, and Sunderfolk's story starts to make its mark with its varied cast of characters, all of whom are voiced by actor Anjali Bhimani to replicate the experience of playing a tabletop adventure with a Game Master who is portraying all the non-hero characters. Bhimani does an incredible job adjusting the pitch, tone, accent, and speed of her voice to add a distinct flavor to every character, injecting a feeling of life into the narrative that makes it easy to love the heroes' allies and effortless to hate the villains. My friends and I were far more invested in saving the village and discovering what was going on upon meeting an adorable, one-armed penguin orphan named Amaia who was doing her best to keep Arden's mines running, especially once her cruel and lying uncle was introduced. We vowed to do everything to save the little bird (and desperately hoped her uncle would be revealed as the true big bad so that we'd have a chance to destroy him), and much of that emotional investment, as well as our feelings about the other characters, was derived from Bhimani's portrayal.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Bogotá to the Battlefield: LatAm startups are winning big in TechCrunch Startup Battlefield</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/from-bogota-to-the-battlefield-latam-startups-are-winning-big/</link><author>Isabelle Johannessen</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 18:26:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For startups around the world, the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield program offers unmatched exposure, credibility, and connections to scale their businesses.

Now that “AI” is the word for pretty much everything, it’s not a coincidence that the iGaming industry is among the first adopters.\
Accroding to Casinos Blockchain, the online gambling market will reach approximately $245.4 billion by the end of the calendar year, and AI is  to be “guilty” for a significant portion of that growth.What Makes AI Gambling Different?For many obvious reasons, you may wonder, ‘What’s common between casinos and artificial intelligence?’. Well, casinos nowadays use AI to analyze player habits – play frequency, game preferences, and even betting speed. Algorithms later recommend titles or offer bonuses made to “check” specific preferences, rather than shoot in the dark and “nailing the sweet spot” every now and then.\
To make it look simple, we can say that game recommendations function pretty much like Netflix suggestions – but for gambling. Those who prefer roulette could receive roulette-specific bonuses rather than the standard promotions (which they may not be interested in, especially if they don’t play slots).\
The advanced targeting can benefit both parties, but let’s be honest – it wouldn’t be applied if the outcomes weren’t financially backed.\
And as for the result – 5-15% boost in revenue for crypto casinos – not bad, right?\
It is a win-win scenario – casinos boost loyalty while players enjoy their sessions much more frequently.While AI can definitely contribute to better gameplay, it can also power an “active handbreak” – responsible gambling tools that can actively watch player behavior and spot problematic patterns. Systems can flag unusual activity, such as sudden betting increases from typically more “modest” punters.\
The latter can receive notifications when approaching deposit limits, which are helpful reminders about pre-set risk thresholds. The interventions balance enjoyment and protection, letting players maintain awareness without spoiling the fun.Blockchain already brings transparency to gambling. AI gets it even further.\
Machine learning models can predict game outcomes, betting frequencies, and login locations to spot cheating or collusion right away. Security systems flag logins from new devices or unusual IP addresses. The result? A safer gambling environment.\
The combination works in a full symbiosis – blockchain verifies every transaction while AI warrants system integrity. The “dynamic duo” makes players feel safer keeping funds on these platforms.Endless support queues can now be avoided, as AI chatbots now handle simple queries instantly and are available 24/7. For more complicated issues, bots transfer users to human representatives without requiring repetition.\
The efficiency enables midnight questions to receive immediate answers, improving player experience regardless of when they choose to play.AI powers front-end innovations beyond back-end analytics. VR-enabled casino games create immersive environments with virtual dealers and player avatars that feel surprisingly realistic.\
Some slot games feature AI-generated storylines or special quests, adding excitement to each spin. The technology merges with blockchain to deliver fresh experiences while maintaining verifiable fairness.AI Drives Business MetricsOf course, the implementation of AI in crypto casinos  benefit the operators. Here’s how.AI learns player habits and jumps in at just the right time. Like offering a blackjack bonus on Friday night if you're a weekend player. Or promoting a less popular slot when it sees you're into that style of game. It’s personalized, but not creepy.Casinos that treat players like individuals (rather than just another wallet), tend to keep them coming back. When the platform  your preferences, you’re more likely to stick around (and yes, deposit more).AI tools quietly monitor betting patterns, deposit sizes, and gameplay. It can flag the account for review if something looks off – like a sudden withdrawal spike from a normally cautious punter.AI  be the missing puzzle piece for blockchain gambling, which makes online casinos safer, more engaging, and better made for each player rather than satisfying the majority. The technology promotes a healthy balance between entertainment and responsible gambling through monitoring, personalization, and new concepts.\
AI will most probably continue to refine betting experiences through more precise risk assessments and immersive virtual environments. The casino industry just loves innovation, and AI proves to be an effective partner in that ongoing development process.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tariff uncertainty could singlehandedly drag down Canada&apos;s GDP, Rosenberg Says</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1HwP54-UvI</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W1HwP54-UvI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 17:00:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Economist and Bay Street veteran David Rosenberg says ongoing economy uncertainty could singlehandedly drag Canada's GDP to zero.

This is the reality ushered in by a new wave of artificial intelligence, already contributing to substantial additional revenues for companies. Monetization is undergoing a revolution thanks to AI. According to a McKinsey , while overall AI adoption remains steady at around 55%, only 23% of respondents reported that at least 5% of their organizations' EBIT last year was attributable to AI usage, indicating significant room for growth. This underscores a global challenge: how to harness AI's potential to balance revenue growth while maintaining a quality user experience.​\
Timofey Popov, an experienced product management specialist with proficiency in implementing technology-driven solutions across fintech and banking sectors, has dedicated the last eight years to perfecting digital monetization strategies. His career spans from creating financial products within major banking institutions to spearheading AI-powered product initiatives at organizations including SberMarket and McDonald's, where he has consistently revolutionized business revenue approaches. Additionally, he serves as a respected industry authority, participating as a jury member for the distinguished CX Awards and Globee Awards, where he assesses innovative developments in customer experience and digital transformation. This article will examine how his knowledge of adaptive algorithms, dynamic pricing systems, and personalization techniques has revolutionized these platforms, establishing new benchmarks for AI-enhanced monetization.When McDonald's decided to upgrade its mobile app, it turned to Popov, who had a unique vision for AI-driven monetization. What happened next would revolutionize how one of the world's largest fast-food chains approaches digital sales.\
"AI analyzed dozens of factors: time of day, order history, popular meal combinations, even the weather. Based on this data, each user was offered a personalized set of dishes and deals. For example, if someone often ordered coffee in the morning, the system could offer them a combo deal with a croissant," Popov explains.\
The results were staggering: the average check grew by 16%, repeat orders increased by 34%, and overall sales through the app skyrocketed by 480%. What started as a simple ordering tool became a cornerstone of McDonald's digital strategy, proving that AI-driven personalization could work globally.Building on his success at McDonald's, Popov went on to lead a team of 14 at the largest classifieds platform in the world. There, he focused on three key areas: promotional products for sellers, advertising inventory, and improving algorithms using Generative AI and transformer models.\
"The classifieds market is always a delicate balance between the interests of buyers and sellers. Using AI, we were able to personalize advertising offers and dynamically adjust bids. This increased revenues by 10% while simultaneously improving the user experience," Popov explains.\
The implementation of predictive models that analyze user behavior and predict optimal ad placements improved conversion rates by 17%, setting new standards for marketplace monetization. Popov also shared his insights on AI-driven advertising strategies at industry-leading conferences, including Epic Growth, where he presented on "ML in the Tasks of Expanding Advertising Inventory."Smart Pricing: Reinventing Retail at SberMarketAt SberMarket, one of the largest Russian marketplaces, Popov's team tackled a universal challenge in grocery retail — how to optimize sales with perishable inventory and volatile demand. Their solution? An AI-powered dynamic pricing system that would revolutionize how supermarkets approach inventory management.\
"Imagine a supermarket where prices automatically adjust to demand every hour. In the morning, milk might cost more because it's in high demand for breakfast, while in the evening, the price drops to ensure it sells before its expiration date. This is exactly the system we created using AI," Popov explains. The implementation of these "smart" prices brought the company a 19% increase in revenue.\
The system also learned to predict customer behavior. If AI noticed that a customer regularly ordered certain products, it would alert suppliers in advance to increase stock levels. This helped boost the number of loyal customers by 22% through proactive inventory management and personalized recommendations.The Future of AI-driven MonetizationPopov actively shares his expertise on professional platforms. His publications can be found in leading business outlets, including RBC and Cossa. He has previously spoken at the Epic Growth and Matemarketing conferences, presenting on implementing ML solutions in business processes.\
The transformation of monetization through AI is not just a trend but a new reality for businesses. Over eight years of working with product innovations, Popov has progressed from implementing basic algorithms to creating complex monetization systems based on artificial intelligence. His experience demonstrates that success in the digital era is determined not only by technological capabilities but also by the ability to balance business goals with user needs.\
"We are on the brink of a new era where autonomous monetization systems will become the foundation of the digital economy. In the future, we will see fully autonomous systems that will adapt to market changes independently, taking into account microeconomic fluctuations and user behavior," concludes Popov, highlighting how the smartphone in your pocket might soon become even smarter about understanding what you really want to buy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Attune - Build and publish APT repositories in seconds</title><link>https://github.com/attunehq/attune</link><author>ilikebits</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 16:14:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey HN, we're Eliza and Xin, and we’ve been working on Attune. Attune is a tool for publishing Linux packages.Previously, we worked at other startups building open source developer tools that ran on our customers’ CI and development machines. For many of them, being able to `apt-get install` our tools was a requirement.When we went to actually set up APT repositories, we were really surprised by the state of tooling around package publishing. The open source tools we found were old, slow, and difficult to figure out how to run in CI. The commercial tools we found were not much better. The cloud-hosted vendors required us to provide our signing keys to a cloud vendor (which was a non-starter), while the self-hosted vendors required us to operate our own specialized hosting servers.We just wanted something simple: sign locally, run quickly, be easy to use, and deploy to managed object storage.We couldn’t find it, so we built it. If you want to try it out, you can create a repository with three commands:    attune repo create --uri https://apt.releases.example.com
    attune repo pkg add --repo-id 123 package.deb
    attune repo sync --repo-id 123

You can get the tool at https://github.com/attunehq/attune. There are a lot of rough edges right now since it's so new - sorry in advance, we're working on sanding those down.It’s fully open source under Apache 2. We’re also working with some early customers to build enterprise features like audit logging, RBAC, and HSM integrations, and we’re thinking about building a managed cloud hosting service as well.We’d love your feedback on whether this is useful for you, and what you’d like to see next. We’re well aware that publishing is a small piece of CI/CD, but we think a lot of the tooling in this area (publishing, artifact registries, package repositories) could really use some love.What do you think?

The film accompanies these men of faith and combat, from their recruitment in Switzerland to their military training in the heart of the Vatican.

Made up of 150 men, this elite corps lives in barracks in the heart of Vatican City. All must be Swiss nationals and devout Catholics. All have sworn to fight to the death to protect their faith and the Holy Father.

They are heirs to a 500-year-old tradition in which the Pope’s protection and security were assured by mercenaries from Switzerland.

Trained to wield both halberds and semi-automatic assault rifles, the Swiss Guards form a unique army. But who are they really? What motivates these young boys to join this military and religious corps? An insight into a world usually closed to the cameras.

In the financial world, timing is everything. And in January 2025, Carl “Moon” Runefelt made a call that is now almost impossible to ignore. A familiar name in the crypto space, Runefelt :“Debts are rising alongside greed and euphoria in the stock market. The signs of a financial crisis are growing. I believe we will see a big financial meltdown… Bitcoin is the Noah’s Ark in the economic flood that is coming. Get in the boat.”\
At the time, markets were hot. Bitcoin had just pushed past the $100,000 mark, and stocks were continuing to climb. Optimism was everywhere, both in traditional finance and across crypto communities. Carl’s warning didn’t make headlines. It was written off as another bearish opinion during a time when nobody wanted to hear it.\
But fast forward to April, and that same tweet is back in circulation for a reason.\
Markets have taken a hit. Bitcoin has fallen to around $76,000. Ethereum is down too, and interest in DeFi and NFTs has cooled off. On the stock market side, the S&P 500 has dropped roughly 14 percent in just three trading days. That makes it one of the fastest and steepest short-term corrections since 1987. Suddenly, people are going back to Carl’s January post and wondering how he saw it coming.\
According to Carl, it came down to one thing: the federal funds effective rate. In a follow-up , he explained that his prediction wasn’t just a guess. He was looking at a pattern that has repeated itself over the last few decades. Each time the US begins cutting interest rates after a period of raising them, a recession tends to follow. The chart is simple. Rate cuts, then a gray recession bar. Again and again.\
Carl noticed that interest rates were peaking and starting to turn. To him, that signaled not just the possibility of a downturn, but the likely timing of one. Combined with high debt levels, soaring credit card usage, and the overheated mood in the markets, it all pointed to an incoming reset. That’s why in January, he said a major pullback was coming within months.\
And now, that timeline is starting to play out.\
On top of that, Carl doubled down with a  including a chart of the federal funds rate to back his claim. He wrote:“One of the main indicators I look at when I predict this coming stock market crash and recession is the federal funds rate. Over the past decades, when they start lowering the rate, a stock market crash and recession usually follow.”\
This chart, showing the relationship between falling rates and recessions, is central to Carl’s view that the current environment was unsustainable. But more importantly, Carl has a clear outlook on what happens next.\
He believes the Federal Reserve will eventually bring interest rates down to zero and begin printing massive amounts of money again. When that happens, he says Bitcoin will be the best way to protect wealth. He continues to describe Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, calling it “the Noah’s Ark” for those trying to escape the consequences of a broken financial system.\
Runefelt first rose to prominence through his YouTube channel . His story is well known in the crypto space. He went from working as a cashier in Sweden to building a global following, mostly by breaking down complex market movements in a way that’s easy to digest. He doesn’t just look at charts. He connects macro shifts with digital assets and speaks to the bigger picture.\
Even with prices falling, Carl hasn’t lost confidence in Bitcoin. In his latest commentary, he says he still believes Bitcoin could hit $300,000 by the end of the year. His more bullish outlook is $1 million per BTC, especially if the Fed turns the money printer back on. If quantitative easing returns in full force, Carl believes Bitcoin could soar to all-time highs once again.\
He also pointed out that short-term drops are part of the cycle. When markets panic, everything falls. But long-term investors, he says, should see this as an opportunity to buy. He even joked about selling his Bugatti to buy Ethereum, calling it “the trade of the century” if ETH rebounds to five figures.\
Carl’s big takeaway is that crypto and traditional markets are more linked than ever. When stocks fall, crypto usually follows. And that connection is exactly what he was watching when he made his prediction in January. The federal funds rate, market behavior, and liquidity trends all paint the same picture.\
Now, that prediction is no longer just a hot take. It’s a case study in spotting the signs before they show up in the headlines.\
Looking back, Carl’s message wasn’t exaggerated. It was right on time.\
And today, a lot more people are starting to pay attention.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deepak Chopra - Why Philosophy of Science?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egER5DfsneE</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/egER5DfsneE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 15:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow Closer To Truth on Instagram for new videos, announcements, and more: https://www.instagram.com/closertotruth/

Here’s why.

Every spring, millions of people are left coughing, sneezing, and itching their way out of winter. It’s a sign that nature is blooming back to life, dumping a ton of pollen into the air — and, subsequently, our respiratory tracts. Seasonal allergies are undeniably miserable, so it’s unsurprising that people are looking for miracle cures. One popular idea is to try and microdose pollen with honey.

The theory goes like this: Pollen causes seasonal allergies. Bees collect nectar and pollen from flowering plants to produce honey. So…a small amount of pollen is found in honey, therefore if you eat local honey you can introduce small amounts of pollen to your immune system and help your body gradually build an immunity to it. Boom. Seasonal allergies cured. The only problem? It doesn’t actually work, but honey does have a ton of other benefits. Watch the video above to learn more.

ABSTRACT
Responsible technology is having its time in the sun currently. Concerns about misinformation, bias, data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and accessibility issues, to name just a few of the concerns, seem to appear everywhere in the media. Who is the latest organization to be breached? Which airport is recovering from an "incident" - that wonderfully vague word?

Delivering technology in a responsible manner includes considering all the stakeholders to the solution, not just the obvious ones. The various flavors of architects operating across a solution (perhaps just a small number of people wearing different hats) must attempt to bring the perspectives of other stakeholders into the discussion surrounding features, targets, security requirements, and more. Making this work can be a challenge for teams.

In this talk, I will first discuss some principles of responsible technology and describe the various ways that making tech responsible generates value for organizations. I will then discuss how various aspects of responsible tech intersect with our good friends the -ilities. Finally, I will describe some techniques that can be used to support teams on their way to building responsible technology. [...]

DESCRIPTION
In a spirited discussion on collaborative modeling and decision-making, the the authors of “Collaborative Software Design: How to Facilitate Domain Modeling Decisions”—Evelyn vVan Kelle, Gien Verschatse, and Kenny Baas-Schwegler—explored the power of inclusive decision-making, shared understanding, and how to navigate social dynamics like bias, ranking and conflict in teams together with Xin Yao.

They highlighted the importance of facilitating not just through structured methods, but by empowering everyone in the team to contribute and lead decisions. Drawing from their experiences, they shared insights into the process of making better decisions through collaboration, the impact of "Deep Democracy", and the value of being able to step back and allow teams to thrive independently. Their conversation also touched on resources like Thinking, Fast and Slow, Jam Cultures, and Sitting in the Fire—tools to help teams make smarter decisions and grow together.

While the overall economy is not in recession, its people are.

The country’s GDP per capita fell for 21 consecutive months. Household disposable income is going down, while household debt is going up. The cost of living crisis will likely be front-and-center in federal elections.

At the port in Duisburg, Germany, shipping companies are taking departures out of their timetables, said Markus Bangen, who heads the company operating the world’s largest inland container harbor. They’re rattled by Trump’s tariffs, which have prompted manufacturers led by Volkswagen AG’s Audi to pause exports to the US.

“Within a few days, basic trust has been destroyed,” Bangen said in an interview. “Everyone who can stop deliveries to the US is doing so.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatLoopBackOff Episode 53 (​CubeFS)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72-vhF77_5M</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/72-vhF77_5M?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 05:07:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[​CubeFS, originally developed in 2017 by JD.com (one of China's largest e-commerce companies) is an open-source, cloud-native distributed storage system designed to handle unstructured data at scale.

When the user contacted Cursor support, an agent named "Sam" told them it was expected behavior under a new policy. But no such policy existed, and Sam was a bot. The AI model made the policy up, sparking a wave of complaints and cancellation threats documented on Hacker News and Reddit.This marks the latest instance of AI confabulations (also called "hallucinations") causing potential business damage. Confabulations are a type of "creative gap-filling" response where AI models invent plausible-sounding but false information. Instead of admitting uncertainty, AI models often prioritize creating plausible, confident responses, even when that means manufacturing information from scratch.For companies deploying these systems in customer-facing roles without human oversight, the consequences can be immediate and costly: frustrated customers, damaged trust, and, in Cursor's case, potentially canceled subscriptions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Basketball Coach Shares Coaching Philosophy -- and Really Hard Drills | Home Court Advantage</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVYR18c_LcE</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mVYR18c_LcE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 22:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Official website: https://to.pbs.org/IL_2024 | #IndieLensPBS

At one-one-thousandth of a second after the Big Bang, the great annihilation event should have wiped out all matter, leaving a universe of only radiation. Why still don't know why any matter survived. Well, a new finding from the LHC brings us one step closer to understanding why there's something rather than nothing.

Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still prioritizing speed and cost. Gemini 2.5 Flash is our first fully hybrid reasoning model, giving developers the ability to turn thinking on or off. The model also allows developers to set thinking budgets to find the right tradeoff between quality, cost, and latency. Even with  developers can maintain the fast speeds of 2.0 Flash, and improve performance.Our Gemini 2.5 models are thinking models, capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding. Instead of immediately generating an output, the model can perform a "thinking" process to better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response. On complex tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning (like solving math problems or analyzing research questions), the thinking process allows the model to arrive at more accurate and comprehensive answers. In fact, Gemini 2.5 Flash performs strongly on Hard Prompts in LMArena, second only to 2.5 Pro.Our most cost-efficient thinking model2.5 Flash continues to lead as the model with the best price-to-performance ratio.Fine-grained controls to manage thinkingWe know that different use cases have different tradeoffs in quality, cost, and latency. To give developers flexibility, we’ve enabled setting a  that offers fine-grained control over the maximum number of tokens a model can generate while thinking. A higher budget allows the model to reason further to improve quality. Importantly, though, the budget sets a cap on how much 2.5 Flash can think, but the model does not use the full budget if the prompt does not require it.The model is trained to know how long to think for a given prompt, and therefore automatically decides how much to think based on the perceived task complexity.If you want to keep the lowest cost and latency while still improving performance over 2.0 Flash, set the thinking budget to 0. You can also choose to set a specific token budget for the thinking phase using a parameter in the API or the slider in Google AI Studio and in Vertex AI. The budget can range from 0 to 24576 tokens for 2.5 Flash.The following prompts demonstrate how much reasoning may be used in the 2.5 Flash’s default mode.Prompts requiring low reasoning: “Thank you” in Spanish How many provinces does Canada have?Prompts requiring medium reasoning: You roll two dice. What’s the probability they add up to 7? My gym has pickup hours for basketball between 9-3pm on MWF and between 2-8pm on Tuesday and Saturday. If I work 9-6pm 5 days a week and want to play 5 hours of basketball on weekdays, create a schedule for me to make it all work.Prompts requiring high reasoning: A cantilever beam of length L=3m has a rectangular cross-section (width b=0.1m, height h=0.2m) and is made of steel (E=200 GPa). It is subjected to a uniformly distributed load w=5 kN/m along its entire length and a point load P=10 kN at its free end. Calculate the maximum bending stress (σ_max). Write a function evaluate_cells(cells: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, float] that computes the values of spreadsheet cells.Or a formula like  using , , , and other cells.Resolve dependencies between cells.Handle operator precedence ( before ).Detect cycles and raise ValueError("Cycle detected at <cell>").No . Use only built-in libraries.Start building with Gemini 2.5 Flash todayGemini 2.5 Flash with thinking capabilities is now available in preview via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio and in Vertex AI, and in a dedicated dropdown in the Gemini app. We encourage you to experiment with the  parameter and explore how controllable reasoning can help you solve more complex problems.We will continue to improve Gemini 2.5 Flash, with more coming soon, before we make it generally available for full production use.Model pricing is sourced from Artificial Analysis & Company Documentation]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rare Personal Items Recovered from Titanic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-PGO-dGSuA</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/x-PGO-dGSuA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 19:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join Dan Snow in this new film as he gets special access to a selection of incredible artefacts recovered from the Titanic including a pocket watch, a letter written aboard the ill-fated liner and the never before seen water-stained tickets discovered on the body of third class passenger, Ernest Tomlin.

From Chaos To Clarity: Scaling Observability at Dropbox With Centralized Logging Solution - Alok Ranjan, Dropbox Inc

At Dropbox, managing observability for systems producing terabytes of logs daily posed a unique challenge. Initially, developers accessed logs by logging into individual servers, a process further complicated when we moved to containers. Containers are short-lived, which caused logs to disappear on termination. This highlighted the need for a scalable, persisted, centralized solution using open-source tools.

In this session, I’ll discuss our journey to build a robust observability framework centered on Loki as our logging solution. Scaling Loki to Dropbox’s data volume required extensive optimizations for reliable, efficient query performance. I’ll cover our deployment, challenges, and strategies for achieving high-performance logging.

We also integrated Grafana to unify logs and metrics in a single view, enhancing troubleshooting and security. Join us to learn how Dropbox scaled its observability with open-source solutions and key lessons from our experience.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Observability Day | Closing Remarks - Anna Kapuścińska &amp; Austin Parker, Program Committee Co-Chairs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd-8rkLugFc</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rd-8rkLugFc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:54:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Manage Cloud Native LLM Workloads Across Edge and Cloud Seamlessly Using KubeEdge and WasmEdge - Vivian Hu, Second State & Fei Xu, Huawei Cloud

LLMs moving beyond data centers to edge devices. While this migration promises reduced latency and enhanced privacy, challenges come: maintaining accuracy within limited resources, and cross-device deployment problems.

The integration of KubeEdge and WasmEdge addresses the challenge. WasmeEdge is a lightweight, portable runtime (less than 50MB) without external dependencies. The KubeEdge Sedna orchestrates the edge-cloud collaboration. It monitors inference accuracy and automatically routes requests to cloud-based models when edge processing doesn't meet accuracy thresholds.

This session will demo that small LLMs provide quick, local inference at the edge. When higher accuracy is needed, Sedna seamlessly transitions to larger models in the cloud. The inference workload is built in Rust and compiled to Wasm, enabling deployment across edge and cloud without any changes.

The solution has been implemented in production across multiple industries like aerospace and bank branches.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2306 - Deric Poston</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqL-OQukxlY</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lqL-OQukxlY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:19:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deric Poston is a standup comic and host, along with Ehsan Ahmad, of "The Solid Show."

Borne out of desperation and bound to fail, the revolt becomes one of the key events of World War Two.

In 1940, hundreds of thousands of people, most of them Jewish, were crammed into a few square kilometers in the Polish capital Warsaw under the most terrible living conditions. The deportations to extermination camps began in 1942. A Jewish resistance organization was formed. SS troops marched into the ghetto in April 1943 and were met by hundreds of fighters who tried to push them back by force of arms.

The courage of these people has largely been forgotten. Many of those heroic Jewish fighters were women. The film hears the account of two of those women, Cywia Lubetkin and Rachel Auerbach, who survived the Holocaust and whose stories have never been heard. Through the interlinking of their narratives, the film sheds light on neglected, unknown aspects of the Warsaw revolt. Featuring photographic and video footage that’s never been seen before, the documentary explores the connections between individual lives and the march of history.

--

Plants assume a variety of forms, and trees are just one of them. What makes or breaks a tree can come down to some pretty specific characteristics, based on how the plant develops as a result of how it evolved. Trees don’t all comprise one closely related group, like insects or mammals. So, how exactly do trees get classified as trees? Max G. Levy explains what distinguishes these woody plants.

Many believe only their own religion to be the truth. Some claim all religions reflect the same truth. Others assert that differing dogmas expose the emptiness of all religion.

Most of the country’s biggest companies including Amazon and Google are incorporated in Delaware, but after a series of controversial court decisions, a wave of companies are looking at an exit. Business incorporation accounted for nearly 30% of revenue for DE in 2024, so what’s at stake for the state?

WSJ spoke with Gov. Matt Meyer and a corporate lawyer to explain how the state is fighting back – and why it matters.

In this post we argue that Americans should welcome the disappearance of TikTok because the company is causing harm to children, adolescents, and young adults at an industrial scale. Our evidence comes mostly from research done by those 14 Attorneys General. Some of their briefs have been posted online for the world to see. The briefs include hundreds of quotations from internal reports, memos, Slack conversations, and public statements in which executives and employees of TikTok acknowledge and discuss the harms that their company is causing to children. We organize the evidence into five clusters of harms:Addictive, compulsive, and problematic useDepression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, self-harm, and suicidePorn, violence, and drugsSextortion, CSAM, and sexual exploitationTikTok knows about underage use and takes little actioncompany insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms,“Compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety,”“interfer[ing] with essential personal responsibilities like sufficient sleep, work/school responsibilities, and connecting with loved ones.”Although these harms are known, the company often chooses not to act. For example, one TikTok employee explained,“[w]hen we make changes, we make sure core metrics aren’t affected.”“[l]eaders don’t buy into problems”  “not a priority for any other team.”“[f]amilies do not use Family Pairing” “Family Pairing doesn’t address parents’ top concerns,”“inappropriate content, offensive interactions, and lack of privacy. “Normalization of Pedophilia”“Minor Sexual Solicitation”“leading minors off platform”“Glorification of Minor Sexual Assault”improperly redactedtry it yourselfour versiona separate Google doc.2024 report from Pew Below you can see that TikTok is aiming to create just such compulsive use, which in turn can lead to problematic use disorders and behavioral addictions, which then compound the harms in the other four clusters. The company does this even though many of its employees believe their product is bad for children’s development.]TikTok’s executives and employees have admitted that they target young Americans, stating:“It’s better to have young people as an early adopter, especially the teenagers in the U.S. Why? They [sic] got a lot of time.Teenagers in the U.S. are a golden audience . . . . If you look at China, the teenage culture doesn’t exist — the teens are super busy in school studying for tests, so they don’t have the time and luxury to play social media appsKY P. 8, PARA 19 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]TikTok knows that the harmful effects of its Platform wreak havoc on the mental health of millions of American children and teenagers and harms them. Its executives have admitted:“The product in itself has baked into it compulsive use.The reason kids watch TikTok is because the algo[rithm] is really good. . . . But I think we need to be cognizant of what it might mean for other opportunities. And when I say other opportunities, I literally mean sleep, and eating, and moving around the room, and looking at somebody in the eyes.KY P. 20, PARA 64 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]arms race for attention[.][Below is a redacted graph from para 67 of KY brief. It shows that TikTok has reached saturation among the 29.7 million US users under the age of 17 who own a smartphone. This means that they can’t get more young users, but they can get more time out of each user, especially if they pull them away from competing platforms.]KY P. 40, PARA 121 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“As expected, across most engagement metrics, the younger the user the better the performance.”KY P.40, PARA 125 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT][internal TikTok group studying issues affecting TikTok]“Tiktok is particularly popular with younger users who are particularly sensitive to reinforcement in the form of social reward and have minimal ability to self-regulate effectively.”KY P. 55, PARA 181 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]Activate & Engage users with the right content at the right time, to encourage users to open the App more and stay longer.”activate users so they will return to the app.KY P. 67, PARA 223 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]TikTok’s success can largely be attributed to strong out of the box personalization and automation, which limits user agency“addiction and impulsive purchasing of virtual items,”“fully leaned in and immersed compared to other platforms.”  “the leading platform for Information Density” “algorithm and shorter video formats”  “create continuous cycles of engagement.”“can largely be attributed to strong . . . personalization and automation, which limits user agency” “product experience utiliz[ing] many coercive design tactics,”[i]nfinite scroll, auto-play, constant notifications,” “the ‘slot machine’ effect”“can be considered manipulative.”“particularly sensitive to reinforcement in the form of social award,”“minimal ability to self-regulate effectively,”“do not have executive function to control their screen time.” “TikTok is in most people’s lives like this,” “go on tiktok for 5 mins and 3 hours have passed” and “my night routine: watch 3 hours of tiktok videos, try to follow the dance steps, realise u suck at dancing n cry about it, continue watching tiktok videos, sleep.”TikTok is particularly popular with younger users, who are seen as more vulnerable to online harms and the negative impacts of compulsive use.” “negative emotions,” “interfered with [users’] obligations and productivity,” and led to “negative impacts . . . on their lives,”  “lost sleep, missed deadlines, poor school performance, running late, etc.” “many participants described their use of TikTok disturbing their sleep, which limited their productivity and performance the following day,”  “[e]very participant indicated that time management on TikTok was especially difficult compared to other social media platforms.”“feeling like they are trapped in a rabbit hole of what our algorithm thinks they like.”“Persuasive design strategies exploit the natural human desire to be social and popular, by taking advantage of an individual’s fear of not being social and popular in order to extend their online use. For young people, identity requires constant attention, curation and renewal. At key development stages it can be overwhelmingly important to be accepted by your peer group.”[These are the main harms we focused on in The Anxious Generation, although as you can see in the other four clusters, the harms caused by TikTok go far beyond mental health problems.]KY P. 60, PARA 196 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“offering effects that perpetuate a narrow beauty norm . .. ha[s] the potential to negatively impact the wellbeing of our community.”KY P. 65, PARA 213 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT][internal TikTok group studying issues affecting TikTok]“compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety.compulsive usage also interferes with essential personal responsibilities like sufficient sleep, work/school responsibilities, and connecting with loved ones.”KY P. 84, PARA 260 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]After following several ‘painhub’ and ‘sadnotes’ accounts, it took me 20 mins to drop into ‘negative’ filter bubble. The intensive density of negative content makes me lower down mood and increase my sadness feelings though I am in a high spirit in my recent life.”“there are a lot of videos mentioning suicide,”  “If you could kill yourself without hurting anybody would you?”KY P. 98, PARA 309-310 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]309. Defendants know these R1 reviews do not catch a great deal of content that violates the Community Guidelines or restrict content to age-appropriate groups.For example, a presentation about suicide and self-harm content moderation notes that R1 Moderators do not always speak the language shown in the videos, that moderators do not understand context, and that moderators are not given policy reminders for new instructions.[No direct quotes from TikTok employees, but see pages 36-43 for a section of the brief that describes the videos that were sent to fictitious accounts created by the AG’s office, pretending to be 13, 15, and 17 year old Nebraska residents. “Within minutes of scrolling through TikTok’s “For You” feed—before the accounts had searched for any videos or “followed” any users—TikTok’s algorithm repeatedly exposed each Nebraska teen account to overtly mature and otherwise inappropriate content.” Some of the videos sent to young girls—just on the basis of their age and gender—clearly encouraged young girls to starve themselves.]Some of the videos also clearly celebrate suicide as the way to escape from psychological pain.contentaccessedrecommendedusersKY P. 38, PARA 115 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]46.5% sexualized and drug content shared by WSJ is not covered by [the existing moderation] policy (ANSA 55%, Drug 24%).”“[t]he moderation leakage rate of sexualized and drug content is 73.5% (ANSA 58%, Drug 90%).”“most prevalent policy titles are sexually explicit language and mention of drugs,”implicit language [e.g., coded language] is often used in videos and failed to be captured [sic] by moderators.”KY P. 53, PARA 168 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“Minors Easily Access Livestream Feed”“[n]o age-related feed strategy.”“[o]ne of our key discoveries during this project that has turned into a major challenge with Live business is that the content that gets the highest engagement may not be the content we want on our platform. Transactional sexual content incorporates hundreds of signals that inform the [algorithm] as well as LiveOps metrics of success - # of gifts, frequency of hosts going live, # of comments, etc.”KY P.106, PARA 341 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“Normalization of Pedophilia”“Minor Sexual Solicitation”“leading minors off platform”“Glorification of Minor Sexual Assault”TikTok also knows that LIVE is being used for money laundering and other criminal activities.[TikTok has a virtual currency system where users can “gift” one another]. “sexually suggestive LIVE content is on the rise,”“make better use of monetization methods such as gifting and subscription to gain revenue . . . .”The Division’s presuit investigation also confirmed that TikTok’s platform facilitates the sale of illegal drugs to underage children right here at our doorstep—including easily allowing TikTok users to offer the sale and delivery of drugs like Xanax, Valium, and MDMA to children in Salt Lake City.“becoming more prevalent”“the majority didn’t violate guidelines” “the [TikTok] app doesn’t differentiate between videos it serves to adults and minors.”[See pages 35-36 and 43-50 for a section of the brief that describes the videos that were sent almost immediately to fictitious accounts created by the AG’s office, pretending to be 13, 15, and 17 year old Nebraska minors. Some of the videos are adult porn actresses engaging in lewd and obscene behavior on TikTok, in order to lure customers over to their Onlyfans pages, sometimes via Instagram.]“shouldn’t see mature or complex themes, such as: [p]rofanity[, s]exually suggestive content[, r]ealistic violence or threatening imagery[, f]irearms or weapons in an environment that isn’t appropriate[, i]llegal or controlled substances/drugs[, and e]xplicit references to mature or complex themes that may reflect personal experiences or real-world events that are intended for older audiences.” [But they do, as you can see in the leakage rates found in KY P. 106, PARA 341]Federal law mandates that Defendants report suspected CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (“NCMEC”) under 18 U.S.C. § 2258A. To limit and avoid its reporting requirements under federal law, Defendants purposely designed TikTok—which it knows are used by children, including children under 13—not to incorporate modern CSAM detection technology. This technology would be free for Defendants to implement within TikTok’s product design.PARA 113: While Defendants have stepped up their reporting to NCMEC [National Center for Missing & Exploited Children]—reporting 362,108 reports in the last half of 2023—these efforts illustrate how wantonly negligent TikTok has been historically, with only 596 reports made in 2019 and 22,692 in 2020. Defendants’ disregard for the safety of Young Users on TikTok has endangered countless children, including children in Kentucky.KY P. 100, PARA 316 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“[u]sers are more likely to post comments than videos,”“42% [of users] are ‘comment only’ users[.]”“Comments are increasing and manual coverage is disproportionately low.” “[h]uman moderation for comment review is at 0.25%.” “we’ve created an environment that encourages sexual content.”“enable[d the] exploitation of live hosts”In response to the Forbes article, TikTok also conducted a formal investigation into issues on LIVE called “Project Meramec.” TikTok shared the results of the investigation internally during a May 2022 “Safety Summit”:PARA 116: Project Meramec confirmed that young users well under the minimum age requirement could host LIVE sessions on TikTok. The study confirmed that in just the month of January 2022 alone, 112,000 “L1” users (i.e., a metric TikTok uses to categorize users between 13 and 15 years old) hosted LIVE sessions.“[H]igher proportion[s] of minor users”;“Minor users are more likely to access high severity risk LIVE content than adult users”;For violating content like “[a]dult nudity and sexual activities (ANSA) . . . and minor-hosted LIVE rooms, minor views are likely 2 times higher than other LIVE rooms”; “Minor users lack self-protection awareness and interact more with risky LIVE content.”In February 2022, two TikTok leaders discussed the need to remove “egregious content from clearly commercial sexual solicitation accounts,” and were aware of issues with women and minors being sexually solicited through LIVE.PARA 112: these leaders knew about agencies that recruited minors to create Child Sexual Abuse Material and commercialized it using LIVE.“streamer-led sexual engagements (often transactional) [were] commonly associated with TikTok LIVE.”“often seeing cam-girls or prostitutes asking viewers for tips/donations to take off their clothes or write their names on their body . . . .”“good amount of minors engaging in it.”  “a lot of nudity and soft porn.”  “perpetrators tend to use tactics such as gift giving, flattery, and gifting money to win the trust of minors.”In September 2022—five months after the Forbes story—an investigator found that “within minutes of browsing the [LIVE] feed” they were shown underage girls providing sexually suggestive content in exchange for money and young boys using filters to pose as girls to receive Gifts.PARA 126: The investigator also found a “never-ending stream” of hosts who openly admitted that they were 14 and 15 years old while also “holding signs” or “standing in front of the camera” with a sign saying “Rose = say daddy,” “ice cream = 360 spin,” or “universe = cut shirt.”TikTok LIVEregularlyKY P. 93, PARA 288 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“goal is not to reduce the time spent”“contribute to DAU [daily active users] and retention” KY P. 93, PARA 289 [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“we don’t expect significant impact to stay time with this feature since it is only improving awareness and is not an intervention.”“minors do not have executive function to control their screen time.”KY P. 95, PARA 297, [REDACTED BUT RETRIEVABLE TEXT]“provide users with educational resources about image disorders; create a campaign “to raise awareness on issues with low self esteem (caused by the excessive filter use and other issues)”; and add “a banner/H5 page to these filters and/or short videos which make use of the filters, particularly the Bold Glamour one, including an awareness statement about filters and the importance of positive body image/mental health, [that] could potentially minimize the negative public perception surrounding beauty filters and their reported effect on user mental health.”PARA 123: But raising the minimum age from 16 to 18 did nothing to solve the problem. TikTok’s age-gating is ineffective, and many kids still join LIVE events daily. TikTok also chose to forgo reasonable safety measures, prioritizing profits over safety, allowing unrestrained transactional sexual content and other illicit activities to thrive.‘teens in overtly sexualized situations on live streams controlled by someone older than 18 who is collecting money from viewers while the teen performs sexually suggestive acts.’ “Minors are more curious and prone to ignore warnings”“Without meaningful age verification methods, minors would typically just lie about their age.”“such a huge part of the strategy for the [TikTok app]” “reasonably expect to increase limitations for LIVE”  “it is irresponsible [of TikTok] to expect that users will use LIVE wisely.”PARA 120: In other words, LIVE was too profitable to be interfered with, even to protect children.These policies do not adequately safeguard children and, furthermore, are not consistently applied. In 2020, TikTok unveiled an ‘internal program’ to ‘protect creators and other accounts that [TikTok] deem to be high value.’ The program featured policy shortcuts like ‘delayed enforcement,’ ‘deferred policy decisions,’ or ‘no permanent ban on Elite + Accounts,’ to protect its popular users who violate TikTok’s policies. TikTok deployed this look-the-other-way policy despite knowing that the ‘majority of elite accounts appear to run afoul of [TikTok’s] policies on sexually explicit content,’ among other violations. Approximately 1,400 minors were considered ‘elite creators.’“a lot of the users, especially top users, are under 13,” “those kids will anyway say they are over 13.”“[f]amilies do not use Family Pairing” “Family Pairing doesn’t address parents’ top concerns,”“inappropriate content, offensive interactions, and lack of privacy.“we don’t want to [make changes] to the For You feed because it’s going to decrease engagement,” “it could actually help people with screen time management.”“[w]hen we make changes, we make sure core metrics aren’t affected.”“[l]eaders don’t buy into problems”  “not a priority for any other team.”“[w]e found out through some research that they’re not altogether effective” “it’s good as a point to share with policymakers, ‘cause they’re kind of impressed that we’re spending time, money, and energy to get people off our platform, at least in theory.”“not . . . at expense of retention.”not to reduce the time spent” “improve user experience and satisfaction”contribute to DAU [Daily Active Users] and retention.” “[t]his aligns with leadership’s guidance” “no impact to retention.”I’ve tried to quit but I just can’t do it,I can’t quit because then I won’t know what everyone else is talking abouttrappedKori James saidrecent studymost students were willing to pay to have that happenconducted a nationally representative surveyWhat, then, is the net value of TikTok to society? The harms are vast and varied, and they are hitting children, teens, and young adults the hardest, which means that TikTok may be altering developmental pathways and causing lasting changes. The net value is likely very negative. We believe that America would be much better off if TikTok were to go dark on January 19th.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Guiding an LLM for Robust Java ByteBuffer Code</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/14-guiding-llm-java-bytebuffer.html</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Dev - Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AI editors like Cursor can generate code with remarkable speed using

DESCRIPTION
Peter Kröner and Stefan Baumgartner explore practical TypeScript implementation strategies in this discussion of Stefan's latest book, "TypeScript Cookbook", a sequel to his previous work "TypeScript in 50 Lessons". From minimal type annotations to knowing when to use advanced features, Stefan shares insights on efficient project setup, alternatives to enums, and the strategic use of classes.

The conversation examines the philosophy behind TypeScript's design while emphasizing a pragmatic approach that focuses on understanding what happens behind the scenes to make better coding decisions. Stefan consistently advocates for simplicity and intentionality when working with TypeScript's powerful but sometimes complex type system.

But at scale, this becomes a surprisingly complex distributed systems problem.Imagine millions of users liking posts simultaneously, especially during . The system must remain , , and , even under heavy load.How do we handle  that receive massive, sudden traffic?How do we maintain  in likes count across distributed nodes?How do we ensure  and  as the number of like events scales into the millions?How do we make sure each user’s like is counted ?In this article, we’ll walk through how to design a scalable like-counting system starting from a basic design and gradually evolving it into a robust, distributed architecture.Along the way, we’ll explore important system design concepts and trade-offs, including:Strong vs. Eventual ConsistencyDeduplication (Idempotency)We’ll also discuss how to support , and how to build features like  using the like stream for real-time analytics.Before we jump into the design, let’s define what our “likes” system needs to support, both functionally and non-functionally.1. Functional RequirementsUsers can  and  a post by toggling the like button.A user can like a post . If they press “like” again, it should be treated as an .Both the post owner and viewers should be able to see the  for a post.The like count should update  after a like/unlike action.Show a full list of all users who liked a post.2. Non-Functional Requirements The system should handle thousands of likes per second, including spikes from viral content (say a celebrity’s post).The system must be horizontally scalable (able to add servers/nodes to handle growth): A failure in one component should not bring down the whole “likes” functionality. Liking a post should feel . The displayed count can lag slightly but should stay reasonably up to date. We aim for  — brief discrepancies in counts are acceptable, but they must reconcile quickly.  is nice-to-have, not a must. No likes should be lost, even during failures. Every like must be recorded persistently. A user’s like should count only once, even if the action is retried or duplicated. The system should support analytics use cases like identifying  (e.g., most-liked posts in the last hour).With these in mind, let’s begin with a simple solution and then evolve it into a scalable architecture by addressing each limitation.1. Basic Single-Database DesignLet’s start with the most straightforward solution — storing likes in a single relational database.We create a  table with columns like:(optional)  (auto-incremented)Every time a user likes a post, we insert a new row into this table.To get the total likes for a post, we simply run:SELECT COUNT(1) FROM Likes WHERE post_id = X;Alternatively, we could maintain a  field in a  table and increment it on every like.But for simplicity, let’s stick to querying the  table directly.On unlike, we can simply delete the corresponding row from the  table.DELETE FROM Likes WHERE post_id = 123 AND user_id = 'user_456';This approach also allows us to easily retrieve the list of users who liked a specific post using a simple query:SELECT user_id FROM Likes WHERE post_id = X;To optimize read queries, we can add an on, which improves lookup performance as the table grows.This setup is a typical monolith or simple web stack: Handles "like" requests from users. Stores each like action in the  tableWhen a user likes a post, the likes service inserts a record into the database. When someone views a post, it queries the total likes from the same database.Simplicity and Strong Consistency: Once the DB insert is successful, any subsequent reads will reflect the updated count. Everyone, the liker and other users sees the updated value immediately.Enforces Uniqueness Easily: We can add a  constraint to ensure that each user can only like a post once. If a user tries to like the same post again, the DB will reject it.Checking whether a user liked a post is a fast lookup on .SELECT 1 FROM Likes WHERE post_id = X AND user_id = Y;Every like triggers a write. With millions of users, the DB quickly becomes a bottleneck. A single SQL database can’t handle that level of write throughput.Using  on large tables is slow. As posts gain millions of likes, counting them becomes a performance problem — even with indexing.Each like inserts a row. Each post view might run a  query. Under load, these operations can slow down the system significantly.If the database goes down, users can’t like posts or see updated counts.Limited Horizontal Scaling: You can add read replicas to spread reads, but writes still go to the primary database. Scaling vertically (more CPU/RAM) only goes so far.This design is , offering  and . But it falls apart at scale.To handle real-world traffic with millions of users and viral posts, we need to evolve this architecture to improve performance, scalability, and availability.2. Improving Read Efficiency – Caching and Aggregated CountsIn our basic design, reading the like count with  is expensive and hits the database hard — especially for popular posts. To fix this, we introduce two improvements:Maintain precomputed like countsUse caching for fast readsInstead of computing the count on every read, we store it alongside the post. This can be done by:Adding a  column in the  table, orCreating a separate  table with schema: Each time a user likes or unlikes a post, we  this count. This turns a costly  query into a fast primary-key lookup.We add an in-memory cache (e.g.,  or ) to store frequently accessed like counts:The app checks the cache first.If the data isn’t in the cache (cache miss), it queries the DB, then stores the result in cache.Subsequent reads for the same post hit the cache, not the DB.(a distributed in-memory cache cluster) Stores  pairs in memory for fast access. Stores aggregated like counts in either the  table or a dedicated table.Insert a row into the  table.Increment the  in the  or  table.UPDATE Posts SET like_count = like_count + 1 WHERE post_id = XIf both the like insertion and count update are in the same DB, we can wrap them in a  for strong consistency.BEGIN;

-- 1. Insert into Likes table
INSERT INTO Likes (post_id, user_id, timestamp)
VALUES (123, 'user_456', NOW());

-- 2. Increment like count
UPDATE Posts
SET like_count = like_count + 1
WHERE post_id = 123;

COMMIT;Invalidate or update the cache entry for that post’s count.We still need the  table to log all the like events and find users who liked a post.On cache miss, query for  from  table, then populate the cache.SELECT like_count FROM WHERE post_id = X Fetching the like count is now  — either from cache or via a quick primary-key lookup. No more expensive aggregations over many rows. Cache absorbs most read traffic, especially for viral posts that are viewed repeatedly.Strong Consistency (for a single server): A transactional write ensures that the  row and the  update stay in sync. We’re caching a single number (the count), which is easy to update or invalidate on write. When the like count changes in the DB, the cache needs to be updated or invalidated. Otherwise, clients may be shown stale data. A common pattern is: 1. Update DB
2. Invalidate cacheWrite Contention on Hot Posts: Now every like involves two writes (insert in the  table + update in the  table). For popular posts, the  row can become a hotspot, causing lock contention in the DB. (We will address this later with sharding and other techniques.): All likes still go through the same DB instance. While reads are faster, we haven’t solved write scalability yet.Eventual Consistency in Caches: If using read replicas or multiple cache layers, some clients may see slightly stale counts due to replication lag or delayed cache updates. Usually acceptable within a short window (milliseconds to seconds). Storing every post’s count in cache uses memory. Fortunately, the data size is small, and infrequently accessed entries (e.g. old posts) can be evicted.Despite the drawbacks, this step significantly improves read performance. Instead of recalculating likes for every view, we cache or store the count and serve it instantly.But the write path is still centralized, and hot posts can create contention. To scale further, we need to distribute the write workload — which we’ll explore next.3.

I’m Dane, the creator of Plandex (https://github.com/plandex-ai/plandex), an open source AI coding agent focused especially on tackling large tasks in real world software projects.Now I’m launching a major update, Plandex v2, which is the result of 8 months of heads down work, and is in effect a whole new project/product.In short, Plandex is now a top-tier coding agent with fully autonomous capabilities. It combines models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google to achieve better results, more reliable agent behavior, better cost efficiency, and better performance than is possible by using only a single provider’s models.I believe it is now one of the best tools available for working on large tasks in real world codebases with AI. It has an effective context window of 2M tokens, and can index projects of 20M tokens and beyond using tree-sitter project maps (30+ languages are supported). It can effectively find relevant context in massive million-line projects like SQLite, Redis, and Git.A bit more on some of Plandex’s key features:- Plandex has a built-in diff review sandbox that helps you get the benefits of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project. By default, all changes accumulate in the sandbox until you approve them. The sandbox is version-controlled. You can rewind it to any previous point, and you can also create branches to try out alternative approaches.- It offers a ‘full auto mode’ that can complete large tasks autonomously end-to-end, including high level planning, context loading, detailed planning, implementation, command execution (for dependencies, builds, tests, etc.), and debugging.- The autonomy level is highly configurable. You can move up and down the ladder of autonomy depending on the task, your comfort level, and how you weigh cost optimization vs. effort and results.- Models and model settings are also very configurable. There are built-in models and model packs for different use cases. You can also add custom models and model packs, and customize model settings like temperature or top-p. All model changes are version controlled, so you can use branches to try out the same task with different models. The newly released OpenAI models and the paid Gemini 2.5 Pro model will be integrated in the default model pack soon.- It can be easily self-hosted, including a ‘local mode’ for a very fast local single-user setup with Docker.- Cloud hosting is also available for added convenience with a couple of subscription tiers: an ‘Integrated Models’ mode that requires no other accounts or API keys and allows you to manage billing/budgeting/spending alerts and track usage centrally, and a ‘BYO API Key’ mode that allows you to use your own OpenAI/OpenRouter accounts.And of course I’d love to hear your feedback, whether positive or negative. Thanks so much!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Healthy soil is the hidden ingredient</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01026-x</link><author>gnabgib</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 21:13:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to the land, the European Union faces a reckoning: 60–70% of its soils are considered unhealthy, resulting in soil degradation. That costs €50 billion (US$55 billion) annually because of the loss of essential services and the effect on human health. Spain has the highest rates of soil degradation in Europe, with an average of 14.2 tonnes of soil lost per hectare to erosion each year. Although its importance is often overlooked, quality soil is essential for sustaining agriculture and crucial ecosystems. Its importance was highlighted in the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with soil health named as a key factor in achieving several of the goals.Having studied soil erosion in vineyards across Europe, Jesús Rodrigo Comino, a geographer at the University of Granada, Spain, is hoping to unearth a solution. Now he works with farmers, researchers and policymakers to test and use more-sustainable soil-management practices in vineyards and more broadly. Rodrigo Comino speaks to  about his research programme and why healthy soils are important for Spain’s cultural heritage and economy.Tell us about your work in soil science.I was always a curious kid, but my passion for soil science began with my studies at the University of Malaga in Spain and at Trier University in Germany. My home region of Andalusia in Spain has some really beautiful landscapes, but some areas are heavily degraded because of soil erosion and other factors. I felt compelled to find solutions to these problems. When I came back to Spain in 2021 after doing my PhD and a postdoctoral position in Germany, I started a project to assess soil erosion and degradation in vineyards using geographical mapping systems and artificial intelligence (AI). Soil erosion is caused by natural factors, such as extreme rainfall events and strong winds, as well as by human-driven activities, including tillage and urbanization. AI helps me to design and polish the software codes that I use to create geographical maps and analyse data. The main idea is to develop tools to help farmers make decisions. These might be about how to apply irrigation systems; which types of cover crop to plant; or when to till the soil, if necessary, to prevent soil degradation.I’m also involved in a Soil Living Labs project called SOILCRATES, which is part of an EU mission called A Soil Deal for Europe. The goal is to create field sites where soil scientists, agronomists, stakeholders and policymakers come together to conduct experiments and establish plots with sustainable soils. As part of the project, we also aim to show people how important fertile soils are to their lives and how their actions can affect soil health. The EU is now investing in a variety of projects to improve soil quality and enhance people’s understanding of soil. I’ve seen people implementing good practices to reduce soil erosion. But we’re not there yet — much more work is needed. How has climate change affected your work?It is evident that many places, especially urban ones, are experiencing an increase in temperature and a reduction in precipitation volume. We’re also seeing a concentration of extreme rainfall events in short periods of time, such as the flooding that happened in Valencia in Spain last year. All of these factors can affect soil health.When it comes to the vineyards in Spain, we don’t yet have enough data to confirm whether and how climate change is altering them — but the trends are clear. We know that vineyards are encountering higher temperatures now than they did in the past, and that this is causing the vines to flower earlier. Annual rainfall is being concentrated into shorter time periods, and we’re also experiencing extreme rainfall events, which cause soil erosion.What are farmers telling you about their experiences?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI Debuts Codex CLI, an Open Source Coding Tool For Terminals</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/04/16/1931240/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI has released Codex CLI, an open-source coding agent that runs locally in users' terminal software. Announced alongside the company's new o3 and o4-mini models, Codex CLI directly connects OpenAI's AI systems with local code and computing tasks, enabling them to write and manipulate code on users' machines. 

The lightweight tool allows developers to leverage multimodal reasoning capabilities by passing screenshots or sketches to the model while providing access to local code repositories. Unlike more ambitious future plans for an "agentic software engineer" that could potentially build entire applications from descriptions, Codex CLI focuses specifically on integrating AI models with command-line interfaces. 

To accelerate adoption, OpenAI is distributing $1 million in API credits through a grant program, offering $25,000 blocks to selected projects. While the tool expands AI's role in programming workflows, it comes with inherent risks -- studies show AI coding models frequently fail to fix security vulnerabilities and sometimes introduce new bugs, particularly concerning when given system-level access.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Making DNSimple (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/637</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/637/the-changelog-637.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anthony Eden, Founder & CEO of DNSimple, joins the show to talk about the world of managed hosting for DNS and more.Changelog++ members save 9 minutes on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

Assume that free will is real, not an illusion, and that the only reality is physical. How then could the will possibly be free? By what mechanism could human choice transcend the strong determinism of a closed physical world? One can try diminishing one side or the other: reducing free will or softening determinism, but each has its own difficulties.

Viewer discretion is strongly advised.

As Allied forces pushed deeper into Nazi-held territory in the spring of 1945, they would uncover scenes that defied imagination. Among these was a place whose name would become synonymous with unspeakable suffering and cruelty the world over, revealing the depths of human depravity and the monumental scale of horror wrought by the Nazi regime; Bergen-Belsen.

Without the extensive photo and video evidence taken following the camps liberation, no one could have conceived of the horrors that happened within the walls of Bergen-Belsen. Images of intense human suffering would shake the world to its core, and to this day remain some of the starkest reminders, of the one of the darkest chapters in human history.

They made this commitment more than 20 years ago. But even today, more than a million minors are still working on cocoa plantations. How is this possible?

In 2002, the chocolate industry made a contractual commitment to ban child labor on cocoa plantations within five years. We want to know: are companies honoring this commitment? Many chocolate manufacturers stand for fair trade and sustainability -- and against child labor. But as the film shows, often the fancy labels on chocolate packaging are just empty promises.

In Ivory Coast, for example, children still toil on cocoa plantations - with the simplest of tools, and without protective clothing, although they handle pesticides - for many hours every day. Often, they’re not the farmers’ children, but ‘slave children’ sent as laborers by desperate families in Mali or Burkina Faso because they’re no longer able to feed them.

But there are some small rays of hope: In the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic promotes fair organic farming. There is barely any child labor in this island nation and cocoa farmers can expect a fair income. Although the Caribbean produces just two per cent of global cocoa, it’s an example of what can be done.

The film also shows that sometimes, companies are unaware of conditions on the plantations, as practices are concealed by the middlemen. And that in some countries, little has changed since the signing of the protocol to end child labor in the cocoa industry.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION examines how America’s founding turned the world upside-down. Thirteen British colonies on the Atlantic Coast rose in rebellion, won their independence, and established a new form of government that radically reshaped the continent and inspired centuries of democratic movements around the globe.

An expansive look at the virtues and contradictions of the war and the birth of the United States of America, the film follows dozens of figures from a wide variety of backgrounds. Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war. 

The Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Costco’s Co-Founder Said ‘No’ to Kirkland Gas 8 Times | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RrIgCy6y4g</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9RrIgCy6y4g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Costco’s co-founder Jim Sinegal sat down with The Wall Street Journal, discussing how he built the $86 billion Kirkland Signature private label, why he was so reluctant to get into the gasoline business and what made him leave FedMart and The Price Club after nearly three decades.

There’s a town in Florida where the sun seems to always shine. Where the clouds almost always blow past before they turn to rain. A city with the Guinness World Record for consecutive sunny days, where the local newspaper was willing to bet against the weather by giving a free paper out whenever the sun didn’t shine. And spoiler alert: they didn’t give out that many.

That city is St. Petersburg, Florida — and for the most part, it actually lives up to its reputation. In the average year it gets 361 days of sunshine, which sounds impossible in the wet and rainy state of Florida. But St. Pete exists in what we call a meteorological goldilocks zone. So what exactly is it that makes this Florida city so damn sunny? Check out Vox Video's latest to find out.

ABSTRACT
When programming these days it’s easy to forget the many layers of abstractions between what you type and what the computer you run your code on is actually doing.
In this talk, Matt will describe some of the performance features of modern CPUs and explain how your code is already benefiting from them. We’ll look at real-world server performance, the tooling available to measure their impact, and how compilers are often already doing the right thing for us.

By the end of the talk you’ll appreciate the amazing work of chip designers and compiler authors, but you’ll also know how to diagnose when things go awry, and what to do about it. [...]

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, 2 university students decided to build a meme generator.Yet their business idea failed.So they pivoted to create a design tool for the browser and called it Figma.They stored metadata such as file information and user comments in a  database for simplicity.Yet their traffic was massive.And it affected latency and performance because of high CPU usage.So they  by installing Postgres on a larger machine. It means more CPU.Although it temporarily solved their scalability issue, there were new problems.Some tables grew extremely fast.While smallest unit of partition is a table.So a single database couldn’t handle their storage needs.They received a ton of write operations.It exceeded the input-output per second () limit of a single database. So the performance became poor.Ship and scale production grade apps at a blistering pace with GibsonAI, your AI-powered serverless database. With GibsonAI, you will:Design your database with natural language and view it as a diagram (ERD) & code.Deploy both dev and production environments in seconds with one click.Access your database directly or through the secure REST API built for you.Instruct GibsonAI to build, query, or update databases right from your favorite IDE via the GibsonAI MCP server.Migrations, optimization and scaling handled for you.Here’s how they scaled Postgres step by step:They set up database replicas and  towards it.Reduce latency by keeping data closer to users around the worldIncrease fault tolerance as replicas could take over when the leader database failsYet replicas couldn’t handle some read operations because of replication lag and strong consistency needs. So they route those operations to the leader database.Besides they added a caching layer to store frequently accessed data, thus reducing the database load.They moved tables into separate databases based on the domain.Scale horizontally by adding more databasesSpread workload across databases and reduce bottlenecksFor example, they store file information and user comments in separate databases because file information grows faster than comments. While the workload is different for each table.Ready for the next technique?They set up PgBouncer as the connection pooler.It acts as a TCP proxy holding a pool of connections to Postgres.And the client connects directly to PgBouncer instead of Postgres.Allow clients to reuse the same connection and improve throughputLimit the number of database connections to avoid connection starvationKeep persistent connections with the client to avoid expensive reconnection requestsThey moved columns from high-traffic tables into separate tables. And then stored those tables in different databases.Yet each table has its own database. Put simply, a single table doesn’t spread across many databases.Isolate sensitive data for securityReduce workload by routing traffic across many databasesAchieve high query performance by scanning only a subset of dataYet vertical partitioning becomes a bottleneck with high write traffic. Because a single database wouldn’t be able to store a table with billions of rows.5. Horizontal PartitioningThey split tables at the row level and stored them across many databases for maximum scalability.Also they set up a  to route queries to the correct database.Rewrite expensive queries for performanceManage database topology and support transactionsDrop extra requests when it exceed the threshold limitThey used the hash of the partition key to route write requests. Thus distributing data uniformly across databases.Besides they co-located tables partitioned by the same key to make transactions and joins easier.Figma became a popular design tool with over 40 million users.This case study shows Postgres can easily handle internet-scale traffic.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’ll launch system design deep dives in this newsletterYet it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of the newsletterMy mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

Sheryl Lee Ralph's third great grandparents, a mixed race couple, got married in 1837. Her third great grandfather Hugh, a white man, left his estate to Mary, a mixed race woman. This circumstance would have been a rarity for 1800s Jamaica.

In 2022, Sheryl Lee Ralph won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of “Barbara Howard,” Abbott’s veteran Kindergarten teacher, on ABC’s hit comedy series “Abbott Elementary.” She was nominated again for the second and third seasons of the series. On stage, she is well known for her award-winning work and creating the role of “Deena Jones” in the legendary Broadway musical “Dreamgirls,” which earned her Best Actress nods for Tony and Drama Desk Awards. Ralph made her feature film debut at 20 years-old opposite Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier in Warner Bros. A Piece of the Action, which Poitier also directed. Other notable roles include Mistress with Robert de Niro, To Sleep with Anger with Danny Glover, and The Distinguished Gentlemen with Eddie Murphy, Sister Act 2 with Whoopi Goldberg, “Moesha,” and “Ray Donovan.”

These assemblers tend to be poorly documented, provide languages that are clunky and verbose, be bloated and difficult to operate, and work only on one operating system. Development of C compilers is often a higher priority than the development of good assemblers.Instead of learning a new assembler for every embedded processor, it would be preferrable to instead use a single general-purpose assembler for every project. Torque was created to fill this niche.Torque is designed around the idea that any assembly language can be emulated with just integers, bit sequences, labels, and sufficiently powerful macros. With Torque, the instruction encoding for a target processor can be defined as a set of macros in the program itself, using templates to specify how values are packed into ranges of bits. A program can be written for any processor using only Torque and the datasheet for that processor.The latest release is available at tq-2.3.0 as a pre-compiled Linux executable.To build the Torque assembler from source, first install the Rust compiler from www.rust-lang.org/tools/install, then install the nightly toolchain with rustup toolchain install nightly, and then run cargo +nightly build --release inside the  source code directory.The compiled binary will be created at .The following command will assemble the Torque source file  and save the assembled output to the file  in the chosen format.tq [source] [destination] --format=<format>

The letter tells Lovable to stop using the term "Dev Mode" for a new product feature. Figma, which also has a feature called Dev Mode, successfully trademarked that term last year, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. What's wild is that "dev mode" is a common term used in many products that cater to software programmers. It's like an edit mode. Software products from giant companies like Apple's iOS, Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Xbox have features formally called "developer mode" that then get nicknamed "dev mode" in reference materials.
 
Even "dev mode" itself is commonly used. For instance Atlassian used it in products that pre-date Figma's copyright by years. And it's a common feature name in countless open source software projects. Figma tells TechCrunch that its trademark refers only to the shortcut "Dev Mode" -- not the full term "developer mode." Still, it's a bit like trademarking the term "bug" to refer to "debugging." Since Figma wants to own the term, it has little choice but send cease-and-desist letters. (The letter, as many on X pointed out, was very polite, too.) If Figma doesn't defend the term, it could be absorbed as a generic term and the trademarked becomes unenforceable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You Should Still Learn To Code, Says GitHub CEO</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/04/15/1853254/you-should-still-learn-to-code-says-github-ceo?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 18:53:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You should still learn to code, says GitHub's CEO. And you should start as soon as possible. From a report: "I strongly believe that every kid, every child, should learn coding," Thomas Dohmke said in a recent podcast interview with EO. "We should actually teach them coding in school, in the same way that we teach them physics and geography and literacy and math and what-not." Coding, he added, is one such fundamental skill -- and the only reason it's not part of the curriculum is because it took "us too long to actually realize that." 

Dohmke, who's been a programmer since the 90s, said he's never seen "anything more exciting" than the current moment in engineering -- the advent of AI, he believes, has made the field that much easier to break into, and is poised to make software more ubiquitous than ever. "It's so much easier to get into software development. You can just write a prompt into Copilot or ChatGPT or similar tools, and it will likely write you a basic webpage, or a small application, a game in Python," Dohmke said. "And so, AI makes software development so much more accessible for anyone who wants to learn coding." 

AI, Dohmke said, helps to "realize the dream" of bringing an idea to life, meaning that fewer projects will end up dead in the water, and smaller teams of developers will be enabled to tackle larger-scale projects. Dohmke said he believes it makes the overall process of creation more efficient. "You see some of the early signs of that, where very small startups -- sometimes five developers and some of them actually only one developer -- believe they can become million, if not billion dollar businesses by leveraging all the AI agents that are available to them," he added.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>4chan has been down since Monday night after “pretty comprehensive own”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/internet-cesspit-4chan-apparently-hacked-mostly-unreachable-since-monday-night/</link><author>Andrew Cunningham</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4chan-logo-1152x648.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 18:43:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Infamous Internet imageboard and wretched hive of scum and villainy 4chan was apparently hacked at some point Monday evening and remains mostly unreachable as of this writing.

Residents of these underserved neighborhoods are forced to live with violence and a lack of opportunities. But not everyone is willing to accept the situation.

In the areas known as the "Quartiers Nord" or "Northern Quarters" of Marseille, drug trafficking and gang wars are a part of everyday life. Drug-related violence has claimed dozens of lives in recent years and the French government has been unable to improve the situation, leaving residents in a hopeless situation. But Amine Kessaci wants to change that. The 21-year-old is the founder of an organization called Conscience. The group campaigns locally and citywide for better living conditions in these neighborhoods. It also supports families who have lost loved-ones to drug-related gang violence — something Amine has experienced himself.
Another ray of hope for these troubled districts is a converted firefighting bus that provides medical assistance. Doctor Slim Hadiji and his team offer preventive care and hold information events. They also make house calls and accompany patients to medical appointments. The initiative supports those who would otherwise receive little to no help.
Meanwhile, local football club FCL Malpassé is an important community hub and a safe haven for the children and young people living in these areas. The club's coaches are available around the clock. They hope their club can offer young people not just a safe place to go, but also a chance to improve their lives.

Consistently with on-line perceptual signal analysis, the EWMA gives more weight to recent input values, whereas the contributions of older values decay exponentially.
A compact, iterative formulation of the model affords computing an update at each signal input sample, requiring no buffering and involving only a handful of arithmetic operations.Each resonator, characterized by its resonant frequency \(f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}\), is described by a complex number \(R\) whose amplitude captures the contribution of the input signal component around frequency \(f\).
The formulas below capture the recursive update for \(R\) by way of a phasor \(P\), applied for each sample \(x\) of a real-valued input signal \(x(t) \in [-1,1]\), regularly sampled at sampling rate \(sr\). \(\Delta t=1/sr\) is the sample duration, and \(\alpha \in [0,1]\) is a constant parameter that dictates how much each new measurement affects the accumulated value.

\[P \leftarrow P e^{-i \omega \Delta t}\]

\[R \leftarrow (1-\alpha) R + \alpha x P\]

The two complex numbers \(P\) and \(R\) capture the full state of the resonator. Updating the state at each input signal sample only requires a handful of arithmetic operations. Calculating the power and/or magnitude is not necessary for the update, and can be carried out only when required by the application, relatively efficiently as well.
The single parameter \(\alpha\), which can be related to a time constant, governs the dynamics of the system. For the frequency range of interest in audio applications (20-20000 Hz), the function \(\alpha_f = 1-e^{-\Delta t\frac{f}{log(1+f)} }\) is a reasonable heuristic.
The smoothed state \(\tilde{R}\) is produced by applying the EMWA to \(R\) with the same \(\alpha\) to dampen power and phase oscillations.
Finally, the output of each resonator is optionally normalized by the total response across the bank to a step signal of the resonator’s frequency (equalization).Banks of resonators, independently tuned to perceptually relevant frequency scales, compute an instantaneous, perceptually relevant estimate of the spectral content of an input signal in real-time.
Both memory and per-sample computational complexity of such a bank are linear in the number of resonators, and independent of the number of input samples processed, or duration of processed signal.
Furthermore, since the resonators are independent, there is no constraint on the tuning of their resonant frequencies or time constants, and all  computations can be parallelized across resonators.
In an offline processing context, the cumulative computational cost for a given duration increases linearly with the number of input samples processed.Spectral information as a function of time is typically presented graphically for human consumption in the form of a spectrogram, in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents frequency. The value at each point represents the power of the frequency in the input signal at the given time slice. These values are usually normalized by the maximum value over the signal, and mapped to a logarithmic color scale to produce plots like those shown below.
A Resonate oscillator bank with adequately tuned resonators computes an arbitrary frequency scale spectrogram directly and efficiently, with more relevant frequency resolution and much higher temporal resolutiont than FFT-based methods.Alexandre R.J. François,

It can be fun to be in opposition, to harangue or even to use power to change someone’s position.An argument, though, is an exchange of ideas that ought to surface insight and lead to a conclusion.If you’re regularly having arguments with well-informed people of goodwill, you will probably ‘lose’ half of them–changing your mind based on what you’ve learned. If you’re not changing your mind, it’s likely you’re not actually having an argument (or you’re hanging out with the wrong people.) While it can be fun to change someone else’s position, it’s also a gift to learn enough to change ours.The toddler puts on a show of having an argument, but they are holding a tantrum in reserve. If they ‘win’ the argument, no tantrum is needed. If they lose, they can tell themselves that they tried but the other person deserved the tantrum because they didn’t listen.“Tell me about other strongly-held positions you’ve changed as the result of a discussion like this one…” is a direct way to start a conversation about the argument you’re proposing to have. “What sort of information would make it likely you could see this in a different way?”It probably doesn’t pay to argue over things we have chosen to believe as part of our identity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Three Key Ways Trump Can Cut Medicaid Funding | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQwkhpNhwho</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vQwkhpNhwho?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 14:01:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Medicaid covers more than 70 million low-income people in the U.S., the largest public health insurance program in the country.

75% of all new infectious diseases, like Ebola, AIDS, and COVID-19 come from animals. As we destroy forests and go deeper into wild habitats, we increase the risk of those diseases being transmitted to humans. This is how pandemics begin. 

Here’s how to reduce the risk of future pandemics: 

✔️ Limit unnecessary contact with wild animals 
✔️ Avoid eating wild or unknown animal meat 
✔️ Practice good hygiene, like washing your hands regularly and boiling drinking water 
✔️ Protect yourself against mosquito bites 
✔️ And most importantly: preserve the rainforest 🌳

Our system combines three key components: an Agentic innovation lab generating high-quality product concepts, synthetic consumer panels using fine-tuned foundational models validated against historical data, and an evaluation framework that correlates with real-world testing outcomes. We can talk about how this architecture enables rapid concept discovery and digital experimentation, delivering insights into product success probability before development begins. Through case studies and technical deep-dives, you'll learn how we built an AI powered innovation lab that compresses months of product development and testing into minutes - without sacrificing the accuracy of insights.With over 15 years of leadership experience in AI, data science, and analytics, Luca has driven transformative growth in technology-first businesses.

DESCRIPTION
OpenSAFELY represents a revolutionary approach to medical research that prioritizes patient privacy while enabling valuable insights from healthcare data. Rather than giving researchers direct access to sensitive GP records, it allows them to submit code that runs in a secure environment, with only privacy-checked aggregated results returned.

Hannes Lowette talks to Eli Holderness about how the system works, its benefits for ensuring reproducible science, the challenges of working with data not collected for research purposes, and its potential applications beyond healthcare. The approach balances the need for medical research with strict privacy protections, ensuring patients maintain trust in how their sensitive data is used.

The attackers reportedly exploited outdated PHP code and deprecated MySQL functions in 4chan's backend, particularly in a core script named yotsuba.php, which manages post submissions and moderation. A Soyjak.Party users also shared a list of emails they claimed are associated with janitor and moderator accounts, including three .edu emails. Although some internet users claimed that the leaks included .gov emails associated with members of the moderation team, this remains unverified.4chan was reportedly hacked by internet users claiming to be part of the Soyjak.Party community on April 14th, 2025. The hackers brought back the deleted /QA/ board, and temporarily granted access to 4chan's administrative site. An anonymous user posted about the hack on Soyjak.Party around 10:05 PM EST. The thread contained several bits of leaked information, a look into the /j/ board as well as the entirety of the "yotsuba.php" code, which handles features like posting and reporting. Another post in the thread claimed to be leaking the email addresses associated with various janitors, three of which were .edu emails.Early on April 15th, 2025, KiwiFarms user Coberald posted a copy of the leaked 4chan source code. A user named Tofflenheim also shared a link to an archive of posts on /j/, a private board dedicated to janitor discussions.X user @Priniz_twt was one of the first to post about the hack on April 14th, 2025, gathering over 5,000 likes in less than a day.On April 14th and April 15th, 2025, X user @_yushe posted screenshots from the 4chan administrative page as well as analyzed the leaked "yotsuba.php" code, which handles features like posting and reporting. The post gathered over 500 likes in less than a day.On April 15th, X user @_yushe noted that 4chan was likely hacked because it was using an outdated version of PHP (a coding language used to run the site), which is full of known vulnerabilities, and deprecated (no longer supported) functions to handle its database.Also on April 14th, X user @LumpyTheCook tweeted, "Apparently 4chan is down because someone hacked the lead admin (Hiro) account and started leaking all the mod and janitor emails, contact info, chat logs, etc. Good job Hiro 👍" The thread also included the unconfirmed claim that some janitors were using .gov emails, (although some leaked lists did contained .edu emails).On April 15th, 2025, Redditor /u/Meteorstar101 posted to the /r/greentext subreddit, writing, "Last posts before 4chan got hacked," and showing the Chicken Jockey meme.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Whistleblower details how DOGE may have taken sensitive NLRB data</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security</link><author>rbanffy</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 10:55:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
                The DOGE team may have taken data related to union organizing and labor complaints and hid its tracks, according to a whistleblower.
                In the first days of March, a team of advisers from President Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency initiative arrived at the Southeast Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board.The small, independent federal agency investigates and adjudicates complaints about unfair labor practices. It stores reams of potentially sensitive data, from confidential information about employees who want to form unions to proprietary business information.The DOGE employees, who are effectively led by White House adviser and billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, appeared to have their sights set on accessing the NLRB's internal systems. They've said their unit's overall mission is to review agency data for compliance with the new administration's policies and to cut costs and maximize efficiency.But according to an official whistleblower disclosure shared with Congress and other federal overseers that was obtained by NPR, subsequent interviews with the whistleblower and records of internal communications, technical staff members were alarmed about what DOGE engineers did when they were granted access, particularly when those staffers noticed a spike in data leaving the agency. It's possible that the data included sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases and corporate secrets — data that four labor law experts tell NPR should almost never leave the NLRB and that has nothing to do with making the government more efficient or cutting spending.Meanwhile, according to the disclosure and records of internal communications, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access — evasive behavior that several cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR compared to what criminal or state-sponsored hackers might do.

                The employees grew concerned that the NLRB's confidential data could be exposed, particularly after they started detecting suspicious log-in attempts from an IP address in Russia, according to the disclosure. Eventually, the disclosure continued, the IT department launched a formal review of what it deemed a serious, ongoing security breach or potentially illegal removal of personally identifiable information. The whistleblower believes that the suspicious activity warrants further investigation by agencies with more resources, like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or the FBI.The labor law experts interviewed by NPR fear that if the data gets out, it could be abused, including by private companies with cases before the agency that might get insights into damaging testimony, union leadership, legal strategies and internal data on competitors — Musk's SpaceX among them. It could also intimidate whistleblowers who might speak up about unfair labor practices, and it could sow distrust in the NLRB's independence, they said.The new revelations about DOGE's activities at the labor agency come from a whistleblower in the IT department of the NLRB, who disclosed his concerns to Congress and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel in a detailed report that was then provided to NPR. Meanwhile, his attempts to raise concerns internally within the NLRB preceded someone "physically taping a threatening note" to his door that included sensitive personal information and overhead photos of him walking his dog that appeared to be taken with a drone, according to a cover letter attached to his disclosure filed by his attorney, Andrew Bakaj of the nonprofit Whistleblower Aid.The whistleblower's account is corroborated by internal documentation and was reviewed by 11 technical experts across other government agencies and the private sector. In total, NPR spoke to over 30 sources across the government, the private sector, the labor movement, cybersecurity and law enforcement who spoke to their own concerns about how DOGE and the Trump administration might be handling sensitive data, and the implications for its exposure. Much of the following account comes from the whistleblower's official disclosure and interviews with NPR."I can't attest to what their end goal was or what they're doing with the data," said the whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, in an interview with NPR. "But I can tell you that the bits of the puzzle that I can quantify are scary. ... This is a very bad picture we're looking at."Tim Bearese, the NLRB's acting press secretary, denied that the agency granted DOGE access to its systems and said DOGE had not requested access to the agency's systems. Bearese said the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but "determined that no breach of agency systems occurred."Notwithstanding the NLRB's denial, the whistleblower's disclosure to Congress and other federal overseers includes forensic data and records of conversations with colleagues that provide evidence of DOGE's access and activities. Meanwhile, NPR's extensive reporting makes clear that DOGE's access to data is a widespread concern. Across the government, 11 sources directly familiar with internal operations in federal agencies and in Congress told NPR that they share Berulis' concerns, and some have seen other evidence that DOGE is exfiltrating sensitive data for unknown reasons.After this story published, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, "It is months-old news that President Trump signed an Executive Order to hire DOGE employees at agencies and coordinate data sharing. Their highly-qualified team has been extremely public and transparent in its efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse across the Executive Branch, including the NLRB."Taking apart computers to protecting government dataInstead of a brand-new car for a 16th-birthday present, Berulis got his first computer.It's a familiar story for tech nerds the world over: He methodically took the machine apart "to figure out how it works," just like he had dissected radios from the thrift store years earlier. "I electrocuted myself once," he recalled.Berulis was always interested in public service, but the traditional paths didn't suit him.A knee injury prevented him from joining the military. He served as a volunteer firefighter for a period and donated his time working for a local rape crisis hotline, answering calls from victims in need of someone to listen. But, he told NPR, "I had an interest in serving my country."Berulis had been a technical consultant for many years, including in auditing and modernizing corporate systems, when a job opened up at the National Labor Relations Board.
                Daniel Berulis started working at the National Labor Relations Board about six months before President Trump started his second term.
                While he didn't know much about the agency, Berulisquickly found its mission to protect employees' rights in line with his long-standing desire "to help people."He started about six months before President Trump was inaugurated for his second term this past January. Berulis said he hit the ground running, securing the NLRB's cloud-based data servers and reinforcing what's called "zero trust" principles, which means that users can get access only to the parts of the system they need in order to do their jobs — no more, no less. That way, if an attacker gets hold of a single username and password, the attacker can't access the whole system."When I first started, it was a dream come true," he said. "There was a great opportunity to build up and do some good." But after the inauguration, he described a "culture of fear" descending over the agency.The first week of March, engineers associated with DOGE arrived at the NLRB's headquarters, according to Berulis' disclosure. Beforehand, they had asked about what software, hardware, programming languages and applications the NLRB was using. DOGE learned that it used commercially available cloud infrastructure that businesses typically use, which connects to government cloud systems at other agencies and can be accessed remotely.Berulis said he and several colleagues saw a black SUV and police escort enter the garage, after which building security let the DOGE staffers in. They interacted with a small number of staffers, never introducing themselves to most of the IT team.Berulis says he was told by colleagues that DOGE employees demanded the highest level of access, what are called "tenant owner level" accounts inside the independent agency's computer systems, with essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy and alter data, according to Berulis' disclosure.When an IT staffer suggested a streamlined process to activate those accounts in a way that would let their activities be tracked, in accordance with NLRB security policies, the IT staffers were told to stay out of DOGE's way, the disclosure continues.For cybersecurity professionals, a failure to log activity is a cardinal sin and contradicts best practices as recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as the FBI and the National Security Agency."That was a huge red flag," said Berulis. "That's something that you just don't do. It violates every core concept of security and best practice."Those forensic digital records are important for record-keeping requirements and they allow for troubleshooting, but they also allow experts to investigate potential breaches, sometimes even tracing the attacker's path back to the vulnerability that let them inside a network. The records can also help experts see what data might have been removed. Basic logs would likely not be enough to demonstrate the extent of a bad actor's activities, but it would be a start. There's no reason for any legitimate user to turn off logging or other security tools, cybersecurity experts say."None of this is normal," said Jake Braun, the executive director of the Cyber Policy Initiative at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy and former acting principal deputy national cyber director at the White House, in an interview with NPR about the whistleblower's disclosure. "This type of activity is why the government buys insider-threat-monitoring technology. So we can know things like this are happening and stop sensitive data exfiltration before it happens," he told NPR.However, the NLRB's budget hasn't had the money to pay for tools like that for years, Berulis said.A backdoor to government systems?A couple of days after DOGE arrived, Berulis saw something else that alarmed him while browsing the internet over the weekend.Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and DOGE engineer Jordan Wick had been sharing information about coding projects he was working on to his public account with GitHub, a website that allows developers to create, store and collaborate on code.After journalist Roger Sollenberger started posting on X about the account, Berulis noticed something Wick was working on: a project, or repository, titled "NxGenBdoorExtract."Wick made it private before Berulis could investigate further, he told NPR. But to Berulis, the title itself was revealing."So when I saw this tool, I immediately panicked, just for lack of a better term," he said. "I kind of had a conniption and said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'" He immediately alerted his whole team.While NPR was unable to recover the code for that project, the name itself suggests that Wick could have been designing a backdoor, or "Bdoor," to extract files from the NLRB's internal case management system, known as NxGen, according to several cybersecurity experts who reviewed Berulis' conclusions.Wick did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.

The name itself suggests that Wick could have been designing a backdoor, or "Bdoor," to extract files from the NLRB's internal case management system.

                "It definitely seems rather odd to name it that," said one of the engineers who built NxGen and asked for anonymity so as not to jeopardize their ability to work with the government again. "Or brazen, if you're not worried about consequences.""The whole idea of removing logging and [getting] tenant-level access is the most disturbing part to me," the engineer said.NxGen is an internal system that was designed specifically for the NLRB in-house, according to several of the engineers who created the tool and who all spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation or adverse consequences for any future government work.The engineers explained that while many of the NLRB's records are eventually made public, the NxGen case management system hosts proprietary data from corporate competitors, personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, and witness testimony in ongoing cases. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including the Privacy Act.Those engineers were also concerned by DOGE staffers' insistence that their activities not be logged, allowing them to probe the NLRB's systems and discover information about potential security flaws or vulnerabilities without being detected."If he didn't know the backstory, any [chief information security officer] worth his salt would look at network activity like this and assume it's a nation-state attack from China or Russia," said Braun, the former White House cyber official.Putting the puzzle pieces togetherAbout a week after arriving, the DOGE engineers had left the NLRB and deleted their accounts, according to Berulis' disclosure to Congress.In the office, Berulis had had limited visibility into what the DOGE team was up to in real time.That's partly because, he said, the NLRB isn't advanced when it comes to detecting insider threats or potentially malicious actors inside the agency itself. "We as an agency have not evolved to account for those," he explained. "We were looking for [bad actors] outside," he said.But he counted on DOGE leaving at least a few traces of its activity behind, puzzle pieces he could assemble to try to put together a picture of what happened — details he included in his official disclosure.Then, DOGE engineers installed what's called a "container," a kind of opaque virtual computer that can run programs on a machine without revealing its activities to the rest of the network. On its own, that wouldn't be suspicious, though it did allow the engineers to work invisibly and left no trace of its activities once it was removed.Then, Berulis started tracking sensitive data leaving the places it's meant to live, according to his official disclosure. First, he saw a chunk of data exiting the NxGen case management system's "nucleus," inside the NLRB system, Berulis explained. Then, he saw a large spike in outbound traffic leaving the network itself.
                This screenshot shows a large spike in outbound traffic leaving the NLRB system.
                From what he could see, the data leaving, almost all text files, added up to around 10 gigabytes — or the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias if someone printed them, he explained. It's a sizable chunk of the total data in the NLRB system, though the agency itself hosts over 10 terabytes in historical data. It's unclear which files were copied and removed or whether they were consolidated and compressed, which could mean even more data was exfiltrated. It's also possible that DOGE ran queries looking for specific files in the NLRB's system and took only what it was looking for, according to the disclosure.Regardless, that kind of spike is extremely unusual, Berulis explained, because data almost never directly leaves from the NLRB's databases. In his disclosure, Berulis shared a screenshot tracking data entering and exiting the system, and there's only one noticeable spike of data going out. He also confirmed that no one at the NLRB had been saving backup files that week or migrating data for any projects.Even when external parties like lawyers or overseers like the inspector general are granted guest accounts on the system, it's only to view the files relevant to their case or investigation, explained labor law experts who worked with or at the NLRB, in interviews with NPR."None of that confidential and deliberative information should ever leave the agency," said Richard Griffin, who was the NLRB general counsel from 2013 to 2017, in an interview with NPR."We are under assault right now"For cybersecurity experts, that spike in data leaving the system is a key indicator of a breach, Berulis explained."We are under assault right now," he remembered thinking.When Berulis asked his IT colleagues whether they knew why the data was exfiltrated or whether anyone else had been using containers to run code on the system in recent weeks, no one knew anything about it or the other unusual activities on the network, according to his disclosure. In fact, when they looked into the spike, they found that logs that were used to monitor outbound traffic from the system were absent. Some actions taken on the network, including data exfiltration, had no attribution — except to a "deleted account," he continued. "Nobody knows who deleted the logs or how they could have gone missing," Berulissaid.The IT team met to discuss insider threats — namely, the DOGE engineers, whose activities it had little insight into or control over. "We had no idea what they did," he explained. Those conversations are reflected in his official disclosure.They eventually launched a formal breach investigation, according to the disclosure, and prepared a request for assistance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). However, those efforts were disrupted without an explanation, Berulis said. That was deeply troubling to Berulis, who felt he needed help to try to get to the bottom of what happened and determine what new vulnerabilities might be exploited as a result.In the days after Berulis and his colleagues prepared a request for CISA's help investigating the breach, Berulis found a printed letter in an envelope taped to his door, which included threatening language, sensitive personal information and overhead pictures of him walking his dog, according to the cover letter attached to his official disclosure. It's unclear who sent it, but the letter made specific reference to his decision to report the breach. Law enforcement is investigating the letter."If the underlying disclosure wasn't concerning enough, the targeted, physical intimidation and surveillance of my client is. If this is happening to Mr. Berulis, it is likely happening to others and brings our nation more in line with authoritarian regimes than with open and free democracies," wrote Bakaj, his attorney, in a statement sent to NPR. "It is time for everyone – and Congress in particular – to acknowledge the facts and stop our democracy, freedom, and liberties from slipping away, something that will take generations to repair."In part because of the stymied internal investigation and the attempts to silence him, Berulis decided to come forward publicly.In fact, despite all that, Berulis managed to uncover some stranger and more troubling details about what happened while DOGE was logged on, which he enumerated in his official declaration.Unknown users also gave themselves a high-level access key, what's called a SAS token, meaning "shared access signature," to access storage accounts, before deleting it. Berulis said there was no way to track what they did with it.Someone had disabled controls that would prevent insecure or unauthorized mobile devices from logging on to the system without the proper security settings. There was an interface exposed to the public internet, potentially allowing malicious actors access to the NLRB's systems. Internal alerting and monitoring systems were found to be manually turned off. Multifactor authentication was disabled. And Berulis noticed that an unknown user had exported a "user roster," a file with contact information for outside lawyers who have worked with the NLRB.Berulis said he noticed five PowerShell downloads on the system, a task automation program that would allow engineers to run automated commands. There were several code libraries that got his attention — tools that he said appeared to be designed to automate and mask data exfiltration. There was a tool to generate a seemingly endless number of IP addresses called "requests-ip-rotator," and a commonly used automation tool for web developers called "browserless" — both repositories starred or favorited by Wick, the DOGE engineer, according to an archive of his GitHub account reviewed by NPR.While investigating the data taken from the agency, Berulis tried to determine its ultimate destination. But whoever had exfiltrated it had disguised its destination too, according to the disclosure.DOGE staffers had permission to access the system, but removing data is another matter.Berulis says someone appeared to be doing something called DNS tunneling to prevent the data exfiltration from being detected. He came to that conclusion, outlined in his disclosure, after he saw a traffic spike in DNS requests parallel to the data being exfiltrated, a spike 1,000 times the normal number of requests.When someone uses this kind of technique, they set up a domain name that pings the target system with questions or queries. But they configure the compromised server so that it answers those DNS queries by sending out packets of data, allowing the attacker to steal information that has been broken down into smaller chunks."We've seen Russian threat actors do things like this on U.S. government systems," said one threat intelligence researcher who requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly by their employer. That analyst, who has extensive experience hunting nation-state-sponsored hackers, reviewed the whistleblower's technical claims."The difference is, they were given the keys to the front door," the researcher continued. While the researcher clarified that it would be difficult to fully verify what happened without full access to the NLRB system, they said Berulis' conclusions and accompanying evidence were a cause for concern. "None of this is standard," they said.Russ Handorf, who served in the FBI for a decade in various cybersecurity roles, also reviewed Berulis' extensive technical forensic records and analysis and spoke to NPR about his conclusions."All of this is alarming," he said. "If this was a publicly traded company, I would have to report this [breach] to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The timeline of events demonstrates a lack of respect for the institution and for the sensitivity of the data that was exfiltrated. There is no reason to increase the security risk profile by disabling security controls and exposing them, less guarded, to the internet. They didn't exercise the more prudent standard practice of copying the data to encrypted and local media for escort.""Until there's an investigation done, there's no way to definitively prove who did it," Handorf concluded."No reason whatsoever for accessing the information"

                DOGE's intentions with regard to the NLRB data remain unclear. Many of the systems that DOGE embedded itself in across the rest of the government have payment or employment data, information that it could use to evaluate which grants and programs to halt and whom to fire.But the case management system is very different.It houses information about ongoing contested labor cases, lists of union activists, internal case notes, personal information from Social Security numbers to home addresses, proprietary corporate data and more information that never gets published openly.Experts interviewed by NPR acknowledge that there are inefficiencies across government that warrant further review, but they say they don't see a single legitimate reason that DOGE staffers would need to remove the data from the case management system to resolve those problems."There is no reason whatsoever for accessing the information. Now, could any agency be more efficient? More effective? Positively. But what you need for that is people who understand what the agency does. That is not by mining data, putting algorithms in and creating a breach of security," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in labor and information technology."There is nothing that I can see about what DOGE is doing that follows any of the standard procedures for how you do an audit that has integrity and that's meaningful and will actually produce results that serve the normal auditing function, which is to look for fraud, waste and abuse," said Sharon Block, the executive director of Harvard Law School's Center for Labor and a Just Economy and a former NLRB board member."The mismatch between what they're doing and the established, professional way to do what they say they're doing ... that just kind of gives away the store, that they are not actually about finding more efficient ways for the government to operate," Block said.For labor law experts, the mere possibility that sensitive records were copied is a serious danger that could create a chilling effect for employees everywhere who turn to the National Labor Relations Board for protection."Just saying that they have access to the data is intimidating," said Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor education research at Cornell University and co-director of the Worker Empowerment Research Network. "People are going to go, 'I'm not going to testify before the board because, you know, my employer might get access.'"Bronfenbrenner, the child of immigrant parents who fled the Soviet Union and Nazi-controlled Germany, said she spends a lot of time thinking about how systems can crumble under the right circumstances. "You know, there's this belief that we have these checks and balances … but anyone who's part of the labor movement should know that's not true," she told NPR.With access to the data, it would make it easier for companies to fire employees for union organizing or keep blacklists of organizers — illegal activities under federal labor laws enforced by the NLRB. But "people get fired in this country all the time for the lawful act of trying to organize a union," said Block.Having a copy of the opposing counsel's notes as companies prepare for legal challenges would also be an attractive possibility, she continued.It's not just employees who might suffer if this data got out. Companies also sometimes provide detailed statements on internal business planning and corporate structure in the midst of unfair-labor-practice complaint proceedings. If a company was attempting to fire someone who it alleged had disclosed trade secrets and was fighting an unfair-labor-practice complaint based around that decision, those trade secrets might come up in the board's investigation too. That information would be valuable to competitors, regulators and others.Overall, the potential exposure of the NLRB's data could have serious implications."I think it is very concerning," said Shaiken. "It could result in damage to individual workers, to union-organizing campaigns and to unions themselves," he said."It is bringing a wrecking ball into the dentist office, meaning this is wildly disproportionate and raises real dangers," Shaiken continued.A conflict of interest and the dangers of exposureLabor law experts were particularly concerned about what they described as clear conflicts of interest, particularly when it comes to Elon Musk, his companies and his vast network of former employees and allies who are now getting access to government jobs and data.Trump and Musk, during an interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity, said Musk would recuse himself from anything involving his companies. "I haven't asked the president for anything ever," Musk said. "I'm getting a sort of a daily proctology exam here. You know, it's not like I'll be getting away [with] something in the dead of night." However, DOGE has been granted high-level access to a lot of data that could benefit Musk, and there has been no evidence of a firewall preventing misuse of that data.There are multiple ongoing cases involving Musk and the NLRB. For one, after a group of former SpaceX employees lodged a complaint with the NLRB, lawyers representing SpaceX, some of whom were recently hired into government jobs, filed suit against the NLRB. They argued that the agency's structure is unconstitutional.
                Elon Musk speaks with then-President-elect Donald Trump and guests at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on Nov. 19, 2024, in Brownsville, Texas.

                Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. raised his concerns about Musk accessing sensitive labor investigation data on cases against his companies or competitors during the confirmation hearing for Trump's labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, in mid-February. He pressed her to answer whether she believed the NLRB is constitutional and to commit to keeping sensitive data confidential. While she said she was committed to "privacy" and said she respects the NLRB's "authority," she insisted that Trump "has the executive power to exercise it as he sees fit."All this is happening in the context of a broader attempt by the White House to hamstring labor agencies.The NLRB was created "to guarantee workers' rights to organize and to address problems that workers have in the workplace," said Shaiken, of UC Berkeley. Under President Joe Biden, he recalled, the labor movement enjoyed an unusual amount of support from Washington. "But what we have seen is a sharp slamming of the brakes to that and putting the vehicle in reverse in terms of what Trump has done so far," he continued.In addition to sending DOGE to the NLRB, the Trump administration tried to neutralize the board's power to enforce labor law by removing its member Gwynne Wilcox. Courts have gone back and forth on whether Wilcox's removal was illegal, as presidents are meant to demonstrate cause for dismissal of independent board members.Representatives of DOGE and former colleagues of Musk's who have been installed across the federal government have failed to reassure the public or the courts that they have taken the proper precautions to protect the data they're ingesting and that private business interests won't influence how that data is used or what policy decisions are made, Block and the other labor law experts interviewed by NPR say."It's not that he's a random person who's getting information that a random person shouldn't have access to," said Harvard Law's Block. "But if they really did get everything, then he has information about the cases the government is building against him," she said."DOGE is, whether they admit it or not, headed by somebody who is the subject of active investigation and prosecution of cases. It is incredibly troubling," she said.Musk's company xAI could also benefit from sucking up all the data DOGE has collected to train its algorithms. Cybersecurity experts like Bruce Schneier, a well-known cryptographer and adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, have pointed to this concern at length in interviews and written pieces.According to two federal government sources who were not authorized to speak publicly about their workplaces and who shared email documentation with NPR, managers have consistently been warning employees that their data could be subject to AI review, particularly their email responses to the Musk-led campaign to get federal employees to detail "what they did last week" in five bullet points every Monday."It's not a flight of imagination to see several DOGE staffers release some of that [data] surreptitiously to Musk or people close to him," said Shaiken.If the data isn't properly protected after it leaves the agency or if DOGE left a digital door open to the agency itself, data could also be exposed to potential sale or theft by criminals or foreign adversaries. An attacker could also try to take advantage of the connections between the NLRB's cloud account and other government cloud environments, using their access to the NLRB as a foothold to move to other networks."Both criminals and foreign adversaries traditionally have used information like this to enrich themselves through a variety of actions," explained Handorf, the former FBI cyber official. "That includes blackmail, targeting and prioritizing intellectual property theft for espionage or even harming a company to enrich another."Within minutes after DOGE accessed the NLRB's systems, someone with an IP address in Russia started trying to log in, according to Berulis' disclosure. The attempts were "near real-time," according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis. While it's possible the user was disguising their location, it's highly unlikely they'd appear to be coming from Russia if they wanted to avoid suspicion, cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR explained.On their own, a few failed login attempts from a Russian IP address aren't a smoking gun, those cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR said. But given the overall picture of activity, it's a concerning sign that foreign adversaries may already be searching for ways into government systems that DOGE engineers may have left exposed."When you move fast and break stuff, the opportunity to ride the coattails of authorized access is ridiculously easy to achieve," said Handorf. What he means is that if DOGE engineers left access points to the network open, it would be very easy for spies or criminals to break in and steal data behind DOGE.He said he could also see foreign adversaries trying to recruit or pay DOGE team members for access to sensitive data. "It would not surprise me if DOGE is accidentally compromised.""This is exactly why we usually architect systems using best practices like the principle of least privilege," Ann Lewis, the former director of Technology Transformation Services at the General Services Administration, told NPR in an interview. "The principle of least privilege is a fundamental cybersecurity concept … that states that users should have only the minimum rights, roles and permissions required to perform their roles and responsibilities. This protects access to high-value data and critical assets and helps prevent unauthorized access, accidental damage from user errors and malicious actions. "Bakaj, Berulis' lawyer, told NPR in a written statement: "This case has been particularly sensitive as it involves the possibility of sophisticated foreign intelligence gaining access to sensitive government systems, which is why we went to the Senate Intelligence Committee directly."The NLRB isn't alone in those concerns.In over a dozen lawsuits in federal courts around the country, judges have demanded that DOGE explain why it needs such expansive access to sensitive data on Americans, from Social Security records to private medical records and tax information. But the Trump administration has been unable to give consistent and clear answers, largely dismissing cybersecurity and privacy concerns.In one case dealing with Treasury Department payment systems that control trillions of dollars in federal spending, U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas blocked DOGE access on Feb. 21, finding "a real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law."It's an area of focus for Democratic lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
                U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas blocked DOGE access to the Treasury Department over the possibility that "sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department."
                An aide for the Democratic minority on the House Oversight Committee who was not authorized to speak publicly told NPR that the committee is in possession of multiple verifiable reports showing that DOGE has exfiltrated sensitive government data across agencies for unknown purposes, revealing that Berulis' disclosure is not an isolated incident.But government cybersecurity officials are already resigning or being fired, forced to relocate or put on administrative leave all over the federal government, from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to the Interior Department. That has limited their power to respond to the ongoing disruptions or keep track of what DOGE is doing.One of the first people to speak out about DOGE's access to sensitive data was Erie Meyer, who resigned as the chief technology officer at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in February. She has provided testimony in ongoing court cases surrounding DOGE's access and also spoke to NPR in an interview. The CFPB has sensitive and potentially market-moving data. Meyer said DOGE employees granted themselves "God-tier" access to the CFPB's systems, turned off auditing and event logs and put the cybersecurity experts responsible for insider threat detection on administrative leave. When IT experts at the CFPB planned to conduct an "after action" report on DOGE's activities, they were stonewalled, she continued.When she heard about how DOGE engineers operated at the NLRB, particularly the steps they took to obfuscate their activities, she recognized a pattern."I am trembling," she said upon hearing about the potential exposure of data from the NLRB. "They can get every piece of whistleblower testimony, every report, everything. This is not good."Other technical employees working with government agencies who spoke to NPR shared Berulis' concerns."Our cyber teams are pissed because they have to sit on their hands when every single alarm system we have regarding insider threats is going off," said one employee at an agency of the Interior Department who requested anonymity, fearing retribution. Cybersecurity teams wanted to shut off new users' access to the system, the employee continued, but were ordered to stand down.Meanwhile, in a letter published on March 13 on Federal News Network, 46 former senior officials from the General Services Administration, one of the government agencies hardest hit by DOGE's cost-cutting efforts and that oversees nearly all federal buildings and purchasing, wrote that they believed "highly-sensitive IT systems are being put at risk and sensitive information is being downloaded to unknown, unvetted external sources in clear violation of privacy and data-protection rules."The Trump administration could be trying to codify DOGE's practices into how the government shares information, said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of nonprofit public interest law firm National Security Counselors, who is representing federal employees in a lawsuit concerning the Office of Personnel Management's use of a private email server.Weeks after DOGE staffers descended on federal buildings across Washington, Trump issued an executive order urging increased data sharing "by eliminating information silos" in what's seen by experts like McClanahan as an attempt to give DOGE engineers further top cover in accessing and amalgamating sensitive federal data, despite laws concerning privacy and cybersecurity."The entire reason we have a Privacy Act is that Congress realized 50 years ago that the federal government was just overflowing with information about normal everyday people and needed some guardrails in place," McClanahan told NPR. "The information silos are there for a reason," he continued. "It's astonishing to me that the very people who not a handful of years ago were screaming about the government tracking us with vaccines now cheer for feeding every piece of information about themselves into Elon Musk's stupid Skynet."DOGE appears to still be in the process of visiting federal agencies across the country, including just recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to one former government source directly familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to share information they weren't authorized to share. Across the government, it's unclear how much sensitive data has been removed and collected and combined.It's also unclear where the labor data went and who has access to it. But for experts in workers' rights, the threat is immediate and existential."This shocks the conscience," said Richard Griffin, the former general counsel of the NLRB. "And if DOGE operatives captured and removed case files, it could constitute a violation of the Privacy Act."For Berulis, it was important to speak out, because he believes people deserve to know how the government's data and computer systems are at risk, and to prevent further damage. As a former IT consultant, Berulis says he would have been fired for operating like DOGE.
                Daniel Berulis hopes that there might be further investigations into mishandling of sensitive data across the federal government.
                Disclosing his concerns "was a moral imperative at this point," he said. "I've never encountered this in my 20 years of IT."His hope is that there might be further investigations into mishandling of sensitive data across the federal government."I believe with all my heart that this goes far beyond just case data," he said. "I know there are [people] at other agencies who have seen similar behavior. I firmly believe that this is happening maybe even to a greater extent at other agencies."For overseers, investigators and IT experts in a similar position, he hopes to provide a road map of what to look for."It was my goal by disclosing to Congress not to focus on me at all, but to give them information that they might not necessarily have, the things that you don't necessarily look for unless you know where to look," he continued.The NLRB said it would cooperate with any investigations that stem from Berulis' disclosure to Congress."As an agency protecting employee rights, the NLRB respects its employee's right to bring whistleblower claims to Congress and the Office of Special Counsel, and the Agency looks forward to working with those entities to resolve the complaints," said Bearese, the agency's acting spokesperson, in a statement.Berulis had a simple request for the DOGE engineers: "Be transparent. If you have nothing to hide, don't delete logs, don't be covert. ... Be open, because that's what efficiency is really about. If this is all a huge misunderstanding, then just prove it. Put it out there. That's all I'm asking."But ultimately, if the systems that DOGE accesses are left insecure, it might not matter if its intentions are honorable, he concluded."This could just be the start of the operation. ... They still haven't crossed that boundary where they're plugged into every federal system out there," he continued. "So maybe there is still time."NPR's Stephen Fowler contributed reporting.

Traditional  are slow, introduce latency, and often lead to stale data and inconsistencies.Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern used to track and capture changes in a database (inserts, updates, deletes) and stream those changes in real time to downstream systems.This ensures downstream systems remain in sync without needing expensive batch jobs.In this article, we’ll dive into how CDC works, explore different implementation strategies, it’s real-world use cases, challenges and considerations.At a high level, CDC works by continuously monitoring a database for data changes (insertions, updates, and deletions). When a change occurs, CDC captures the change event and makes the information available for processing.The process typically involves: Detecting changes from source systems. This can be achieved through database triggers, reading transaction logs, or using specialized CDC tools. Extracting details about the change event (such as before and after values) along with metadata (e.g., timestamp, changed table). Transmitting the change event to consumers, which might include message queues, data pipelines, or real-time analytics systems.This helps in achieving event-driven architectures where applications respond to data changes as they happen.There are three main approaches to implementing CDC:This approach relies on adding a or column to your database tables. Every time a row is inserted or modified, this column is updated with the current timestamp. Applications then query the table for rows where the  time is later than the last sync time.SELECT * FROM orders WHERE last_updated > '2024-02-15 12:00:00'; Easy to implement without major changes to the database architecture.No External Dependencies: Can be executed with basic SQL operations, making it accessible for smaller projects or legacy systems. This method may not capture deleted records since the timestamp is typically updated on existing rows. As your data grows, frequent querying based on timestamps can impact performance, especially if indexing is not optimally configured. Misconfigured timestamp updates or clock skew issues can result in missed changes.Trigger-Based CDC involves setting up database triggers that automatically log changes to a separate audit table whenever an insert, update, or delete operation occurs. This audit table then serves as a reliable source of change records, which can be pushed to other systems as needed.CREATE TRIGGER order_changes 
AFTER UPDATE ON orders 
FOR EACH ROW 
INSERT INTO order_audit (order_id, old_status, new_status, changed_at) 
VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.status, NEW.status, NOW()); Triggers capture changes immediately when they occur. Offers a granular record of changes, including before-and-after values, which is useful for audit trails and debugging. Can be tailored to capture specific columns or changes. Triggers execute during the transaction, potentially slowing down database write operations.Complexity in Maintenance: Changes in database schema often require corresponding updates to trigger definitions. In high-transaction environments, the additional load of maintaining an audit table can become significant.Log-Based CDC reads changes directly from the database’s  or . This method intercepts the low-level database operations, enabling it to capture every change made to the database without interfering with the application’s normal workflow. An open-source platform that streams database changes. Often used in conjunction with Debezium to integrate with Apache Kafka. A managed service for data migration and CDC in the cloud. Minimizes the impact on the primary database since it leverages existing logs. Well-suited for large, high-transaction environments.Comprehensive Change Capture: Accurately captures every change, including inserts, updates, and deletes. Provides near real-time data movement, essential for dynamic data-driven systems. May require additional configuration and understanding of the underlying database logs.Dependency on Database Features: Not all databases expose their logs in a manner that is easy to consume. Often necessitates integration with additional tools or services, which can add to the overall system complexity.In modern applications, Log-based CDC is generally preferred because it efficiently captures all types of changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) directly from transaction logs, minimizes impact on the primary database, and scales well with high data volumes.3.1. Microservices CommunicationIn a microservices architecture, individual services often need to communicate and share state changes without being tightly coupled. With CDC in place, the change is captured and propagated via a messaging system (such as Kafka) so that each microservice can stay updated on the relevant changes in other services' databases without needing direct service-to-service calls.Event sourcing involves recording every change to an application state as a sequence of events. CDC can be leveraged to capture these changes in real time, building a complete log of all modifications.Consider a financial application that logs every transaction. Instead of simply updating an account’s balance, every deposit, withdrawal, or transfer is recorded as an event. CDC captures these events and builds a detailed log of all state changes. This audit trail can later be used to reconstruct any account’s history or to debug issues.Data warehousing involves consolidating large volumes of transactional data for analysis and reporting. CDC can capture database changes as they happen and push them into a data warehouse in near real-time.Analysts and decision-makers then use up-to-date data for reporting, analytics and dashboards.Caches are used to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data. However, stale cache data can cause issues, leading to outdated or incorrect information being displayed.CDC can trigger cache updates automatically whenever the underlying data changes.An online news platform uses caching to speed up page loads for popular articles. However, when an article is updated (e.g., a correction is issued or new content is added), the cache must be invalidated to prevent serving stale content. With CDC, changes in the content database are captured and automatically trigger cache updates, ensuring readers always see the most current information. is a popular open-source tool that provides log-based CDC for various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.When integrated with Apache Kafka, Debezium can capture and stream database changes in near real time.Step 1: Set Up Kafka and DebeziumBefore configuring Debezium, you need to have a running Kafka cluster.# Start Zookeeper
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties &

# Start Kafka Broker
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties &Step 2: Configure Debezium Connector for MySQLNext, create a Debezium connector configuration to capture changes from your MySQL database. This configuration tells Debezium which database and tables to monitor, along with necessary connection details.{
  "name": "inventory-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.mysql.MySqlConnector",
    "database.hostname": "localhost",
    "database.port": "3306",
    "database.user": "cdc_user",
    "database.password": "password",
    "database.server.id": "184054",
    "database.include.list": "ecommerce",
    "table.include.list": "ecommerce.orders",
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "localhost:9092",
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "dbhistory.inventory"
  }
}Step 3: Listen for ChangesOnce the Debezium connector is properly configured and running, it starts capturing change events from the MySQL database. These events are then published to Kafka topics. You can consume these events using Kafka command-line tools or any Kafka consumer application.bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic dbhistory.inventory --from-beginningWhile CDC is a powerful tool for real-time data integration, its implementation comes with several challenges that must be carefully managed:: Databases evolve over time, with changes such as adding or modifying columns. A robust CDC pipeline must gracefully adapt to schema alterations, ensuring that no data changes are lost or misinterpreted.: In high-transaction environments, large volumes of data changes can occur rapidly. It’s essential to design a CDC system that can process and relay these events efficiently to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.: Maintaining the correct sequence of events is critical, especially in distributed architectures. The CDC solution should ensure that events are processed in the exact order they occurred, preserving data integrity across all consuming services.: Because CDC involves capturing detailed data changes, it can expose sensitive information if not properly managed. Implementing robust security measures such as encryption, data masking, and strict access controls is vital to protect data and comply with regulatory requirements.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

These innovations have made countless people in our country and throughout the world healthier and safer. In recent weeks, the federal government has threatened its partnerships with several universities, including Harvard, over accusations of antisemitism on our campuses. These partnerships are among the most productive and beneficial in American history. New frontiers beckon us with the prospect of life-changing advances—from treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes, to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum science and engineering, and numerous other areas of possibility. For the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation.Late Friday night, the administration issued an updated and expanded list of demands, warning that Harvard must comply if we intend to “maintain [our] financial relationship with the federal government.” It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner. Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the “intellectual conditions” at Harvard.read the letter to gain a fuller understanding of the unprecedented demands being made by the federal government to control the Harvard community. They include requirements to “audit” the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views. We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement. The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.The administration’s prescription goes beyond the power of the federal government. It violates Harvard’s First Amendment rights and exceeds the statutory limits of the government’s authority under Title VI. And it threatens our values as a private institution devoted to the pursuit, production, and dissemination of knowledge. No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.Our motto—Veritas, or truth—guides us as we navigate the challenging path ahead. Seeking truth is a journey without end. It requires us to be open to new information and different perspectives, to subject our beliefs to ongoing scrutiny, and to be ready to change our minds. It compels us to take up the difficult work of acknowledging our flaws so that we might realize the full promise of the University, especially when that promise is threatened.We have made it abundantly clear that we do not take lightly our moral duty to fight antisemitism. Over the past fifteen months, we have taken many steps to address antisemitism on our campus. We plan to do much more. As we defend Harvard, we will continue to: nurture a thriving culture of open inquiry on our campus; develop the tools, skills, and practices needed to engage constructively with one another; and broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community; affirm the rights and responsibilities we share; respect free speech and dissent while also ensuring that protest occurs in a time, place, and manner that does not interfere with teaching, learning, and research; and enhance the consistency and fairness of disciplinary processes; and work together to find ways, consistent with law, to foster and support a vibrant community that exemplifies, respects, and embraces difference. As we do, we will also continue to comply with Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions “on the basis of race.” These ends will not be achieved by assertions of power, unmoored from the law, to control teaching and learning at Harvard and to dictate how we operate. The work of addressing our shortcomings, fulfilling our commitments, and embodying our values is ours to define and undertake as a community. Freedom of thought and inquiry, along with the government’s longstanding commitment to respect and protect it, has enabled universities to contribute in vital ways to a free society and to healthier, more prosperous lives for people everywhere. All of us share a stake in safeguarding that freedom. We proceed now, as always, with the conviction that the fearless and unfettered pursuit of truth liberates humanity—and with faith in the enduring promise that America’s colleges and universities hold for our country and our world.Alan M.

In "ChatGPT and the Future of AI", Terry Sejnowski offers a nuanced exploration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and what their future holds. How should we go about understanding LLMs? Do these language models truly understand what they are saying? Or is it possible that what appears to be intelligence in LLMs may be a mirror that merely reflects the intelligence of the interviewer? In his book, Sejnowski, a pioneer in computational approaches to understanding brain function, answers all our urgent questions about this astonishing new technology.

Terrence Joseph Sejnowski is the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies where he directs the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory and is the director of the Crick-Jacobs center for theoretical and computational biology.

Americans have ben rushing to change their cars as President Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts remain in effect despite the deferral of other country-based taxes that were announced last week. 

Analysts are predicting a drop in vehicle sales, higher new and used car prices, and increased industry costs of more than $100 billion dollars. How will you be affected by Trump's new car tariffs?

A glimmer of hope for seriously ill people who have been waiting for years for a donor organ. Behind it all is a notorious network of international organ traffickers.

We have been following the trail for months. At the center is a transplant clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, where patients from Germany and Israel in particular meet donors from countries in the Caucasus such as Azerbaijan. There are also young Kenyans who are persuaded that they are getting a good deal at 4,000 euros for a kidney. Recipients pay up to €200,000 ($222,000 USD) to organ traffickers. There are many indications that local authorities are looking the other way and that politicians are covering up the trade.

Today we're launching ActorCore (https://actorcore.org/), a stateful serverless framework that enables deploying Cloudflare Durable Object-like workloads to any cloud.If you're unfamiliar with stateful serverless: it's like the actor model, where each actor maintains its own isolated, persistent state. (Think Lambda functions with local storage & runs indefinitely.) It enables easily building long-running, realtime, durable, or local-first backends with the flexibility of serverless infrastructure. The most widely used implementation is Cloudflare Durable Objects, powering products like Clerk, Tldraw, Liveblocks, and Playroom.- Vendor lock-in: Developers are hesitant to adopt a new programming model if there's no clear off-ramp. While it's straightforward to migrate a Postgres database, stateful serverless platforms can feel locked-in due to lack of viable alternatives.- Ecosystem: Choosing a well-known database like Postgres comes with a mature ecosystem. Adopting a new model means rebuilding tooling and patterns from scratch.- Conceptual gap: Many developers have spent their entire careers designing systems with intentionally separated state and compute. A model that merges the two can feel backwards at first.We realized the best solution was to build a stateful serverless framework that can (a) be portable across clouds and (b) be easily extended – similar to how Hono created a unified API for traditional serverless functions across different providers. Thus, ActorCore was born.Today, ActorCore supports running stateful serverless on Rivet Actors, Cloudflare Durable Objects, Redis, and standalone Node.js/Bun. The most common use cases include applications using collaborative, AI agent, local-first, and per-tenant database features.State in ActorCore is an in-memory JavaScript object, with SQLite support coming later this month. State is stored in memory near your users on the edge, removing database round trips and minimizing latency due to physical distance. Additionally, state writes have tunable consistency, which enables both fully durable compute workloads and high-frequency state updates.You may have noticed that this still leaves concern #3: the conceptual gap. While this isn't something we can solve with a framework, I've been spending ~40% of my time working on docs, content, and examples to help resolve this. ActorCore is also turning out to be community-driven as hoped, which enables more people to try and share their experience with stateful serverless.We'd love it if you'd give ActorCore a try, read the roadmap, and/or let us know where we can improve anything. If you're hesitant about trying stateful serverless, I'd love to learn more in the comments. Looking forward to feedback!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Tiny Brain Sensor Fits Between Strands of Hair</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/eeg-electrode</link><author>Greg Uyeno</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTg4NjM2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjgxODk5N30.4Nwzkq6IH64BCuz4GDLxiFZctusFNRyV5Brqb3sQ-tM/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:39:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The small electrode, attached by microneedles, improves data quality]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why El Salvador President Bukele Is So Popular With Trump’s Inner Circle | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAPzdvOIg4</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vZAPzdvOIg4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:01:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele is one of the biggest right-wing icons in the world.

Agents, memory, RAG, assistants—so many buzzwords! But the reality is, you don’t need fancy techniques or libraries to build useful personal tools with LLMs.In this short post, I’ll show you how I built a useful AI assistant for my family using a dead simple architecture: a single SQLite table of memories, and a handful of cron jobs for ingesting memories and sending updates, all hosted on Val.town. The whole thing is so simple that you can easily copy and extend it yourself.The assistant is called Stevens, named after the butler in the great Ishiguro novel Remains of the Day. Every morning it sends a brief to me and my wife via Telegram, including our calendar schedules for the day, a preview of the weather forecast, any postal mail or packages we’re expected to receive, and any reminders we’ve asked it to keep track of. All written up nice and formally, just like you’d expect from a proper butler.Here’s an example. (I’ll use fake data throughout this post, beacuse our actual updates contain private information.)Beyond the daily brief, we can communicate with Stevens on-demand—we can forward an email with some important info, or just leave a reminder or ask a question via Telegram chat.That’s Stevens. It’s rudimentary, but already more useful to me than Siri!Let’s break down the simple architecture behind Stevens. The whole thing is hosted on Val.town, a lovely platform that offers SQLite storage, HTTP request handling, scheduled cron jobs, and inbound/outbound email: a perfect set of capabilities for this project.First, how does Stevens know what goes in the morning brief? The key is the butler’s notebook, a log of everything that Stevens knows. There’s an admin view where we can see the notebook contents—let’s peek and see what’s in there:You can see some of the entries that fed into the morning brief above—for example, the parent-teacher conference has a log entry.In addition to some text, entries can have a  when they are expected to be relevant.  There are also entries with no date that serve as general background info, and are always included. You can see these particular background memories came from a Telegram chat, because Stevens does an intake interview via Telegram when you first get started:With this notebook in hand, sending the morning brief is easy: just run a cron job which makes a call to the Claude API to write the update, and then sends the text to a Telegram thread. As context for the model, we include any log entries dated for the coming week, as well as the undated background entries.Under the hood, the “notebook” is just a single SQLite table with a few columns. Here’s a more boring view of things:But wait: how did the various log entries get there in the first place? In the admin view, we can watch Stevens buzzing around entering things into the log from various sources:This is just some data importers populating the table:An hourly data pull from the Google Calendar APIAn hourly check of the local weather forecast using a weather APIInbound Telegram and email messages can also result in log entriesEvery week, some “fun facts” get added into the log, as a way of adding some color to future daily updates.This system is easily extensible with new importers. An importer is just any process that adds/edits memories in the log. The memory contents can be any arbitrary text, since they’ll just be fed back into an LLM later anyways.A few quick reflections on this project:It’s very useful for personal AI tools to have access to broader context from other information sources. Awareness of things like my calendar and the weather forecast turns a dumb chatbot into a useful assistant. ChatGPT recently added memory of past conversations, but there’s lots of information not stored within that silo. I’ve written before about how the endgame for AI-driven personal software isn’t more app silos, it’s small tools operating on a shared pool of context about our lives.“Memory” can start simple. In this case, the use cases of the assistant are limited, and its information is inherently time-bounded, so it’s fairly easy to query for the relevant context to give to the LLM. It also helps that some modern models have long context windows. As the available information grows in size, RAG and fancierapproaches to memory may be needed, but you can start simple.Vibe coding enables sillier projects. Initially, Stevens spoke with a dry tone, like you might expect from a generic Apple or Google product. But it turned out it was just more  to have the assistant speak like a formal butler. This was trivial to do, just a couple lines in a prompt. Similarly, I decided to make the admin dashboard views feel like a video game, because why not? I generated the image assets in ChatGPT, and vibe coded the whole UI in Cursor + Claude 3.7 Sonnet; it took a tiny bit of extra effort in exchange for a lot more fun.Stevens isn’t a product you can run out of the box, it’s just a personal project I made for myself.But if you’re curious, you can check out the code and fork the project here. You should be able to apply this basic pattern—a single memories table and an extensible constellation of cron jobs—to do lots of other useful things.I recommend editing the code using your AI editor of choice with the Val Town CLI to sync to local filesystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Major Breakthrough in ‘A Minor’ Waltz Investigation 🔎 #Chopin #Waltz #Piano</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2JqxgvVlCA</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/i2JqxgvVlCA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:25:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jeffrey Kallberg breaks down the new evidence pointing to Chopin as author of the recently discovered A Minor Waltz.

Wanted to have a single include lib that would allow us to write something like:```
PROFILE("Loop 1")
for (...) // some work
```and have the next expression automatically record time & dump results to a table. Wrote a few macros to do exactly that a few months back, but they were primitive and basically unusable for recursive code.Tried to come up with a more generic solution that would build a call graph for nested profiler-macros, handle threads and etc. but doing so in a naive way would be super slow since we'd need some kind of a recursive map of nodes with callsites as a keys.Recently had a revelation that it is possible to use macro-generated thread_local's to associate callsites with integer IDs on the fly and with some effort call graph can be neatly encoded in a few contiguous arrays with all graph building & traversal logic reduced to simple checks and array lookups. Realized threading can be quite easily supported too in an almost lock-free fashion.After a few days of effort ended up building what I believe is a very much usable single-header profiling lib. Couldn't find anything quite like it, so I'd like to present it here and hear some opinions on the product:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>@that_rendle about what&apos;s wrong with enterprises (#SAFe)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prN_9PfyixM</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/prN_9PfyixM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:01:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #ProgrammingMistakes #Programming #SoftwareEngineering #WorstMistakes #Rendle #MarkRendle #Linebreakers #Deloitte #AutoScrum #Accenture #ScaledAgile #Scrum #Viral #ViralShorts #ViralProgrammingShorts #GOTO

What exactly is the basis for democracy?

Arguably liberalism, the belief that the government serves the people, is the stone on which modern democracy was founded. That notion is so ingrained in the US that we often forget that America could be governed any other way.

But political philosopher John Gray believes that liberalism has been waning for a long, long time.

He joins Sean to discuss the great liberal thinker Thomas Hobbes and America's decades-long transition away from liberalism.

Well, it has these layers of transparent metal electrodes embedded in the display. When your finger gets close to the screen it causes a disturbance in the magnetic field that the electrodes sense.Because the electrodes are laid out on a grid, they can report back the x and y co-ordinates of the disturbance to the operating system. Pretty neat.Or maybe you’ve wondered why we call it a Gaussian blur? When we blur an image, we look at all the neighbouring pixels and multiply them by a matrix of weights called a kernel.The most common type of kernel has a gaussian distribution, meaning it gets stronger towards the middle and weaker at the edges. This produces a more realistic blur without being too computationally expensive.Maybe you’ve always wanted to know how the pen tool works in Figma and what those handles actually do when you move them.They control the points on a bezier curve which is a cool piece of math we use to draw curves in vector graphics, like fonts and SVGs.But of course, our screens are made of pixels and struggle to display smooth curves. So we have to take these curves and figure out how to display them so that they represent the shapes as accurately as possible.This is called rasterisation but it’s not as simple as it seems and we need a whole bunch of clever tricks like, anti-aliasing to trick our eyes into thinking we are looking at straight lines.If you’ve ever wondered about any of these things or if they’ve sparked your curiosity, then this is for you.This book won’t teach you how to actually make software - it’s not a tutorial or a guide but rather something more interesting than that. It’s a manual that explains how the things you use everyday actually work.It won’t make you a better designer or programmer tomorrow - there’s nothing actionable in here. But knowing how things work comes in handy when you find yourself out of your depth. Or at the very least, you can pretend to be smart in front of your friends.You don’t need to be technical to read this - there are a lot of pictures and diagrams to do the heavy lifting. You just need to be curious.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Resurrecting Infocom&apos;s Unix Z-Machine with Cosmopolitan</title><link>https://christopherdrum.github.io/posts/2025/04/porting-infocom-with-cosmo</link><author>ChristopherDrum</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 03:51:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently brought Infocom's original UNIX z-machine source code back to life on modern systems.

Here is one representative review from the Apple App Store:My main issue with the app is that it lacks a home screen widget I could use to quickly check my car’s battery status, unlike apps for other electric car brands like Rivian, Ford, and Lucid.Meanwhile, others have developed their own Nissan LEAF apps with a custom user interface and additional features (some with a home screen widget!):Unfortunately, I understand that none of these apps are still available to use where I live in North America. 😞The developer of “My Leaf” shared his frustration in a blog post, explaining how Nissan’s deliberate changes to their North American API forced him to discontinue support for users in the region:I simply won’t support it any longer because of Nissan of North America’s persistant work on blocking third party clients. I continued to try and support the API during the last 12 months. Playing cat and mouse with Nissan. I simply don’t have the time and honestly the drive to continue when I know Nissan are consistently trying to break third party clients on purpose. It’s a sad and foolishness reality indeed.Nevertheless, I decided to take on the challenge of developing an iPhone home screen widget that could show me the battery charge status of my Nissan LEAF car.I added one more constraint to the project: no spending money. I believe Nissan’s app should already provide a home screen widget, so it didn’t seem fair to have to spend any money on this project. However, using tools/devices I already had access to was fair game.Notably, that ruled out using something like Sidecar which appears to provide a home screen widget. I think it looks very slick, but it requires the purchase of a wireless On-board Diagnostics (OBD) scanner plus a $6.99 USD/month subscription. 😓It also ruled out using the popular LeafSpyPro app which similarly requires the purchase of a wireless OBD scanner and costs $19.99 USD. To my knowledge, it doesn’t provide a home screen widget itself, but I think you could probably develop one using its data syncing feature.I am happy to report I was successful and spent no money! Here is a screenshot of the widget:And if you tap the widget, it opens the NissanConnect app. You’ll notice in the following video that there are a few extra non-ideal screen transitions (more on that below), but hey, you get what you pay for!To reduce the risk of any API-breaking changes, I’m just using the official NissanConnect app without any modifications:The  field contains a TinyURL that redirects to shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=OpenNissanConnect which uses the Shortcuts URL scheme to run the Apple Shortcut from (3). I did this because IFTTT seems to check that the  you provide actually resolves to a valid web URL; otherwise, the IFTTT website just opens and displays an error when you tap on the widget.The NissanConnect app developers could definitely make changes that would break how this widget works, but those changes would by definition probably negatively affect regular human users too which I hope they would want to avoid.My original plan was to run an Android emulator on the GitHub Actions runner in the cloud so I wouldn’t need to maintain my own Android device, and that  works (in fact, it does work on my M3 Apple Silicon macOS laptop using an  Android emulator), but it seems like the NissanConnect app (or maybe the server it connects to) may detect when  Android is being used and then refuse to sign in. Or at least, I always saw the following error when I tried both in the cloud and on an old  laptop I had:And unfortunately, at the time of writing, I understand:…or I might trade in my Nissan LEAF and get a different electric car with a better app experience before that happens. 😅]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Everyone Fears the F-15 Eagle</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDVO7wuMoO4</link><author>Mustard</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EDVO7wuMoO4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 02:06:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ZBQ-F-yktYD4m5AzM6pww">Mustard</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Engineered from the ground up for tactical dominance in any air space, the F-15 Eagle holds the distinction of over a hundred aerial victories without a single defeat, making it the the most successful fighter jet in history.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Sinking of the Titanic</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-sinking-of-the-titanic</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67f9448710b3098e4a6297a7/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=mzy3hjIlAbg91TNd1xXTXnJ-Ef-EkN3bMLePuAywu1g" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The rise &amp; fall of Bud Light</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntdffod9hCg</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ntdffod9hCg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 22:04:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tesla Vandals &amp; Boycott Leaders: 5CAST with Andrew Callaghan (#2) w/ Joel Lava &amp; Anti-car Activist</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ALScndNfcM</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8ALScndNfcM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 19:36:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you're ever injured in an accident, you can check out Morgan & Morgan.

It's a very important feature and it's one of the very few remaining things which wasn't supported by Linux Mint Debian Edition." 

Slashdot reader BrianFagioli speculates that "this could be a sign of something much bigger."
OEM installs are typically reserved for operating systems meant to ship on hardware. It's how companies preload Linux on laptops without setting a username, password, or timezone... Mint has supported this for years — but only in its Ubuntu-based version. So why is this feature suddenly coming to Linux Mint Debian Edition, which the team has repeatedly described as a contingency? In other words, if the Debian variant is merely a plan B, why make it ready for OEMs? 

Their blog post goes on to speculate about possible explanations (like the hypothetical possibility of dissatisfaction with Snap packages or Canonical's decisions around telemetry and packaging). 

Slashdot reached out to Linux Mint project leader Clement Lefebvre, who responded cheerfully that "I know people love to speculate on this. There's no hidden agenda on our side though. 

"Improving LMDE is a continuous effort. It's something we do regularly."

"Any LMDE improvement facilitates a future potential transition to Debian, of course. But there are other reasons to implement OEM support. 

"We depend on Ubiquity in Linux Mint. We have a much simpler installer, with no dependencies, no technical debt and with a design we're in control of in LMDE. Porting LMDE's live-installer to Linux Mint is something we're looking into. Implementing OEM support in live-installer kills two birds with one stone. It improves LMDE and opens the door to switching away from Ubiquity in Linux Mint."

Vivien worked as an escort and dominatrix for four years. Christina was forced into sex work by her drug-addicted mother.

The change in the law regarding sex work presupposes that people offer sexual services voluntarily and that they are of legal age. However, the reality is often different.

Vivien and Christina talk about their lives as sex workers and how they got out. Vivien is now a social worker, supporting young girls. She was raised in a single-parent household and money was extremely tight. She also longed for male recognition. She was often sexually exploited and was even raped once. She ceased sex work in 2022 and is now involved with Sisters e. V., an organization that supports sex workers. 

A shelter for women was Christina's salvation. She was forced to offer her body in brothels, brothels, and, often, on the streets. In the process, she experienced a lot of violence. Christina was able to escape in a cloak-and-dagger operation. But she had trouble adjusting, and her inner demons rose up inside her. She went back into the milieu - into a life she knew. After a year, she left for a second time - this time successfully. Today she lives with her young daughter in a shelter.

Since the new sex work law passed, there have been fewer investigations into human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. But many women are afraid to testify, says Helmut Sporer, a former senior criminal investigator in the field of sex work and human trafficking.

ORIGINAL TALK TITLE
From Gamepads to Launchpads: What the Tech World Can Learn from Video Game UX

ABSTRACT
Ever wondered why video games are so good at keeping players engaged, informed, and empowered? It’s not magic—it’s deep mastery of user experience.

In this talk, I’ll reveal how the same principles that game developers use to guide players through complex game worlds can be applied to other fields. In this talk, Theo will use game design examples from her work on games for NASA and Space X's Polaris Dawn and Artemis missions to illustrate how game developers weave these experiences with concrete techniques and principles. By applying these techniques, other tech fields can elevate their user interactions to be just as intuitive, engaging, and effective.

Get ready for a journey from gamepads to launchpads that might just change how you see UX and your relationship with your users. [...]

Is It More Famous Than Linux?</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/04/13/0110228/torvalds-celebrates-gits-20th-anniversary-is-it-more-famous-than-linux?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 03:44:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Celebrating Git's 20th anniversary, GitHub hosted a Q&A with Linus Torvalds, writes Its FOSS News. 

Among the other revelations: He says his college-age daughter sent a texting saying he's better known at her CS lab for Git than for Linux, "because they actually use Git for everything there." Which he describes as "ridiculous" because he maintained it for just four months before handing it off to Junio Hamano who's been heading up development for more than 19 years now. "When it did what I needed," Torvalds says, "I lost interest."


 Linus then goes on to share how Git was never a big thing for him, but a means to an end that prevented the Linux kernel from descending into chaos over the absence of a version control system. You see, before Git, Linux used BitKeeper for version control, but its proprietary licensing didn't sit too well with other Linux contributors, and Linus Torvalds had to look for alternatives. As it turned out, existing tools like CVS and Subversion were too slow for the job at hand, prompting him to build a new tool from scratch, with the coding part just taking 10 days for an early self-hostable version of Git. 
In its initial days, there were some teething issues, where users would complain about Git to Linus, even finding it too difficult to use, but things got calmer as the tool developed further. 

Torvalds thinks some early adopters had trouble because they were coming from a background that was more like CVS. "The Git mindset, I came at it from a file system person's standpoint, where I had this disdain and almost hatred of most source control management projects, so I was not at all interested in maintaining the status quo."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Did Europe Rebuild After The Second World War?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG4KOzwbjX4</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dG4KOzwbjX4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 21:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the tumultuous years immediately following World War 2 in Europe.

Note that the example code is written in JSX (or React), not ordinary HTML.Make the line, using  or .Most of these similar things are using the same technique.
Mask out an animated block, putting some animations and probably designed some parts in Figma or other SVG editors.Unkey's landing page is a nice example.I made a clerk-like style Table Of Contents (TOC) on Fumadocs, you can try it out and play with the nice TOC.To implement it, we have to render the TOC outline on server, without client-side JavaScript to make it compatible with SSR.Since we're on server, we don't know the exact positions of elements.
My approach is to use  positions, render the outline as different "components", and snitch them together.This isn't hard, but we also want to render a highlighted part of outline where the items are active, or their corresponding heading is visible in the viewport.I'll call it the . It has to be animated, so we can't just change the color of these outline components.We cannot animate the thumb with simple CSS solutions, lucky we have the exact rendered positions of TOC items, since the thumb is meant to be interactive, it is Using the information from our browser, we can construct a "mask map" on client, look like this:The method to construct this map is  - yes, our old friend.The  property of SVG  isn't a nonsense auto-generated string, it's a list of commands.
See the Web Docs for more details, it's quite a powerful tool.With our new tool, we can tell SVG to render a line connecting each point of the outline.This constructed a SVG that's  to our original TOC outline pre-rendered on server.Similar to the technique we've learnt from Animated Wires, we can use the CSS  property to mask an animated  block to render the thumb - a highlighted part of outline.Check the source code to see my implementation in React.js.Huge thanks to Clerk for inspiring me on this, I've never thought the TOC of a documentation site can be that interesting to play with.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Andrew hasn’t been on Joe Rogan</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTGH2zbLi4Y</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JTGH2zbLi4Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 16:44:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Air pollution fell substantially as Paris restricted car traffic</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2025/04/12/air-pollution-paris-health-cars/</link><author>perihelions</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 16:26:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Los Angeles Mountain Lions Inspire the World&apos;s Largest Wildlife Crossing Bridge | Future of Nature</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHkOmKfetlc</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zHkOmKfetlc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 16:01:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/4hsaG5n

Many legends surround the most famous buccaneers. But who were these men? Simple sailors or brutal thieves? How did they live? This film journeys back in time for answers.

The period between 1690 and 1730 is considered the golden age of piracy. Pirates continue to occupy a special place in the legends of sea adventure: As romantic figures and heroes of stories, pirates still enjoy a positive image today. 

But does this image -- shaped by Hollywood and fiction -- correspond to reality? So far, only a few wrecks of pirate ships have been located and little is known about the everyday lives of the crews. On Mauritius, and in the bay of the Sainte Marie Island off Madagascar, two research missions are seeking concrete answers to these questions. 

Archaeologists are exploring the remains of the "Speaker”, the ship that belonged to the famous pirate John Bowen, who died 1704. The scientists are also researching traces of his crew's stays ashore. Until now, the history of piracy was thought to be largely localized in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean; only a few historians suspected the existence of pirates off the coasts of Madagascar. 

Over the course of his research in the National Library of France, archaeologist Jean Soulat from the LandArc laboratory in Paris discovered documents that led his ideas in new directions -- and turned his previous ideas about piracy on their heads. He decided to put together an international research team of archaeologists and historians to conduct further study. For the first time, numerous aspects of pirates‘ daily lives - on land, and on the water -- are being recreated.

Do they have feelings? Neil deGrasse Tyson, Gary O’Reilly, and Harrison Greenbaum explore the intelligence of plants with astrobotanist Simon Gilroy. From venus flytraps to space farming, we dig deep into the secret world of plants.

We start by looking at plant awareness—do plants know they’re being eaten? Can they predict where the sun is going to be in the morning? How do plants communicate internally without a central nervous system or a brain? Simon explains how plants communicate through chemistry, using glutamate signals, and how psychoactive molecules help defend the plant from predators. 

We explore one of nature’s weirdest plants: the Venus flytrap. Can it count? How does it actually move? And can plants form memories? We explore how plants “learn” from past experiences as well as the dark side to the smell of freshly mowed grass. If a plant survives a harsh winter, how does it know when it’s safe to grow again? Plus, we ask: do plants know when they're in space? 

How do plants react in microgravity? Can they tell which way is up without gravity to guide them? What happens when you try to grow plants in lunar soil—can they survive without the nutrients they depend on here on Earth? And if Martian soil is toxic, could astronauts really fertilize their crops using composted waste? How close are we to turning science fiction into reality?
Finally, could we engineer tastier space food? Would tomatoes grown in orbit taste the same as those on Earth? What about spicy peppers—does space change their flavor? We discuss what foods should be targeted for space farming and what farming on another planet would look like. What if the light around another star is in a different spectrum? Join us as we explore the fascinating frontier of astrobotany and the hidden intelligence of the plants around us!

Over 40 million people in the western United States and northern Mexico depend on the Colorado River’s water. But the water supply has been pushed to its limit and most of it flows into agriculture. In addition, to this day, water from the river is distributed in accordance with an agreement that dates back over a century and experts have said that more water was promised then than the system could sustainably give – a problem that has been made worse by climate change. It’s a perfect storm: Outdated laws, urban growth, climate change and agriculture are causing the river to dry up. So, by the time the Colorado River reaches Mexico, which has a share of 10%, there’s not much water left.

ABSTRACT
In this code-driven talk using Kotlin, Spring Boot and htmx, Rod will show just how good the JVM is as a platform for building GenAI applications.

He'll show how to use Spring AI to build a chatbot with personality, covering:
• RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) using a VectorStore
• Why and how to mix different LLMs, including open source LLMs running locally, in the same application
• How the Spring AI "advisor" architecture can be used to create clean, reusable components
• How to add a toxicity guard and other crosscutting functionality
• How and why to exchange structured data with LLMs
• Best practices for building GenAI applications

He'll share his code on GitHub so attendees can continue their own exploration. [...]

The option—known as a call—gave the buyer the right to purchase SPY at $509 per share. That might not sound strange, except that SPY was trading below $500 when they placed the bet. And the option was set to expire the same day.These are known as zero-day expiry options. They’re cheap because they’re risky. If the market doesn’t move in your favor, they expire worthless. If the market does move, they can pay off massively. But you have to be exactly right on both direction and timing.In this case, the timing was perfect. The trade was placed just before 1:01 pm Eastern Time. At 1:30 pm, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he was pausing most of the tariffs he had imposed earlier that month. The market exploded upward. SPY surged well past the 509 mark. Those options that had cost just 85 cents were suddenly worth more than $25.This was not a small-volume trade. About 30,000 contracts changed hands. That’s a $2.5 million position that turned into more than $70 million. And that’s just one strike. Similar trades occurred in SPY 504, 505, 507, and QQQ contracts as well, suggesting that the total take may have been far larger.It wasn’t just the profit. It was the precision. The market moved before the news. The options were bought before the rally. The volume spiked in contracts that almost never see this kind of interest unless something is expected. And the pattern wasn’t visible on previous trading days. This wasn’t a trend. It was a singular event.And it wasn’t just options. At exactly 1:01 pm EST, trading volume in SPY shares themselves spiked. Nearly 2.75 million shares were bought in that single minute. If those shares were sold at the closing price of $533.94, the buyers would have locked in a gain of more than $36 per share—earning over $100 million in profit in sixty seconds.Over the next fifteen minutes, volume remained elevated. If the same rate of trading continued, that window alone could account for more than 41 million shares traded. That means more than $1.5 billion in potential profit—all before the public even knew why the market was moving.If the trades hadn’t worked out, the losses would have been swift and total. Zero-day options don’t forgive bad timing. The entire $2.5 million could have evaporated by the close of trading. Even with SPY shares, any unexpected reversal would have meant millions in losses. That’s what makes this kind of trading so revealing. Institutions hedge. Retail investors chase momentum. But this? This was conviction. Or it was information.I checked comparable moments in market history: emergency rate cuts in 2008, the first quantitative easing program in 2009. These were true market shocks. But in those cases, SPY volume was flat before the announcements. The price didn’t move until after the news hit the wire. No sign of early bets. No one placing $2 million chips on the right number just minutes before the roulette wheel stopped.This time was different. April 9 shows all the hallmarks of pre-positioning—where a trader takes a major position just before a known catalyst. Sometimes it’s just a hunch. Sometimes it’s a coincidence. And sometimes it’s something else entirely.We don’t know who placed the trades. We don’t know what they knew. But we do know this: if they were guessing, they guessed better than almost anyone in modern market history. And if they weren’t guessing, then someone made a fortune off of information the public didn’t yet have.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google is winning on every AI front</title><link>https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/google-is-winning-on-every-ai-front</link><author>vinhnx</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 03:58:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(PSA: Many people are interested in this post, so I removed the paywall)AlphaGoAlphaZeroAlphaZero-Stockfish 8 chess gamesBut that was the last mistake they made. Today, two and a half years after the ChatGPT debacle, Google DeepMind is winning. They are winning so hard right now that they’re screaming, “Please, please, we can’t take it anymore, it’s too much winning!” No, but really—I wonder if the only reason OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Co. ever had the slightest chance to win is because Google fumbled that one time. They don’t anymore.come out on top by the end of 2025xAI had a shotAnyway, to avoid turning this post into an over-stylized narrative—which I do more often than I’d like—I’m keeping it to bullet points. It hits harder that way. You’ll see what I mean when the list just... doesn’t end.Google and DeepMind fans: enjoy the long-overdue rebirth.Is that all? Not really. Let's not forget that Google is a consumer software company as much as an AI company. They build better models than OpenAI and Anthropic, but they do plenty of other things no one else can do.Before you read on, a quick note: I write this newsletter in an attempt to understand AI and offer that understanding to others who may find themselves similarly disoriented (who isn’t these days…)The project continues thanks to a small group of generous readers who support it with ~$2/week (ChatGPT costs twice as much!).

According to the change proposal announced March 31, Fedora has already reached 90% reproducibility through infrastructure changes including "clamping" file modification times and implementing a Rust-based "add-determinism" tool that standardizes metadata. The remaining 10% will require individual package maintainer involvement, treating reproducibility failures as bugs. 

The effort will use a public instance of rebuilderd to independently verify that binary packages can be reproduced from source code. Unlike Debian's bit-by-bit reproducibility definition, Fedora allows differences in package signatures and some metadata while requiring identical payloads. The initiative follows similar efforts by Debian and openSUSE, and comes amid heightened focus on supply-chain security after the recent XZ backdoor incident.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hour by Hour: Inside The Titanic’s Engine Room As It Sank</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0mUH4fH09E</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/i0mUH4fH09E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 21:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The story of the engineers who worked tirelessly to keep the electric power running as the Titanic sank.

It's like none of these good moments ever happened.Like I was never in any of these rooms. Like I wasn't assigned to high priority features or an owner of meaningful work streams.I was supposed to record a Google IO video next week. A talk I was  very excited to give. Gone.

Privacy advocates warned that Recall was ripe for abuse in intimate partner violence settings. They also noted that there was nothing stopping Recall from preserving sensitive disappearing content sent through privacy-protecting messengers such as Signal.Enshittification at a new scaleFollowing months of backlash, Microsoft later suspended Recall. On Thursday, the company said it was reintroducing Recall. It currently is available only to insiders with access to the Windows 11 Build 26100.3902 preview version.

The data show that Meta has complied with 94% of takedown requests issued by Israel since October 7, 2023. Israel is the biggest originator of takedown requests globally by far, and Meta has followed suit—widening the net of posts it automatically removes, and creating what can be called the largest mass censorship operation in modern history.Government requests for takedowns generally focus on posts made by citizens inside that government’s borders, Meta insiders said. What makes Israel’s campaign unique is its success in censoring speech in many countries outside of Israel. What’s more, Israel's censorship project will echo well into the future, insiders said, as the AI program Meta is currently training how to moderate content will base future decisions on the successful takedown of content critical of Israel’s genocide.The data, compiled and provided to Drop Site News by whistleblowers, reveal the internal mechanics of Meta’s “Integrity Organization”—an organization within Meta dedicated to ensuring the safety and authenticity on its platforms. Takedown requests (TDRs) allow individuals, organizations, and government officials to request the removal of content that allegedly violates Meta’s policies. The documents indicate that the vast majority of Israel’s requests—95%—fall under Meta’s “terrorism” or “violence and incitement” categories. And Israel’s requests have overwhelmingly targeted users from Arab and Muslim-majority nations in a massive effort to silence criticism of Israel.Multiple independent sources inside Meta confirmed the authenticity of the information provided by the whistleblowers. The data also show that Meta removed over 90,000 posts to comply with TDRs submitted by the Israeli government in an average of 30 seconds. Meta also significantly expanded automated takedowns since October 7, resulting in an estimated 38.8 million additional posts being “actioned upon” across Facebook and Instagram since late 2023. “Actioned upon” in Facebook terms means that a post was either removed, banned, or suppressed.All of the Israeli government’s TDRs post-October 7th contain the exact same complaint text, according to the leaked information, regardless of the substance of the underlying content being challenged. Sources said that not a single Israeli TDR describes the exact nature of the content being reported, even though the requests link to an average of 15 different pieces of content. Instead, the reports simply state, in addition to a description of the October 7th attacks, that:This is an urgent request regarding videos posted on Facebook which contain inciting content. The file attached to this request contains link [sic] to content which violated articles 24(a) and 24(b) of the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Act (2016), which prohibits incitement to terrorism praise for acts of terrorism and identification or support of terror organizations. Moreover, several of the links violate article 2(4) of the Privacy Protection Act (1982), which prohibits publishing images in circumstances that could humiliate the person depicted, as they contain images of the killed, injured, and kidnapped. Additionally, to our understanding, the content in the attached report violates Facebook’s community standards.Meta's content enforcement system processes user-submitted reports through different pathways, depending on who is reporting it. Regular users can report posts via the platform’s built-in reporting function, triggering a review. Reported posts are typically first labeled as violating or non-violating by machine-learning models, though sometimes human moderators review them as well. If the AI assigns a high confidence score indicating a violation, the post is removed automatically. If the confidence score is low, human moderators review the post before deciding whether to take action.Governments and organizations, on the other hand, have privileged channels to trigger content review. Reports submitted through these channels receive higher priority and are almost always reviewed by human moderators rather than AI. Once reviewed by humans, the reviews are fed back into Meta’s AI system to help it better assess similar content in the future. While everyday users can also file TDRs, they are rarely acted upon. Government-submitted TDRs are far more likely to result in content removal.investigating Meta’s moderation of pro-Palestine contentA source within Meta’s Integrity Organization confirmed that internal reviews of their automated moderation found that pro-Palestinian content that did not violate Meta’s policies was frequently removed. In other cases, pro-Palestinian content that should have been simply removed was given a “strike,” which indicates a more serious offense. Should a single account receive too many strikes on content that it publishes, the entire account can be removed from Meta platforms.When concerns about overenforcement against pro-Palestinian content were raised inside the Integrity Organization, the source said, leadership responded by saying that they preferred to overenforce against potentially violating content, rather than underenforce and risk leaving violating content live on Meta platforms.Within Meta, several key leadership positions are filled by figures with personal connections to the Israeli government. The Integrity Organization is run by Guy Rosen, a former Israeli military official who served in the Israeli military’s signals intelligence unit, Unit 8200. Rosen was the founder of Onavo, a web analytics and VPN firm that then-Facebook acquired in October 2013. (Previous reporting has revealed that, prior to acquiring the company, Facebook used data Onavo collected from their VPN users to monitor the performance of competitors—part of the anti-competitive behavior alleged by the Federal Trade Commission under the Biden administration in its suit against Meta.)Rosen’s Integrity Organization works synergistically with Meta’s Policy Organization, according to employees. The Policy Organization sets the rules, and the Integrity Organization enforces them—but the two feed one another, they said. “Policy changes are often driven by data from the integrity org,” explained one Meta employee. As of this year, Joel Kaplan replaced Nick Clegg as the head of the Policy Organization. Kaplan is a former Bush administration official who has worked with Israeli officials in the past on fighting “online incitement.”has reportedly used her roleAccording to internal information reviewed by Drop Site, Cutler has continued to demand the review of content related to Kanafani under Meta’s policy “Glorification, Support or Representation” of individuals or organizations “that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms.” Kanafani, who was killed in a 1972 car bombing orchestrated by the Mossad, served as a spokesperson for the left-wing Palestinian nationalist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP was designated as a terrorist group over a quarter century after he was killed, which, according to Meta’s guidelines and Cutler’s efforts, serves as a basis to flag his content for removal, strikes, and possible suspension.The leaked documents reveal that Israel’s takedown requests have overwhelmingly targeted users from Arab and Muslim-majority nations, with the top 12 countries affected being: Egypt (21.1%), Jordan (16.6%), Palestine (15.6%), Algeria (8.2%), Yemen (7.5%), Tunisia (3.3%), Morocco (2.9%), Saudi Arabia (2.7%), Lebanon (2.6%), Iraq (2.6%), Syria (2%), Turkey (1.5%). In total, users from over 60 countries have reported censorship of content related to Palestine, according to Human Rights Watch—with posts being removed, accounts suspended, and visibility reduced through shadow banning.Notably, only 1.3% of Israel’s takedown requests target Israeli users, making Israel an outlier among governments that typically focus their censorship efforts on their own citizens. For example, 63% of Malaysia’s takedown requests target Malaysian content, and 95% of Brazil’s requests target Brazilian content. Israel, however, has turned its censorship efforts outward, focusing on silencing critics and narratives that challenge its policies, particularly in the context of the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.Despite Meta’s awareness of Israel’s aggressive censorship tactics for at least seven years, according to Meta whistleblowers, the company has failed to curb the abuse. Instead, one said, the company “actively provided the Israeli government with a legal entry-point for carrying out its mass censorship campaign.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Navigating Life with Parkinson&apos;s Disease | Full Documentary | Independent Lens | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tNGuUL1Sx4</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4tNGuUL1Sx4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Official website: https://to.pbs.org/IL_2024 | #IndieLensPBS

ABSTRACT
Programming languages are a halfway house between the metal and the mind, a bridge between the world of circuits and the world of applications, the engineered and the social. Programming languages are the medium through which developers codify systems and fragments.
In each programming language is embedded a philosophy (or many) of how to think about code, how to organise thoughts, how to design. Programming languages also define skillsets, ecosystems, jobs, loyalties and communities.

When we think of software and technology we often think in terms of progress and rapid change. Programming languages, however, typically move at a far slower pace. Mainstream languages are still embracing ideas that are decades old. Constructs that developers welcome as new to their language of choice are often older than the developers themselves. And over all this hangs the question, what of the future?
How will current trends, from FOSS to LLMs, shape programming languages and their use?

In this talk, we will take a tour of the past, present and future of programming languages. [...]

Like Apple creating the iPhone (sure, smartphones existed before—but cars also existed before the Ford Model T).But sometimes, I really want a faster horse.Netflix in 2012 was a super fast horse. It had a simple but massive catalog of movies and shows, solid recommendations, and basic library management. Compared to my limited local media library it was great. You could actively tune your tastes and rate things with a 5-star system.Netflix today is very different. It’s not a library—it’s an .
Instead of reliably showing me what I "have" and recommending what I might like, it shuffles content on each interaction, sometimes changing the cover images of shows in real time, like some black-market charlatan. It has no meaningful catalog, no real categories—just short-lived, auto-generated groups like “Binge-worthy” or “Festive spirit.”Even the “New” section is meaningless. It opens with a “For You” row (huh?), then “Continue Watching”, followed by generic "Popular in “My List” on Netflix randomly shuffles items and changes their covers every few hours. “Continue Watching” may or may not include what I actually watched recently.

DESCRIPTION
Barbara Oakley, renowned author and polymath joins Charles Humble for a deep dive into the brain's modes of operation, exploring the focused and diffuse modes of thinking, which together enhance learning by balancing task-oriented problem-solving with creativity.

They emphasize the importance of mental relaxation and the role of exercise, sleep, and a healthy diet in boosting cognitive function. Key concepts such as deliberate practice, retrieval practice, and the value of psychological safety in team dynamics are explored, offering insights into effective learning and collaboration. The relationship between working memory and long-term memory is examined, highlighting how techniques like the Pomodoro Technique and spaced repetition optimize retention. Additionally, the conversation underscores the potential of AI in education, encouraging its integration despite concerns among educators.

Lastly, the phenomenon of rustiness in skill retention is explained through the dynamics of neural connections, with a hopeful outlook on the future of neuroscience research in understanding conditions like autism and dyslexia.

The results are a sobering reminder that, despite bold pronouncements from companies like OpenAI, AI is still no match for human experts in domains such as coding. 

The study's co-authors tested nine different models as the backbone for a "single prompt-based agent" that had access to a number of debugging tools, including a Python debugger. They tasked this agent with solving a curated set of 300 software debugging tasks from SWE-bench Lite. 

According to the co-authors, even when equipped with stronger and more recent models, their agent rarely completed more than half of the debugging tasks successfully. Claude 3.7 Sonnet had the highest average success rate (48.4%), followed by OpenAI's o1 (30.2%), and o3-mini (22.1%).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Saturn&apos;s Giant Scarred World They Didn&apos;t Teach You About in School | Our Solar System&apos;s Moons: Dione</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lJB8ynBibI</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/4lJB8ynBibI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Venture 1.2 billion kilometers out across the solar system to explore Dione, Saturn's fractured ice world.

From the summer of 1944, Hitler's armies had suffered a series of cataclysmic defeats that had left them shattered and desperately trying to hold on in front of the capital of the Third Reich. But how the Soviets' been able to bring the once mighty German Army to the brink of total defeat, and did the Wehrmacht have one last throw of the dice to save the Nazi regime?In this episode, Dan is joined by Professor Evan Mawdsley, author of Thunder in the East: The Nazi-Soviet War 1941-1945 and former Professor of International History at the University of Glasgow. Evan helps Dan explore the stark differences in the narrative of World War II's final months across Western and Eastern Europe. They also discuss the key events from Operation Bagration in June 1944 to the Soviets' advance on Berlin in 1945 and how these tie in with the advance of the Western Allies. Also, could Stalin's strategic decisions have brought the war to an end sooner, and what did Hitler's last offensive in Hungary reveal about the dictator's priorities?Produced and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers concerned to find AI models misrepresenting their “reasoning” processes</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/robot_fibbing-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 22:37:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Remember when teachers demanded that you "show your work" in school?

This documentary dissects the chilling speed of the Nazi ascent: fueled by economic desperation, masterminded propaganda, and brutal suppression. Witness Hitler's early triumphs, the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the annexation of Austria, the conquest of Europe, and the hubris that led to his catastrophic downfall. From the horrors of the Holocaust to the brutal reality of Blitzkrieg, this is the story of a regime built on delusion and violence, a regime that plunged the world into war and ultimately consumed itself in the flames of its own making.

Hackers exploit human error or technical loopholes to steal data -- or publish it on the darknet, if the ransom demanded is not paid. It’s a practice wiith catastrophic consequences.

It can happen to anyone: Private individuals, companies, administrations, schools and even hospitals are falling victim to attacks by hackers. The media has been reporting on cybercrime for years and the trend is rising. Hackers are more powerful than ever - and always ready to exploit human error or technical vulnerabilities to penetrate the IT systems of companies, administrations or private individuals. Their tools include ransomware, i.e. malware that installs itself on a computer to lock it or encrypt data on it. Once this has been done, the criminals can steal the data. They then threaten to publish it on the darknet if the ransom demanded - in cryptocurrency, of course - is not paid. In the USA alone, the damage caused by cyberattacks in 2023 amounted to 12.5 billion dollars. An amount that, within two years, had more than doubled.

A report published by the European Union for Network and Information Security in late 2022 highlights the particular risks faced by the healthcare sector. In fact, thousands of hospitals worldwide have already been virtually attacked. One hospital in Israel, for example, made a virtue of necessity, filming and publishing its handling of the attack to prevent other hospitals from falling into the same trap.

In the film, victims and their relatives talk about how their lives have been impacted by cyberattacks. Company bankruptcies, loss of pension insurance, even suicide - the consequences can be fatal. In the film, viewers also hear from a hacker, who explains how straightforward it is to deprive people of their data.

Call the Midwife
In Season 14, the midwives enter the 1970s, which brings with it new challenges for Nonnatus House – and to British society. The Seventies start as they mean to go on, with Nonnatus House plunged into disarray when activists staging a bid for independence blockade access to the Isle of Dogs. Amid the poverty and uncertainty of life in a declining Docklands, the midwives must also face cases of manic depression, gonorrhea, spina bifida, abortion – and an apparently immaculate conception.

--

After wreaking havoc across the heavens and being captured in a white-hot prison cell, the Monkey King freed himself once more and was itching for a fight. Desperate, the Jade Emperor called on the supreme power in all the heavens: the Buddha himself. But even in the face of this almighty opponent, Sun Wukong was not cowed. Ji Hao follows the Monkey King's quest to outwit the Buddha.

DESCRIPTION
In this GOTO Book Club interview, Jacqui Read discusses with Barry O'Reilly his books "Residues: Time, Uncertainty, and Change in Software Architecture" and "The Architect's Paradox". He explains how uncertainty defines the architect's role and introduces residuality—a method where architects deliberately stress their conceptual models until they collapse, then optimize the resulting "residues" or leftovers to create more resilient systems.

Unlike traditional software engineering approaches, that try to eliminate uncertainty through rigid requirements, residuality embraces random stressors (even far-fetched scenarios like giant lizards) to uncover architectural fault lines.

O'Reilly argues that this playful yet mathematically sound approach produces more robust architectures than conventional methods, and his second book explores how inherited philosophical thinking often undermines software architecture's effectiveness in complex business contexts.

Clients can retrieve or update values by providing the corresponding key, similar to how a  works.A distributed key-value store takes this concept a step further. Instead of storing all the data on a single machine, it spreads the data across multiple servers (or nodes).This distribution enables the system to , handling large volumes of data and user requests, while maintaining  and .But this also introduces a new set of challenges like:How do we efficiently store and retrieve data?How do we persist data to prevent loss during node crashes?How do we evenly distribute data across multiple nodes?How do we keep the data consistent across nodes?How do we detect and recover from node failures?In this article, we’ll walk through how to design a distributed key-value store from the ground up, one that is capable of handling large-scale workloads with , , and .We’ll begin by identifying the  (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should behave).Then, we’ll start with a  and progressively evolve it into a fully distributed system, one building block at a time. Along the way, we’ll explore key system design concepts such as:Consistency models (strong, eventual, causal)By the end of this post, you’ll have a solid understanding of what it takes to build a production-grade distributed key-value store and the trade-offs involved at each stage of the design.1. Functional RequirementsAt its core, our key-value store must support basic  operations focused on keys: – Insert a new key-value pair or update the value if the key already exists. This is the primary write operation. – Retrieve the value associated with a given key. If the key doesn’t exist, return an appropriate result (e.g. null or error). – Remove the key and its associated value from the store. After deletion, a subsequent GET on that key should indicate that it no longer exists.2. Non-Functional RequirementsTo be usable at scale, our distributed store must meet several critical non-functional goals:The system should scale horizontally to handle massive amounts of data and traffic as demand grows.The store must remain accessible with minimal downtime, even in the face of server failures. There should be no single point of failure.Operations like GET and PUT should return results quickly—ideally within a few milliseconds.The system should support a large number of operations per second and serve many concurrent clients without significant performance degradation.1. Start Simple – A Single Node Key-Value StoreBefore jumping into a fully distributed setup, it’s important to understand the basics. Let’s start with the simplest version of a key-value store: one that runs on a .At this stage, the entire system consists of just one server responsible for handling all client requests.The design is straightforward:The server stores data in memory, using a hash map or dictionary-like structure.It exposes basic operations: – Add a new entry or update an existing one – Retrieve the value for a key – Remove a key and its valueHere’s a basic Java-like pseudocode for the core logic:Map<String, String> store = new HashMap<>();

void put(String key, String value) {
    store.put(key, value);
}

String get(String key) {
    return store.getOrDefault(key, null);
}

void delete(String key) {
    store.remove(key);
}Clients send HTTP requests (or use some lightweight protocol), and the server responds accordingly. PUT /set?key=user1&value=JohnThis setup works perfectly for simple use cases, small-scale prototypes, or local development environments but this architecture breaks down quickly in real-world scenarios:If the server crashes, the data is lost, and the system becomes unavailable.You're constrained by the memory, CPU, and storage of a single machine.The system can’t handle growing traffic or data volume. There’s no way to scale out by adding more machines.One bug, hardware issue, or network failure can bring the entire system down.2. Add Persistence – Don’t Lose Data on RestartOur single-node key-value store works, but only until the server crashes or restarts. Once that happens, everything in memory is wiped out. All the data is gone.To make our store useful in the real world, we need , a way to ensure data survives restarts, crashes, or power failures.Let’s walk through how we can add persistence without complicating the system too much.The most common and reliable approach is to use a . Before making any change to the in-memory data, we append the operation to a file on disk.Every time a  or  is issued, it’s logged to disk before applying it to the in-memory store.If the server crashes, we can  during startup to rebuild the state.It ensures durability without relying entirely on memory.Snapshotting – Speeding Up RecoveryOver time, the log file grows. Replaying thousands (or millions) of operations on startup can be slow.To fix this, we periodically create , a full dump of the current in-memory key-value store to disk.Load the latest snapshot.Replay only the log entries after the snapshot.This reduces startup time while keeping the system durable.By adding persistence, we’ve made our system:: Data won’t vanish after a restart.: We can rebuild state even after a crash.: Still basic, but safer.At this point, we’ve built a durable single-node key-value store. It can survive crashes and restarts. But there’s one major problem we haven’t solved yet:The amount of data exceeds the capacity of a single machine?Traffic spikes and one server can’t keep up?We want to support millions of users?A single server also creates a —any bug, hardware failure, or crash can bring the entire system down.To overcome these limitations, we’ll move toward  by partitioning the data across multiple nodes.3.

The same thing that makes them useful for benign tasks—the breadth of data available to them and their ability to use it to generate content at scale—can often be used in malicious activities just as easily. OpenAI revoked the spammers’ account in February.“You are a helpful assistant”The spam blast is the work of AkiraBot—a framework that automates the sending of messages in large quantities to promote shady search optimization services to small- and medium-size websites. AkiraBot used python-based scripts to rotate the domain names advertised in the messages. It also used OpenAI’s chat API tied to the model gpt-4o-mini to generate unique messages customized to each site it spammed, a technique that likely helped it bypass filters that look for and block identical content sent to large numbers of sites. The messages are delivered through contact forms and live chat widgets embedded into the targeted websites.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After months of user complaints, Anthropic debuts new $200/month AI plan</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/anthropic-launches-200-claude-max-ai-plan-with-20x-higher-usage-limits/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/anthropic_max-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 19:20:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Anthropic introduced a new $100- to $200-per-month subscription tier called Claude Max that offers expanded usage limits for its Claude AI assistant. The new plan arrives after many existing Claude subscribers complained of hitting rate limits frequently."The top request from our most active users has been expanded Claude access," wrote Anthropic in a news release. A brief stroll through user feedback on Reddit seems to confirm that sentiment, showing that many Claude users have been unhappy with Anthropic's usage limits over the past year—even on the Claude Pro plan, which costs $20 a month.One of the downsides of a relatively large context window with Claude (the amount of text it can process at once) has been that long conversations or inclusions of many reference documents (such as code files) fill up usage limits quickly. That's because each time the user adds to the conversation, the entire text of the conversation (including any attached documents) is fed back into the AI model again and re-evaluated. But on the other hand, a large context window allows Claude to process more complex projects within each session.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2302 - Ron White</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNxzn-vRodY</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nNxzn-vRodY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 17:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ron White is a stand-up comic, actor, and author.

Most have a default configuration and many allow the user to adjust that configuration. There are many different types of configuration files. Some use text files while others use databases. Python has a standard library called  that you can use to work with Microsoft Windows INI files.In this tutorial, you will cover the following topics:By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to use INI configuration files programmatically with Python.There are many examples of INI files on the Internet. You can find one over in the Mypy documentation. Mypy is a popular type checker for Python. Here is the  file that they use as an example:# Global options:

[mypy]
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True

# per-module options:

[mypy-mycode.foo.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = True

[ypy-mycode.bar]
warn_return_any = False

[mypy-somelibrary]
ignore_missing_imports = TrueSections are denoted by being placed inside square braces. Then, each section can have zero or more settings. In the next section, you will learn how to create this configuration file programmatically with Python.The documentation for Python’s module is helpful. They tell you how to recreate an example INI file right in the documentation. Of course, their example is not the Mypy example above. Your job is a little bit harder as you need to be able to insert comments into your configuration, which isn’t covered in the documentation. Don’t worry. You’ll learn how to do that now!Open up your Python editor and create a new file called . Then enter the following code:# create_config.py

import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser(allow_no_value=True)

config["mypy"] = {"warn_return_any": "True",
                  "warn_unused_configs": "True",}
config.set("mypy", "\n# Per-module options:")

config["mypy-mycode.foo.*"] = {"disallow_untyped_defs": "True"}
config["ypy-mycode.bar"] = {"warn_return_any": "False"}
config["mypy-somelibrary"] = {"ignore_missing_imports": "True"}

with open("custom_mypy.ini", "w") as config_file:
    config_file.write("# Global options:\n\n")
    config.write(config_file)

The documentation states that  parameter allows for including sections that do not have values. You need to add this to be able to add comments in the middle of a section to be added as well. Otherwise, you will get a .To add entire sections, you use a dictionary-like interface. Each section is denoted by the key, and that section’s values are added by setting that key to another dictionary.Once you finish creating each section and its contents, you can write the configuration file to disk. You open a file for writing, then write the first comment. Next, you use the  method to write the rest of the file.Try running the code above; you should get the same INI file as the one at the beginning of this article.The library makes editing your configuration files mostly painless. You will learn how to change a setting in the config file and add a new section to your pre-existing configuration.Create a new file named  and add the following code to it:# edit_config.py

import configparser

config = configparser.ConfigParser()
config.read("custom_mypy.ini")

# Change an item's value
config.set("mypy-somelibrary", "ignore_missing_imports", "False")

# Add a new section
config["new-random-section"] = {"compressed": "True"}

with open("modified_mypy.ini", "w") as config_file:
    config.write(config_file)
In this case, after create the instance, you call to read the specified configuration file. Then you can set any value you want.Unfortunately, you cannot use dictionary-like syntax to set values. Instead, you must use which takes the following parameters: – The name of the section. – The option you wish to change. – The new value you want to set.Adding a new section works like it did when you created the initial sections in the last code example. You still use dictionary-like syntax where the new section is the key and the value is a dictionary of one or more settings to go in your section.When you run this code, it will create an INI file with the following contents:[mypy]
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True

[mypy-mycode.foo.*]
disallow_untyped_defs = True

[ypy-mycode.bar]
warn_return_any = False

[mypy-somelibrary]
ignore_missing_imports = False

[new-random-section]
compressed = True

Good job! You’ve just learned how to modify an INI file with Python!Now you are ready to learn about reading INI files.You already caught a glimpse of how to read a configuration file in the previous section. The primary method is by calling the ‘s method.Here’s an example using the new INI file you just created:>>> import configparser
>>> config = configparser.ConfigParser()
>>> config.read(r"C:\code\modified_mypy.ini")
['C:\\code\\modified_mypy.ini']
>>> config["mypy"]
<Section: mypy>
>>> config["mypy"]["warn_return_any"]
'True'
>>> config["unknown"]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  Python Shell, prompt 8, line 1
    config["unknown"]
  File "c:\users\Mike\appdata\local\programs\python\python312\lib\configparser.py", line 941, in __getitem__
    raise KeyError(key)
builtins.KeyError: 'unknown'You can access individual values using dictionary syntax. If you happen to try to access a section or an option that does not exist, you will receive a .The  has a second reading method called  that you can use as well. Here is an example:>>> sample_config = """
... [mypy]
... warn_return_any = True
... warn_unused_configs = True
... 
... # Per-module options:
... 
... [mypy-mycode.foo.*]

... """
>>> config = configparser.ConfigParser(allow_no_value=True)
>>> config.read_string(sample_config)
>>> config["mypy"]["warn_return_any"]
'True'You use  to read in a multiline string and then access values inside of it. Pretty neat, eh?You can also grab the section and them use list comprehensions to extract the options from each section:>>> config.sections()
['mypy', 'mypy-mycode.foo.*']
>>> [option for option in config["mypy"]]
['warn_return_any', 'warn_unused_configs']The code above is a handy example for getting at the configuration options quickly and easily.Having a way to configure your application makes it more useful and allows the user more control over how their copy of the application works. In this article, you learned how about the following topics:The configparser library has more features than what is covered here. For example, you can use interpolation to preprocess values or customize the parser process. Check out the documentation for full details on those and other features.In the meantime, have fun and enjoy this neat feature of Python!You might also be interested in these related articles:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Efficient Reliable Database Migration: A Legacy Innovation Story • Dave Thomas • GOTO 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aejmi16BFnE</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aejmi16BFnE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 9 Apr 2025 12:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Chicago 2024. #GOTOcon #GOTOchgo

ABSTRACT
Data migrations often fail due to underestimated complexity. This talk explores a critical, large-scale migration at a major ERP company that demanded high performance, reliability, and aggressive timelines.

We'll describe novel techniques including efficient bulk data transfer, table-driven approaches, functional prototyping, and a unique application of IV&V for robust testing. Learn how algorithms developed in distributed systems research solved real-world problems in legacy system modernization.

Discover strategies to implement reliable migration techniques and meet tight deadlines. This talk offers valuable insights for data engineers, architects, and development leaders facing migrations of any scale. [...]

However, Microsoft is up front about the limitations: "We do not intend for this to fully replicate the actual experience of playing the original  game," the researchers wrote on the project's announcement page.Carmack's comments came after an X user with the handle "Quake Dad" called the new demo "disgusting" and claimed it "spits on the work of every developer everywhere." The critic expressed concern that such technology would eliminate jobs in an industry already facing layoffs, writing: "A fully generative game cuts out the number of jobs necessary for such a project which in turn makes it harder for devs to get jobs."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can you solve this SAT question?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC98ZK6Ivug</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ZC98ZK6Ivug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 16:59:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How an SAT question became a mathematical paradox.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Last Greyhound Racetrack in America</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3FlVNN0-AI</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/u3FlVNN0-AI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 8 Apr 2025 16:52:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you've got a gambling issue or any debt, PDS Debt is offering a free debt analysis.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Harrison Greenbaum explore black hole collisions, quantum tricks, and how gravitational waves can help us uncover the early universe with MIT physicist and LIGO researcher Nergis Mavalvala.

What are gravitational waves, and how do they stretch and squeeze spacetime? We break down Hawking radiation and why gravity itself doesn’t get sucked into a black hole. How did Einstein predict them, and why did it take a century to confirm their existence? Nergis breaks down how LIGO can measure distortions smaller than a proton. How do scientists bypass and manipulate quantum uncertainty to measure gravitational waves? 

We go over Einstein’s general relativity and what cosmic phenomena it predicted. We dive into the violent collisions of black holes—what happens when objects moving at half the speed of light crash together? Learn how LIGO works and how lasers help us to make these minuscule measurements. Could gravitational waves let us see into the universe’s earliest moments before the cosmic microwave background? 

Finally, how does every great scientific discovery build on those that came before? What technological advancements might come from gravitational wave research? And most importantly—why does this all matter for our understanding of the universe?

“WE WANT THE FUNK!,” a syncopated voyage through the history of funk music, spans from gospel, soul, highlife, and early jazz roots, to its rise and impact on new wave and hip-hop, as funk music has been transcendent for creators and listeners alike. Revolutionary moments in the movement are captured in James Brown's dynamism, the extraterrestrial funk of George Clinton's Parliament Funkadelic, transformed girl group Labelle, Fela Kuti's Afrobeat, and other influential musicians of the genre.

--

In the 17th century, Isaac Newton offered the first gravitational explanation of tides. As he correctly identified, tides are choreographed by the motions of celestial objects, and Earth’s tides in particular are mostly driven by the Moon. But the precise nature of this relationship is actually quite nuanced. Elise Cutts explains how the Sun and Moon are responsible for the tides.

The U.S. has one military base on the island called the Pituffik Space Base and began stationing forces here after Denmark was invaded by Germany during WWII. So why did the U.S. exit the territory in the first place and what level of involvement do they have on the island today?

WSJ explains Denmark’s efforts to boost defense here with dog-sleds and drones – and why the U.S. abandoned several military bases there decades ago.

Abstract:
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has primarily been dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which can handle complex tasks and generate detailed responses. However, these models require significant resources, making them difficult to use in resource-constrained educational settings. This proposal explores how Small Language Models (SLMs) — simpler, open-source and more affordable AI systems — can transform education by offering personalized learning and scalable solutions, even in low-resource environments.

Introduction:
SLMs are smaller, simpler versions of AI models that are easier to use and cost less. Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which need powerful computers, SLMs can work on basic devices, making them ideal for schools with limited budgets. They maintain efficiency and accessibility while offering targeted solutions tailored to specific educational needs. By focusing on domain-specific knowledge, local languages, and contextual customization, SLMs address the equity and inclusivity gaps often exacerbated by larger models.

Methodology:
This approach leverages insights from recent implementations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in education. Key methodologies include:
1. Fine-tuning on Localized Data: Customizing SLMs to address specific learner needs and proficiency levels.
2. Using Lightweight AI Frameworks: Deploying open-source, resource-efficient tools for underserved communities and low-resource settings.
3. Integrating SLMs into Systems: Adding SLMs to existing learning platforms to create personalized plans and adjust lessons based on students' progress.
4. Real-World Success Stories: Demonstrating how SLMs enhance teaching through automation, support student progress, and operate efficiently without high-end infrastructure.

Demo Proposal:
We will showcase a live demonstration to highlight how Small Language Models (SLMs) can be effectively deployed in real-world educational settings. The demonstration will feature:
Personalized Learning Assistant:
A fine-tuned open-source Small Language Model(SLM) will be used to create personalized learning plans tailored to students' progress and feedback. The key benefits include:
1. Adaptability to Individual Needs: The system adjusts the complexity of learning materials based on each student’s progress. For slow learners, subjects are presented gradually, with difficulty levels, without overwhelming them. This step-by-step progression builds confidence, enhances engagement, and promotes a deeper understanding of concepts, contributing to their long-term success and mental well-being.
2. Affordability in Resource-Constrained Settings: SLMs are optimized for low-resource hardware, making them a cost-effective solution for schools and communities with limited budgets.
This demo will illustrate how SLMs can empower educators and improve learning outcomes, making quality education accessible to all.

Strengths of SLMs:
Small Language Models offer several key advantages for education:
1. Low Resource Requirements: They run on basic devices like low-cost laptops or mobile phones.
2. Cost-Effective: Affordable for schools with limited budgets or in developing regions.
3. Ease of Updates: Easy to adapt to new curricula or local content.
4. Privacy-Friendly: On-device processing ensures student data security.
5. Personalization: Tailors learning to individual student needs and paces.
6. Support for Local Languages: Adaptable to regional languages and cultural contexts.
7. Energy Efficient: Uses less energy, supporting sustainable AI use.
8. Scalable: Easy to implement across schools and districts.

Limitations of SLMs:
1. Less Powerful: SLMs may struggle with complex tasks like handling multi-disciplinary contexts or generating nuanced responses.
2. Performance Risks: Aggressively scaling down models can lead to degraded accuracy, especially for tasks requiring deep understanding.
3. Requires Careful Design: Achieving balance between simplicity and performance demands thoughtful optimization and regular evaluation.

LLMs have been very useful and we have high potential for LLMs in Enterprises. However, evaluating these models remains a complex challenge and one of the reasons for LLMs not being adopted directly. 
The responsible and ethical AI is going to be the key for Enterprises to adopt the LLMs for their business needs.
Traditional metrics like perplexity or BLEU score often fail to capture the nuanced capabilities of LLMs in real-world applications. 
This talk is about current best practices in benchmarking LLMs, limitations of existing approaches and emerging evaluation techniques.

We’ll explore a range of qualitative and quantitative metrics, 
from task-specific benchmarks (e.g., code generation, summarization) 
to user-centric evaluations (e.g., coherence, creativity, bias detection). 
importance of specialized benchmarks that test LLMs on ethical and explainability grounds

Outcome : The audience will be able to understand how to choose LLMs for the right balance of accuracy, efficiency, and fairness. Additionally understand what has improved in granite 3.0 which makes it better LLM.

With the advent of containers, Kubernetes became the de-facto tool to manage these millions of containers. While IP address is a scarce resource, every last pod in Kubernetes demand its own IP address. From infrastructure design perspective, it presents a challenge. A key aspect of container networking is IP address management, which often gets overlooked. How Kubernetes assigns IP address to pods is determined by the IPAM (IP Address Management) plugin being used. Different IPAM plugins provide different feature sets. This talk throws some light on how some of the open source CNI plugins tackles the challenge of IP exhaustion and approaches IPAM.

But to truly harness its potential, understanding its internal architecture and advanced features is essential.In this blog post, we’ll take a deep dive into PostgreSQL’s core components and capabilities, with insights that will help you optimize performance, scalability, and reliability in your applications.Process-Based Architecture: How PostgreSQL manages connections for stability and isolation.Write Ahead Logging (WAL): Ensuring data durability, crash recovery, and replication.Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC): Allowing concurrent reads and writes without blocking.: From parsing and planning to execution and result delivery.: Choosing the right index for your data.: Managing large tables efficiently with range, list, or hash-based partitioning.: Streaming changes for replication and change data capture.: Extending PostgreSQL’s capabilities with custom features.: Real-time insights for monitoring and optimizing database performance.1. Process-Based ArchitecturePostgreSQL follows a process-per-connection architecture, meaning each client connection is handled by a dedicated operating system process.When the PostgreSQL server (postmaster) starts, it listens for incoming connections on the configured port. For each new client connection, it forks a new backend process to handle that session​. This backend process handles all communication and query execution for that client.Once the session ends (i.e., the client disconnects), the associated process terminates.This architecture differs from  used in some other databases (e.g., MySQL or SQL Server), where a single process spawns threads for multiple connections.Why PostgreSQL Chooses Processes?: Each connection runs in its own process, ensuring that if one session crashes, it doesn’t affect others. This design reduces the risk of memory corruption, race conditions, or resource conflicts between clients.: The process model provides a higher level of stability, as issues in one connection are contained within its process.Since each connection is isolated, PostgreSQL doesn’t need fine-grained locking on every internal data structure (as thread-based systems do). This makes the system easier to maintain, debug, and extend.While robust, this architecture does come with certain trade-offs:: Each backend process maintains its own stack and local memory for query execution. This can consume significant RAM, especially when many idle or parallel connections are open.: Handling thousands of concurrent client connections means creating thousands of OS processes. This can lead to high context-switching costs and pressure on kernel-level resources.To maximize performance while retaining the benefits of PostgreSQL’s architecture:Use a  like PgBouncerPgBouncer sits between clients and PostgreSQL, reusing a small pool of persistent connections.This drastically reduces process overhead while supporting thousands of clients.Tune  parameter in Don't allow too many concurrent processes unless your hardware can handle them.A common pattern: set  to ~200–500, and let PgBouncer manage the rest.In addition to client backends, PostgreSQL runs persistent background processes, also forked by the postmaster at startup. Each has a distinct job and helps with system maintenance and performance:Periodically flushes dirty pages from shared buffers to disk (to bound recovery time)Writes WAL (Write-Ahead Log) changes from memory to diskAutomatically cleans up dead tuples and refreshes statisticsContinuously writes dirty buffers in the background to smooth out I/O spikesHandles streaming WAL to replicas for physical/logical replication2. Write Ahead Logging (WAL)Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) is one of PostgreSQL’s most critical mechanisms for ensuring data durability, consistency, crash recovery, and replication.WAL is a sequential log of all database changes, written  those changes are applied to the actual data files (the heap or index pages). This ensures that, in the event of a crash or power failure, PostgreSQL can  and restore the database to a safe and consistent state.Client executes a write operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DDL).PostgreSQL generates a WAL record describing the change.The WAL record is written to memory (WAL buffer).On commit, the WAL is flushed to disk (fsync)—this makes the transaction durable.The actual data files (heap pages) may be updated later, asynchronously by background processes (like the checkpointer or background writer).In case of a crash, PostgreSQL replays the WAL from the last checkpoint to recover the lost changes.: WAL replay brings the database to a consistent state after a crash. This ensures that no committed data is lost, even after a system failure.: Enables both synchronous and asynchronous replication for disaster recovery and read scaling. A replica essentially replays WAL just like crash recovery, but continuously, to stay in sync with the primary.Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR): By archiving WAL, you can restore a backup and replay WAL to a specific point in time, essentially “time-traveling” the database to a desired state.Managing WAL: Best PracticesIf unmanaged, WAL can consume significant disk space. Here are ways to handle it:archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'cp %p /mnt/wal_archive/%f' to delete old WAL files.Set appropriate (e.g., , ) to balance recovery time vs. runtime I/O. to avoid prematurely removing WAL needed by standby or logical consumers.3. Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)PostgreSQL uses  to handle simultaneous transactions without requiring heavy locking. MVCC is a powerful mechanism that allows reads and writes to occur concurrently by maintaining multiple versions of a row. This ensures that every transaction sees a  of the database as it existed at the time the transaction began—regardless of ongoing changes by other users.Traditional databases often use locks to prevent conflicts between readers and writers. However, this leads to blocking and contention:Writers lock rows to prevent readers from seeing half-written dataReaders may block writers while reading dataPostgreSQL avoids this by using MVCC to isolate transactions without locking—resulting in high concurrency, better performance, and smoother scalability.When a transaction starts, PostgreSQL assigns it a unique .PostgreSQL tracks versions of rows using hidden system columns:: The transaction ID that inserted the row: The transaction ID that deleted (or updated) the rowLet’s say we have a table called :id | balance
---+---------
1  | 1000 → inserted by transaction ID 100 → it hasn’t been deleted/updated yetWhat Happens During Reads?When a transaction reads a row, it sees the version that was current at the start of the transaction:It checks  and  to determine if the row  at the time the transaction started.If another transaction later updates the row, it  with a new , leaving the original intact for other readers.BEGIN;  -- Transaction ID = 200
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1;T1 sees the row with Since  and , the row is visible to T1T1 keeps using this  of the database until it commits, even if the data is updated laterWhat Happens During Writes?Writers create new versions of rows without blocking readers, ensuring high concurrency.PostgreSQL . Instead:: Adds a new row with the current transaction’s XID in : Marks the old row’s  and inserts a new row with a fresh : Only sets ; the row remains until cleanupThis design ensures —older transactions can still see the old versions of rows, even after they're updated. Readers , and writers . Each sees the world as it existed at their transaction start.Transaction 2 (T2) – A concurrent updateBEGIN;  -- Transaction ID = 201
UPDATE accounts SET balance = 1500 WHERE id = 1;Here’s what happens internally:Its  → marking it as deleted by T2Its  and So now there are  of the row:Old version: balance = 1000, xmin = 100, xmax = 201
New version: balance = 1500, xmin = 201, xmax = NULLWhat Each Transaction Sees is still active and keeps using its snapshot from the beginning:It sees the old row: It ignores the new row, because its  (which is after T1 started)The new row it just inserted: Once both transactions are done, PostgreSQL will still keep both row versions until the old one is no longer needed.Cleanup: The Role of VACUUMPostgreSQL stores all row versions in the table (heap) until it's safe to remove them. But old versions don’t disappear automatically.That’s where process comes in:Removes old row versions that are no longer visible to any transactionPrevents  by freezing old transaction IDsPostgreSQL runs  in the background by default, but tuning its frequency is critical in high-write systems.4. Query Execution PipelineWhen you run a query in PostgreSQL—whether it's a simple  or a complex join across multiple tables, it goes through a well-defined five-stage pipeline.Each stage transforms the query from raw SQL into actual database operations that return results or modify data.The Five Stages of Query ExecutionPostgreSQL takes the raw SQL string and checks it for .It then converts the query into a  — a structured, internal representation of what the query is trying to do.Think of this step as preprocessing or query transformation—reshaping the original request before planning.PostgreSQL applies rules and view expansions to the parse tree.For example, if the query targets a , the system rewrites the view reference into its underlying query.The planner generates multiple candidate execution plans for the query.It estimates the  of each plan using table statistics and selects the  one.Cost is measured in terms of CPU, I/O, and memory usage—not time directly, but an abstract "execution cost" unit.PostgreSQL  step by step.Execution is , meaning each node requests rows from its child, processes them, and passes results upward.Once the executor produces result tuples, they are  (for SELECT), or  (for INSERT/UPDATE).Key Features in PostgreSQL’s Execution Engine: For large datasets, queries can be split across multiple CPU cores.: Complex queries can be compiled at runtime for faster execution.Use the  command to analyze query plans and identify performance bottlenecks. For example:EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 123 AND order_date > now() - interval '30 days';Indexes are essential to database performance. PostgreSQL offers a variety of index types to optimize query performance for different data types:B-tree (Default Index Type) Equality and range queries (, , , , ) Numbers, strings, dates—anything with a natural sort orderCREATE INDEX idx_price ON products(price); Simple equality comparisons ( only)Slightly faster than B-tree for some equality lookups, but limited in capabilities.CREATE INDEX idx_hash_email ON users USING HASH(email);GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) Documents or composite values (arrays, JSON, full-text search) when you need to check if a document contains a value or perform membership checks. Indexes every element inside a value (like words in a text field or keys in a JSON)-- For full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_gin_content ON articles USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', content));

-- For JSONB
CREATE INDEX idx_jsonb_data ON items USING GIN(data jsonb_path_ops);

-- For array values
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_gin ON posts USING GIN(tags);GiST (Generalized Search Tree) Complex, non-scalar data types (geospatial, ranges, fuzzy text search) Stores  or intervals and supports overlaps, proximity, containment. Underpins the PostGIS extension, range queries, and more.-- For geospatial data (via PostGIS)
CREATE INDEX idx_location_gist ON places USING GiST(geom);

-- For range types
CREATE INDEX idx_price_range ON items USING GiST(price_range);SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned GiST) Data with natural space partitioning (e.g., tries, quadtrees) Prefix searches, IP subnet matching, k-d trees-- For text prefix matching
CREATE INDEX idx_prefix ON entries USING SPGIST(title); Huge, append-only tables where data is naturally sorted (e.g., time-series)CREATE INDEX idx_log_time_brin ON logs USING BRIN(log_timestamp); allows large tables to be divided into smaller, more manageable pieces based on range, list, or hash criteria. This improves query performance by enabling , where only relevant partitions are scanned.PostgreSQL supports , which means you define partitions using standard SQL with the  clause.To create a partitioned table by date range:-- Create the partitioned parent table
CREATE TABLE measurements (
  city_id    INT NOT NULL,
  logdate    DATE NOT NULL,
  peaktemp   INT,
  unitsales  INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logdate);

-- Create child partitions for each year
CREATE TABLE measurements_2024 PARTITION OF measurements
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');

CREATE TABLE measurements_2025 PARTITION OF measurements
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-12-31');When you insert into , PostgreSQL automatically routes the row to the correct partition based on the  value.Splits data by ranges of values (e.g., dates, numbers).Divides data by discrete values (e.g., region codes {“APAC”, “EMEA”, ...}).Distributes rows evenly using a hash function (when range/list isn’t practical or balanced).Partitioning reduces query times by avoiding full table scans. Ideal for time-series data or datasets that can be logically grouped (e.g., by region or category). is the process of transforming PostgreSQL’s  into  like:INSERT INTO customers (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');

UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 42;

DELETE FROM payments WHERE id = 7;It allows changes from the WAL to be streamed in a logical format, making it useful for replication and Change Data Capture (CDC). How Logical Decoding Works?PostgreSQL WAL contains all changes, but in a binary, low-level formatLogical decoding interprets WAL into high-level row changesThe output is emitted using an , such as: (used for PostgreSQL logical replication) (outputs changes as JSON) (outputs Protocol Buffers) (for debugging/logging)A  is created to:Track how much of the WAL has been consumedPrevent PostgreSQL from deleting WAL segments that are still needed by a consumerChange Data Capture (CDC): Stream inserts/updates/deletes to message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) Sync changes into a data warehouse (like BigQuery or Snowflake) Trigger downstream services on data changes Sync tables across PostgreSQL instances (or even to MongoDB/MySQL with external tools) Logical decoding requires extensions like wal2json for specific output formats, as it’s not built-in by default.One of PostgreSQL’s greatest strengths is its . From its inception, PostgreSQL was designed to be , enabling users to extend its functionality without modifying core source code.This has turned PostgreSQL from a traditional relational database into a true —capable of powering everything from analytics to full-text search, machine learning, and distributed systems.An  in PostgreSQL is a package of additional functionality that can include:SQL objects (functions, types, tables, operators)Procedural language supportNative C code for performanceBackground workers or hooks into the core engineOnce installed, extensions behave like built-in features, seamlessly integrated into the database engine.Extensions can be created by the community or bundled with PostgreSQL. To install one:CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;Extensions live in the  directory and are managed through , , and .: Adds  for hashing, encryption, and password handling: Enables vector , useful for machine learning and AI applications: Turns PostgreSQL into a , supporting geometry, GIS queries, spatial indexing: Enables , allowing you to shard and scale out across multiple nodesThis flexibility makes PostgreSQL adaptable to a wide range of applications, from traditional relational databases to specialized data processing systems.PostgreSQL’s  gathers real-time data on database activity, helping you monitor and optimize performance. There are two main types of statistics PostgreSQL collects:Cumulative Activity Statistics: Used for , , and : Used by the  to optimize execution plansCumulative Statistics System (pg_stat views)These statistics are stored in * and reflect what’s happened since the server started or since stats were last reset.: Shows live queries and their status.Shows table-level read/write/VACUUM stats.Tracks index usage (helps detect unused indexes).: Tracks execution metrics for SQL statements, helping identify slow or resource-intensive queries.Example: Identify Top Slow QueriesSELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 5;Planner Statistics (ANALYZE statistics)This refers to the data collected by the  command (automatically run by autovacuum or manually by DBAs) about the contents of tables.These stats are stored in the  system catalog and are critical for query planning.What PostgreSQL collects per column:List of most common values (MCVs) and their frequenciesA  of value distributionWith  (using ), PostgreSQL can also store: between columns (e.g., if ) estimates for combinations of columnsPostgreSQL’s query planner uses these stats to:Estimate  (how many rows a WHERE clause will match)Choose between , , , or Allocate memory for  or If  finds that  occurs in 90% of rows, the planner may avoid using an index because the query isn’t selective.PostgreSQL’s robust architecture and feature set make it a powerful choice for developers. From its process-based model and MVCC for concurrency to advanced features like logical decoding and extensions, it offers the flexibility and reliability needed for modern applications.To take your understanding further, explore:By mastering these concepts, you’ll be well-equipped to design, optimize, and troubleshoot PostgreSQL databases, ensuring your applications run efficiently and reliably.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The application is released on an internal GitHub page with compressed files and an executable. I needed a way to check the latest release artifacts in GitHub and download them.Let’s find out how all this works!You will need to download and install a couple of packages to make this all work. Specifically, you will need the following:You can install both of these using pip. Open up your terminal and run the following command:python -m pip install PyGithub requestsOnce this finishes, you should have everything you need to get the latest GitHub release assets.Downloading the Latest Release AssetsThe only other item you will need to make this work is a GitHub personal access token. You will need to create one of those. Depending on your use case, you may want to create what amounts to a bot account to make your token last a little longer.The next step is to write some code. Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file. Then add the following code to it:import requests

from github import Auth
from github import Github
from pathlib import Path

token =  "YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"

headers = CaseInsensitiveDict()
headers["Authorization"] = f"token {token}"
headers["Accept"] = "application/octet-stream"
session = requests.Session()

auth = Auth.Token(token)  # Token can be None if the repo is public
g = Github(auth=auth)

# Use this one if you have an internal GitHub instance:
#g = Github(auth=auth, base_url="https://YOUR_COMPANY_URL/api/v3")

repo = g.get_repo("user/repo")  # Replace with the proper user and repo combo
for release in repo.get_releases():
    # Releases are returned with the latest first
    print(release)
    break

for asset in release.get_assets():
    print(asset.name)
    destination = Path(r"C:\Temp") / asset.name
    response = session.get(asset.url, stream=True, headers=headers)
    with open(destination, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(1024*1024):
            f.write(chunk)
    print(f"Downloaded asset to {destination}")
The first half of this code is your imports and boilerplate for creating a GitHub authentication token and a requests Session object. If you work for a company and have an internal GitHub instance, see the commented-out code and use that instead for your GitHub authentication.The next step is to get the GitHub repository and loop over its releases. By default, the iterable will return the items with the latest first and the oldest last. So you break out of the loop on the first release found to get the latest.At this point, you loop over the assets in the release. In my case, I wanted to find an asset that was an executable and download it, but this code downloads all the assets.This is a pretty short example, but it demonstrates one of the many things you can do with the handy PyGitHub package. You should check it out if you need to script other tasks in GitHub.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The AI 2027 scenario (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/139</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/139/changelog-news-139.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel Kokotajlo and the AI Futures Project lays out a potential scenario of superhuman AI’s impact, Liam ERD generates beautiful, interactive ER diagrams from your database, Mozilla takes on Gmail with “Thundermail”, algernon explains why grepping remains terrible & Vitor M. de Sousa Pereira rans on the insanity of being a software engineer.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

The announcement touted Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick as major advancements, with Meta claiming top performance in their categories and an enormous 10 million token context window for Scout. But so far the open-weights models have received an initial mixed-to-negative reception from the AI community, highlighting a familiar tension between AI marketing and user experience."The vibes around llama 4 so far are decidedly mid," independent AI researcher Simon Willison told Ars Technica. Willison often checks the community pulse around open source and open weights AI releases in particular.While Meta positions Llama 4 in competition with closed-model giants like OpenAI and Google, the company continues to use the term "open source" despite licensing restrictions that prevent truly open use. As we have noted in the past with previous Llama releases, "open weights" more accurately describes Meta's approach. Those who sign in and accept the license terms can download the two smaller Llama 4 models from Hugging Face or llama.com.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>As Tariff Shockwaves Continue, U.S. Stocks Near a Bear Market</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6oUj2gFhHc</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/W6oUj2gFhHc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 19:03:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WSJ Heard on the Street columnist Jon Sindreu explains the macroeconomic implications of President Trump’s tariff plan.

You want to understand how it works, so you start looking for a place to begin unfolding it. With each corner of the paper you peel back, you notice an even more intricate structure underneath. So you unfold that too, and find even more fine detail underneath yet again. You start to wonder how many layers it can have, and marvel at the intricacy. You remember at the start, when you already thought it was complex, but you had no idea how elaborate it really was. That is the experience of playing Blue Prince.It can be difficult to describe a game like this, in which so much of the design is about curiosity and discovery. But at its most basic level, Blue Prince is a roguelike puzzle game built around exploring a shapeshifting manor house. The executor of the Mount Holly estate has left it to you, but it will only become yours if you reach the mysterious Room 46. You cannot spend the night inside the house, so you set up camp just outside the grounds. After each day, the rooms reset and all of the doors close again. The exact layout of the manor is never the same twice. It takes place in first-person, making it an unfolding puzzle box that you live inside.You start each day at the entrance, the bottom-center square of a 5x9 grid, faced with three doors. Each time you interact with a door, you're faced with three choices of which room to "draft" on the other side. Some rooms are dead ends, others are straight pathways, others only bend, and so on. You have a limited number of steps, and crossing the threshold into a new room ticks down one of them. From the start, you understand the objective to be that carving a pathway using these interlocking pieces, without expending too many steps, will successfully lead to the top of the 5x9 grid, to the Antechamber where there sits the entrance to Room 46. At this point, Blue Prince feels very much like a prestige board game, complete with a grid and tiles to place.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Shiny to Strategic: The Maturation of AI Across Industries // David Cox // #303</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/From-Shiny-to-Strategic-The-Maturation-of-AI-Across-Industries--David-Cox--303-e316r9c</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100936428/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-3-7%2F397945233-44100-2-5bc754e285f14.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 7 Apr 2025 03:31:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From Shiny to Strategic: The Maturation of AI Across Industries // MLOps Podcast #303 with David Cox, VP of Data Science; Assistant Director of Research at RethinkFirst; Institute of Applied Behavioral Science.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn  Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletterShiny new objects are made available to artificial intelligence(AI) practitioners daily. For many who are not AI practitioners, the release of ChatGPT in 2022 was their first contact with modern AI technology. This led to a flurry of funding and excitement around how AI might improve their bottom line. Two years on, the novelty of AI has worn off for many companies but remains a strategic initiative. This strategic nuance has led to two patterns that suggest a maturation of the AI conversation across industries. First, conversations seem to be pivoting from "Are we doing [the shiny new thing]" to serious analysis of the ROI from things built. This reframe places less emphasis on simply adopting new technologies for the sake of doing so and more emphasis on the optimal stack to maximize return relative to cost. Second, conversations are shifting to emphasize market differentiation. That is, anyone can build products that wrap around LLMs. In competitive markets, creating products and functionality that all your competitors can also build is a poor business strategy (unless having a particular thing is industry standard). Creating a competitive advantage requires companies to think strategically about their unique data assets and what they can build that their competitors cannot. // BioDr. David Cox can formally lay claim to being a bioethicist (master's degree), a board-certified behavior analyst at the doctoral level, a behavioral economist (post-doc training), and a full-stack data scientist (post-doc training).

Thus, anyone utilizing Kubernetes relies on a scheduler.kube-scheduler-simulator is a  for the Kubernetes scheduler, that started as a Google Summer of Code 2021 project developed by me (Kensei Nakada) and later received a lot of contributions.
This tool allows users to closely examine the scheduler’s behavior and decisions.It is useful for casual users who employ scheduling constraints (for example, inter-Pod affinity)
and experts who extend the scheduler with custom plugins.The scheduler often appears as a black box,
composed of many plugins that each contribute to the scheduling decision-making process from their unique perspectives.
Understanding its behavior can be challenging due to the multitude of factors it considers.Even if a Pod appears to be scheduled correctly in a simple test cluster, it might have been scheduled based on different calculations than expected. This discrepancy could lead to unexpected scheduling outcomes when deployed in a large production environment.Also, testing a scheduler is a complex challenge.
There are countless patterns of operations executed within a real cluster, making it unfeasible to anticipate every scenario with a finite number of tests.
More often than not, bugs are discovered only when the scheduler is deployed in an actual cluster.
Actually, many bugs are found by users after shipping the release,
even in the upstream kube-scheduler.Having a development or sandbox environment for testing the scheduler — or, indeed, any Kubernetes controllers — is a common practice.
However, this approach falls short of capturing all the potential scenarios that might arise in a production cluster
because a development cluster is often much smaller with notable differences in workload sizes and scaling dynamics.
It never sees the exact same use or exhibits the same behavior as its production counterpart.The kube-scheduler-simulator aims to solve those problems.
It enables users to test their scheduling constraints, scheduler configurations,
and custom plugins while checking every detailed part of scheduling decisions.
It also allows users to create a simulated cluster environment, where they can test their scheduler
with the same resources as their production cluster without affecting actual workloads.Features of the kube-scheduler-simulatorThe kube-scheduler-simulator’s core feature is its ability to expose the scheduler's internal decisions.
The scheduler operates based on the scheduling framework,
using various plugins at different extension points,
filter nodes (Filter phase), score nodes (Score phase), and ultimately determine the best node for the Pod.The simulator allows users to create Kubernetes resources and observe how each plugin influences the scheduling decisions for Pods.
This visibility helps users understand the scheduler’s workings and define appropriate scheduling constraints.Inside the simulator, a debuggable scheduler runs instead of the vanilla scheduler.
This debuggable scheduler outputs the results of each scheduler plugin at every extension point to the Pod’s annotations like the following manifest shows
and the web front end formats/visualizes the scheduling results based on these annotations.This debuggable scheduler can also run standalone, for example, on any Kubernetes cluster or in integration tests.
This would be useful to custom plugin developers who want to test their plugins or examine their custom scheduler in a real cluster with better debuggability.The simulator as a better dev clusterAs mentioned earlier, with a limited set of tests, it is impossible to predict every possible scenario in a real-world cluster.
Typically, users will test the scheduler in a small, development cluster before deploying it to production, hoping that no issues arise.The simulator’s importing feature
provides a solution by allowing users to simulate deploying a new scheduler version in a production-like environment without impacting their live workloads.By continuously syncing between a production cluster and the simulator, users can safely test a new scheduler version with the same resources their production cluster handles.
Once confident in its performance, they can proceed with the production deployment, reducing the risk of unexpected issues.: Examine if scheduling constraints (for example, PodAffinity, PodTopologySpread) work as intended.: Assess how a cluster would behave with changes to the scheduler configuration.Scheduler plugin developers: Test a custom scheduler plugins or extenders, use the debuggable scheduler in integration tests or development clusters, or use the syncing feature for testing within a production-like environment.The simulator only requires Docker to be installed on a machine; a Kubernetes cluster is not necessary.git clone git@github.com:kubernetes-sigs/kube-scheduler-simulator.git
cd kube-scheduler-simulator
make docker_up
You can then access the simulator's web UI at .The simulator has been maintained by dedicated volunteer engineers, overcoming many challenges to reach its current form.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Saint Petersburg: Putin&apos;s Hometown</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/saint-petersburg-putins-hometown</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67eff266f185b2a87f9e9263/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=jdSQ7w6OObfx_AUx_Arz5R1WvjYiC_ebKctu-So3IdU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 6 Apr 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Founded by Peter the Great, the city of Saint Petersburg was built to rival the majesty of any capital in Europe.

Call the Midwife
In Season 14, the midwives enter the 1970s, which brings with it new challenges for Nonnatus House – and to British society. The Seventies start as they mean to go on, with Nonnatus House plunged into disarray when activists staging a bid for independence blockade access to the Isle of Dogs. Amid the poverty and uncertainty of life in a declining Docklands, the midwives must also face cases of manic depression, gonorrhea, spina bifida, abortion – and an apparently immaculate conception.

Now I&apos;m Cheering for Better Linux Hardware</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/04/06/0037234/forget-snow-sequoia-now-im-cheering-for-better-linux-hardware?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 6 Apr 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It was long-time Slashdot reader uninet who argued "Apple Needs a Snow Sequoia." (That is, Apple needs an upgrade to MacOS Sequoia that's like it's earlier "Snow Leopard" upgrade to "Leopard" OS — an upgrade that's "all about how little it added and how much it took away".) 
"My recent column on Apple's declining software quality hit a nerve..." he writes in a follow-up. "So why do any of us put up with software that grows increasingly buggy?" 

"One word: hardware. And that's where I'd love to see someone help Linux take the next step."

Apple knows how to turn out very good quality pieces of hardware and, for many purposes, stands alone. That's been largely true for the last couple of decades. The half-decade of Apple Silicon has cemented this position. At any price point Apple contends, Macs, iPads and iPhones are either without peers or at the top of the market in build quality and processing power... [I]f only there were hardware that was as good and worked together as well as Apple's, jumping ship to Linux would be awfully attractive at this juncture... 

For Apple aficionados troubled by the state of MacOS, the modern GNOME desktop on Linux beckons as a more faithful implementation of the ideals of MacOS than current MacOS does. GNOME is painstakingly consistent across its different apps and exudes the minimalist philosophy with which Apple's hardware shines... Now is a perfect moment for a modern Linux push to take that wind back. What it needs, though, is to solve its remaining weakness on the hardware side. One of the giants of electronics manufacturing, tired of being stuck between the Microsoft and Apple ecosystems, would only need to decide to commit the resources necessary to solve the hardware puzzle... 

ChromeOS has grown to the extent it does because there is hardware designed for it. Take that and carry it further by making it good hardware utilizing the best Linux software and you'd have something disruptive... Initially, the hardware could be "good enough" for the software, much as Apple's software today is merely "good enough" for the hardware. Iterating from there could lead to a genuine third way of computing. 

They titled their piece, "I Want a Better Mac, so I'm Cheering for a Better Linux." (Wondering if Dell or Sony could be the one to supply that good hardware...) "I say this not as someone who thinks Linux will ever dominate the personal computing world, but as someone who wants to see a spark of creativity and push beyond mediocrity in it again. 
"Apple needs a real competitor, one alternatives such as GNOME on Linux could actually be, if only the hardware rose to the occasion."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Zizian Cult &amp; Spirit of Mac Dre: 5CAST with Andrew Callaghan (#1) Feat.

- Landlock is a Linux Security Module (LSM) that lets unprivileged processes restrict themselves. 

- It's been in the kernel since 5.13, but the API is awkward to use directly. 

- It always annoyed the hell out of me to run random binaries from the internet without any real control over what they can access. 

So they've rolled their own solution, according to Thursday's submission to Slashdot:


I just released Landrun, a Go-based CLI tool that wraps Linux Landlock (5.13+) to sandbox any process without root, containers, or seccomp. Think firejail, but minimal and kernel-native. Supports fine-grained file access (ro/rw/exec) and TCP port restrictions (6.7+). No daemons, no YAML, just flags.

Example (where --rox allows read-only access with execution to specified path):

 # landrun --rox /usr touch /tmp/filetouch: cannot touch '/tmp/file': Permission denied# landrun --rox /usr --rw /tmp touch /tmp/file# 

It's MIT-licensed, easy to audit, and now supports systemd services.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1608 - 1813: The Complex History Of Canada&apos;s Indigenous Nations And More</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8s6U9NuUJE</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n8s6U9NuUJE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 5 Apr 2025 21:00:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hundreds of Indigenous nations with advanced cultures already live in Canada when French and English colonizers arrive and fight for land claims.

(That is, "self-managed teams with their own exclusive branded web addresses" to make their massive Python Package Index repository "easier to use for large community projects, organizations, or companies who manage multiple sub-teams and multiple packages.") 
Nearly two years later, they've announced that they're "making progress" on its rollout...
Over the last month, we have taken some more baby steps to onboard new Organizations, welcoming 61 new Community Organizations and our first 18 Company Organizations. We're still working to improve the review and approval process and hope to improve our processing speed over time. To date, we have 3,562 Community and 6,424 Company Organization requests to process in our backlog. 
They've also onboarded a PyPI Support Specialist to provide "critical bandwidth to review the backlog of requests" and "free up staff engineering time to develop features to assist in that review." (And "we were finally able to finalize our Terms of Service document for PyPI," build the tooling necessary to notify users, and initiate the Terms of Service rollout. [Since launching 20 years ago PyPi's terms of service have only been updated twice.] 

In other news the security developer-in-residence at the Python Software Foundation has been continuing work on a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) as described in Python Enhancement Proposal #770. The feature "would designate a specific directory inside of Python package metadata (".dist-info/sboms") as a directory where build backends and other tools can store SBOM documents that describe components within the package beyond the top-level component."

The goal of this project is to make bundled dependencies measurable by software analysis tools like vulnerability scanning, license compliance, and static analysis tools. Bundled dependencies are common for scientific computing and AI packages, but also generally in packages that use multiple programming languages like C, C++, Rust, and JavaScript. The PEP has been moved to Provisional Status, meaning the PEP sponsor is doing a final review before tools can begin implementing the PEP ahead of its final acceptance into changing Python packaging standards. Seth has begun implementing code that tools can use when adopting the PEP, such as a project which abstracts different Linux system package managers functionality to reverse a file path into the providing package metadata. 

Security developer-in-residence Seth Larson will be speaking about this project at PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh, PA in a talk titled "Phantom Dependencies: is your requirements.txt haunted?" 

Meanwhile InfoWorld reports that newly approved Python Enhancement Proposal 751 will also give Python a standard lock file format.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What do snails look like under the microscope?🔬 #Snail #Animals #Nature #Shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRpErF30-JA</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gRpErF30-JA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 5 Apr 2025 15:01:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Best of Earth Science: http://bit.ly/EarthLabOriginals

It would do just about what a contemporary store-bought computer could do. That time is long gone. Modern computers are made of hundreds of huge complex chips with no public datasheets and many hundreds of watts of power supplied to them over complex power delivery topologies. It does not help that modern operating systems require gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of storage, and always-on internet connectivity to properly spy on you. But what if one tried to fit a modern computer into a kit that could be easily assembled at home? What if the kit only had three chips, each with only 8 pins? Can it be done? Yes. The system runs a custom MIPS emulator written in ARMv6 assembly and includes a custom bootloader that supports firmware updates via FAT16-formatted SD cards. Clever pin-sharing hacks allow all components (RAM, SD, serial I/O) to work despite the 6 usable I/O pins. Overclocked to up to 150MHz, the board boots into a full Linux shell in about a minute and performs at ~1.65MHz MIPS-equivalent speed.
 
It's not fast, writes Dmitry, but it's fully functional -- you can edit files, compile code, and even install Debian packages. A kit may be made available if a partner is found.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Trump’s Tariffs Will Transform Global Trade?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpKe_HbVG64</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IpKe_HbVG64?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 23:30:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://surfshark.com/boyle for 4 extra months of Surfshark

What is fast flux anyway?</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/nsa-warns-that-overlooked-botnet-technique-threatens-national-security/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/botnet.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 20:17:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A technique that hostile nation-states and financially motivated ransomware groups are using to hide their operations poses a threat to critical infrastructure and national security, the National Security Agency has warned.The technique is known as fast flux. It allows decentralized networks operated by threat actors to hide their infrastructure and survive takedown attempts that would otherwise succeed. Fast flux works by cycling through a range of IP addresses and domain names that these botnets use to connect to the Internet. In some cases, IPs and domain names change every day or two; in other cases, they change almost hourly. The constant flux complicates the task of isolating the true origin of the infrastructure. It also provides redundancy. By the time defenders block one address or domain, new ones have already been assigned.“This technique poses a significant threat to national security, enabling malicious cyber actors to consistently evade detection,” the NSA, FBI, and their counterparts from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand warned Thursday. “Malicious cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS) records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control (C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Streaming Ecosystem Complexities and Cost Management // Rohit Agrawal // #302</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/Streaming-Ecosystem-Complexities-and-Cost-Management--Rohit-Agrawal--302-e31410r</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/100843995/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-3-4%2F397832723-44100-2-3289384441a76.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 18:42:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Streaming Ecosystem Complexities and Cost Management // MLOps Podcast #302 with Rohit Agrawal, Director of Engineering at Tecton.Join the Community: https://go.mlops.community/YTJoinIn Get the newsletter: https://go.mlops.community/YTNewsletter Demetrios talks with Rohit Agrawal, Director of Engineering at Tecton, about the challenges and future of streaming data in ML.

Despite enduring what felt like month-long panic attacks leading up to this ordeal, I only realized how bad everything had gotten when I woke up in the hospital, body draped in a violently purple hospital gown that I still have no recollection of putting on. I spent a couple days and a thousand or so dollars in that hospital room, an uncomfortable combination of dazed and defeated, mostly. But I also remember feeling absurdly grateful. I was in a space where nothing was expected of me. I had been completely removed from the rest of the living, breathing, working population. It was as if I didn't exist. And it's terrifying to think about how I wanted that back then.Prior to my rejoining society, I was given a choice: I could seek further treatment and attempt to address my various ailments, or I could walk out those doors largely unchanged (apart from being hundreds of dollars poorer). Treatment meant time and money: two things I never felt I had enough of. But as I considered my next steps, the psychiatrist across from me set down her clipboard and told me something I'll never forget."If you don't make time to take care of yourself, your body will make time for you--and you probably won't like when or how it does."Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why It&apos;s So Hard to Exploit Geothermal Energy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZsjAramjb4</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/5ZsjAramjb4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 4 Apr 2025 14:12:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Only a few countries in the world are able to make use of geothermal energy.

If Studio 54 was a church, then its founders, Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, were its high priests, officiating a nightly mass of disco, decadence, and dubious decision-making.

Others wondered precisely how it works under the hood. Here’s a description of what the new service does and doesn’t do, as well as some of the basic security that underpins it.When Google uses the term E2EE in this context, it means that an email is encrypted inside Chrome, Firefox, or just about any other browser the sender chooses. As the message makes its way to its destination, it remains encrypted and can’t be decrypted until it arrives at its final destination, when it’s decrypted in the recipient's browser.Giving S/MIME the heave-hoThe chief selling point of this new service is that it allows government agencies and the businesses that work with them to comply with a raft of security and privacy regulations and at the same time eliminates the massive headaches that have traditionally plagued anyone deploying such regulation-compliant email systems. Up to now, the most common means has been S/MIME, a standard so complex and painful that only the bravest and most well-resourced organizations tend to implement it.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Victory In The Pacific | WW2 In Color Uncensored Episode 13</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPAnWIVvPUY</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iPAnWIVvPUY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 3 Apr 2025 21:12:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Americans wipe out Japan's air force through a strategy of island-hopping.

Planet Earth is the jewel of the solar system—the shimmery blue oceans, the verdant green forests, the wispy whimsical cloud formations. Saturn is the only competitor for most gorgeous planet with that giant ring system. Hmm… what if we could put the jewel of the Earth in its own ring? Then no contest.  Well, there’s an extremely good chance that Earth once DID have a ring system. At least, that’s the proposal by a recent study that has evidence that a mysterious burst in meteor activity nearly half a billion years ago was actually caused by that ancient ring system collapsing onto the Earth. And, you know, if we had a ring once maybe we can have one again.

Oracle staff informed some clients this week that the attacker gained access to usernames, passkeys and encrypted passwords, according to the people, who spoke on condition that they not be identified because they're not authorized to discuss the matter. Oracle also told them that the FBI and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike are investigating the incident, according to the people, who added that the attacker sought an extortion payment from the company.

In this new exclusive documentary, Historian Tristan Hughes re-joins the hunt for the mysterious Ninth Legion.

Joining forces with Historian and Archaeologist Simon Elliot,  Tristan sets off on a road trip to three key Roman sites, a roman marching camp, iron age hill fort and site of a third previously undiscovered Roman camp high up in the Derbyshire Dales. 

Three sites that combined with incredible new artefacts could attest to a long lost ancient battle between Roman forces and Iron Age Briton's.

Developed by Compulsion Games--the team behind Contrast and We Happy Few--South of Midnight builds on the Canadian studio's strengths: intriguing narrative concepts, perturbing atmosphere, and memorable characters. Much like Contrast and We Happy Few, South of Midnight's gameplay pales in comparison to its narrative elements, but Compulsion Games' latest effort is its strongest game by far, delving into a setting and lore rarely seen in major video games to tell an incredible story.In South of Midnight, you play as Hazel, a teenage track star who lives in Prospero, a town in the American Deep South. After a hurricane sweeps her home away with her mother inside, Hazel vows to track down and save her. However, she soon discovers that the storm has not only transformed the rural town and surrounding swampland into a dangerous jungle gym but also knocked loose a lot of lingering dark magic, making this journey all the more perilous. Hazel quickly learns that she is a weaver, a person born with the innate ability to see the underlying strands that tie the world together and can also knot into terrifying monstrosities in places where powerful negative emotions like grief, rage, and fear gather. Armed with surprisingly sharp textile-spinning tools, Hazel's search for her mom sees her stumble across numerous legendary spirits inspired by real-world myths, which she can help by uncovering the trauma that created them and doing her best to capture those feelings in magical bottles so that they can be taken away. To whom or where? That's just another mystery to solve.It's a strong story that dips into Southern Gothic themes and cultivates a sense of dread that you cannot fully dismiss, for each of its tales exists in that unnerving middle ground of clearly being fantastical whilst pulling from real-world terrors like bigotry and child abuse. And when confronted with absurd displays of evil cruelty or agonizing tragedy in these stories, you can't easily discern where exactly reality ends and the myth begins--the pain in these gothic tales cling to you, much as they do to Hazel, and keep South of Midnight emotionally compelling all the way through.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The legend of Beowulf and the revenge of the swamp beast - Iseult Gillespie</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43qXqa8Q8o4</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/43qXqa8Q8o4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 3 Apr 2025 15:01:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Explore the classic poem, “Beowulf,” which follows a heroic prince as he fights to free a kingdom from the monster Grendel.

--

An epic written in Old English, “Beowulf” is known for its haunting monsters, dream-like language, and paranoid perspective, where violent threats are always waiting on the fringes of society. The action follows Beowulf, a prince of Geats, who travels to aid a kingdom in freeing itself from a monster’s reign of terror. Why is this poem considered a classic? Iseult Gillespie traces the hero’s tale.

A service might become unresponsive. A network call might time out. The question is not  these things will happen—but .As engineers, our job is to design systems that embrace this reality and gracefully handle failures.In this article, we’ll cover: in distributed systems for handling failuresDistributed systems involve multiple independent components communicating over a network.And each of these introduces potential failure points:The network is the most unreliable component in any distributed architecture.Even if two services are running in the same data center, network glitches can still occur.A single machine (or container) can go down due to:In distributed systems, every node is potentially a single point of failure unless redundancy is built in.A service may fail even if the machine it's running on is healthy.Code bugs (null pointers, unhandled exceptions)Deadlocks or resource exhaustionMemory leaks causing the service to slow down or crashMisconfigurations (e.g., bad environment variables)Caches (like Redis or Memcached)External APIs (payment gateways, 3rd-party auth providers)Message queues (like Kafka, RabbitMQ)If any of these are unavailable, misbehaving, or inconsistent, it can cause cascading failures across the system. Your checkout service calls the payment API, which calls a bank API, which calls a fraud-detection microservice. Each hop is a potential point of failure.Data replication across systems (like DB sharding, caching layers, or eventual consistency models) can introduce:Lost updates due to race conditions A user updates their address, but due to replication lag, the shipping system fetches the old address and sends the package to the wrong place.6. Configuration & Deployment ErrorsFailures aren't always caused by bugs—they’re often caused by mis-configurations and human errors:Misconfigured load balancersMissing secrets in the environmentIncompatible library updatesDeleting the wrong databaseRolling out a new version without backward compatibilityAccording to multiple incident postmortems (e.g., AWS, Google), a large number of production outages are triggered by —not code.7. Time-Related Issues (Clock Skew, Timeouts)Distributed systems often rely on time for:But system clocks on different machines can drift out of sync (called ), which can wreak havoc.Machine A: 12:00:01
Machine B: 11:59:59A token generated on Machine B might be considered “expired” when validated by Machine A, even if it was just created.Let’s look at the  that make your system resilient when parts of it inevitably fail.1. Set Timeouts for Remote CallsA timeout is the maximum time you’re willing to wait for a response from another service. If a service doesn’t respond in that time window, you abort the operation and handle it as a failure.Every network call whether it’s to a REST API, database, message queue, or third-party service should have a timeout.Waiting too long can hog threads, pile up requests, and cause cascading failures. It’s better to fail fast and try again (smartly).To be effective, timeouts should be:Short enough to fail fastLong enough for the request to realistically completeVary depending on the operation (e.g., reads vs writes, internal vs external calls)A good practice is to base timeouts on the service’s typical latency (e.g., use the 99th percentile response time or service SLO, plus a safety margin)​. If your downstream service has a p99 latency of 450ms:Recommended Timeout = 450ms + 50ms buffer = 500msThis ensures most successful responses arrive before the timeout, while truly slow or hung requests get aborted.Never use infinite or unbounded timeoutsDon’t assume the caller will enforce a timeout for you2.

In this episode we travel along the vast grassland corridor of the steppe, to hear one of the most remarkable and unlikely stories from medieval history – the story of the Mongol Empire. Find out how this group of nomadic horse riders united the peoples of the Mongolian steppe, and forged them into a truly unique kind of state. Discover how they conquered much of the lands of Eurasia, and brought the distant cultures of China, Persia, the Middle East and Europe into contact. And hear the story of how the world’s largest land empire finally came apart, and left the world as we know it in its wake.

On this episode we are joined by the virtuoso of Mongolian throat singing, Batzorig Vaanchig. You can find more of his music on his channel: https://www.youtube.com/@BatzorigVaanchig

Automated bots seeking AI model training data for LLMs have been vacuuming up terabytes of data, growing the foundation's bandwidth used for downloading multimedia content by 50 percent since January 2024. It’s a scenario familiar across the free and open source software (FOSS) community, as we've previously detailed.The Foundation hosts not only Wikipedia but also platforms like Wikimedia Commons, which offers 144 million media files under open licenses. For decades, this content has powered everything from search results to school projects. But since early 2024, AI companies have dramatically increased automated scraping through direct crawling, APIs, and bulk downloads to feed their hungry AI models. This exponential growth in non-human traffic has imposed steep technical and financial costs—often without the attribution that helps sustain Wikimedia’s volunteer ecosystem.The impact isn’t theoretical. The foundation says that when former US President Jimmy Carter died in December 2024, his Wikipedia page predictably drew millions of views. But the real stress came when users simultaneously streamed a 1.5-hour video of a 1980 debate from Wikimedia Commons. The surge doubled Wikimedia’s normal network traffic, temporarily maxing out several of its Internet connections. Wikimedia engineers quickly rerouted traffic to reduce congestion, but the event revealed a deeper problem: The baseline bandwidth had already been consumed largely by bots scraping media at scale.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2298 - Kurt Metzger</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJbKgC_bMpI</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bJbKgC_bMpI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 2 Apr 2025 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kurt Metzger is a stand-up comic, writer, and host of the "Can't Get Right with Kurt Metzger" podcast.

Speaking on the 20VC podcast, Scott said AI would not replace software engineers but transform their role. "It doesn't mean that the AI is doing the software engineering job.... authorship is still going to be human," Scott said. 

According to Scott, developers will shift from writing code directly to guiding AI through prompts and instructions. "We go from being an input master (programming languages) to a prompt master (AI orchestrator)," he said. Scott said the current AI systems have significant memory limitations, making them "awfully transactional," but predicted improvements within the next year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is One Of The Weirdest Plants You&apos;ll Ever See | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi9WSrP_bew</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/oi9WSrP_bew?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 2 Apr 2025 16:01:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Grown all over the mountains of southern Mexico, "giant maize" and its mysterious mucus could help feed the planet and end farming’s toxic reliance on chemical fertilisers.

South Korea is heading toward a demographic collapse unlike anything the world has seen before. With the lowest fertility rate ever recorded and a rapidly aging population, the country faces a future of economic decline, shrinking cities, cultural erosion, and a vanishing workforce. 
By 2060, nearly half of South Koreans could be over the age of 65, and entire regions may be abandoned as the population continues to shrink.
How did South Korea reach this point? Why might it no longer be possible to reverse the trend? And what does this mean for other countries on a similar path?

Like many others, it was planted by Allied soldiers in the dead of night. A hollow replica of the real tree that stood there before. But why did they do it? What are they made of? And how did these trees help to change the face of conflict forever?

During the First World War, Allied soldiers needed a way to see without being seen. The solution was the camouflage tree, a fake piece of shrubbery with an observation post hidden inside. Initially a French invention, the camouflage tree would allow Allied soldiers to keep track of enemy movements from a concealed elevated position.

 package might have encountered some of
its various pitfalls. Go 1.24 introduces a new way to write benchmarks that’s just
as easy to use, but at the same time far more robust:
.Traditionally, Go benchmarks are written using a loop from 0 to :func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  for range b.N {
    ... code to measure ...
  }
}
Using  instead is a trivial change:func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  for b.Loop() {
    ... code to measure ...
  }
}
 has many benefits:It prevents unwanted compiler optimizations within the benchmark loop.It automatically excludes setup and cleanup code from benchmark timing.Code can’t accidentally depend on the total number of iterations or the current
iteration.These were all easy mistakes to make with -style benchmarks that would
silently result in bogus benchmark results. As an added bonus, -style
benchmarks even complete in less time!Let’s explore the advantages of  and how to effectively utilize it.Old benchmark loop problemsBefore Go 1.24, while the basic structure of a benchmark was simple, more sophisticated
benchmarks required more care:func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  ... setup ...
  b.ResetTimer() // if setup may be expensive
  for range b.N {
    ... code to measure ...
    ... use sinks or accumulation to prevent dead-code elimination ...
  }
  b.StopTimer() // if cleanup or reporting may be expensive
  ... cleanup ...
  ... report ...
}
If setup or cleanup are non-trivial, the developer needs to surround the benchmark loop
with  and/or  calls. These are easy to forget, and even if the
developer remembers they may be necessary, it can be difficult to judge whether setup or
cleanup are “expensive enough” to require them.Without these, the  package can only time the entire benchmark function. If a
benchmark function omits them, the setup and cleanup code will be included in the overall
time measurement, silently skewing the final benchmark result.There is another, more subtle pitfall that requires deeper understanding:
(Example source)func isCond(b byte) bool {
  if b%3 == 1 && b%7 == 2 && b%17 == 11 && b%31 == 9 {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

func BenchmarkIsCondWrong(b *testing.B) {
  for range b.N {
    isCond(201)
  }
}
In this example, the user might observe  executing in sub-nanosecond
time. CPUs are fast, but not that fast! This seemingly anomalous result stems
from the fact that  is inlined, and since its result is never used, the
compiler eliminates it as dead code. As a result, this benchmark doesn’t measure 
at all; it measures how long it takes to do nothing. In this case, the sub-nanosecond
result is a clear red flag, but in more complex benchmarks, partial dead-code elimination
can lead to results that look reasonable but still aren’t measuring what was intended.Unlike a -style benchmark,  is able to track when it is first called
in a benchmark when the final iteration ends. The  at the loop’s start
and  at its end are integrated into , eliminating the need
to manually manage the benchmark timer for setup and cleanup code.Furthermore, the Go compiler now detects loops where the condition is just a call to
 and prevents dead code elimination within the loop. In Go 1.24, this is
implemented by disallowing inlining into the body of such a loop, but we plan to
improve this in the future.Another nice feature of  is its one-shot ramp-up approach. With a -style
benchmark, the testing package must call the benchmark function several times with different
values of , ramping up until the measured time reached a threshold. In contrast, 
can simply run the benchmark loop until it reaches the time threshold, and only needs to call
the benchmark function once. Internally,  still uses a ramp-up process to amortize
measurement overhead, but this is hidden from the caller and can be more efficient.Certain constraints of the -style loop still apply to the -style
loop. It remains the user’s responsibility to manage the timer within the benchmark loop,
when necessary:
(Example source)func BenchmarkSortInts(b *testing.B) {
  ints := make([]int, N)
  for b.Loop() {
    b.StopTimer()
    fillRandomInts(ints)
    b.StartTimer()
    slices.Sort(ints)
  }
}
In this example, to benchmark the in-place sorting performance of ,a
randomly initialized array is required for each iteration. The user must still
manually manage the timer in such cases.Furthermore, there still needs to be exactly one such loop in the benchmark function body
(a -style loop cannot coexist with a -style loop), and every iteration of the
loop should do the same thing.The  method is now the preferred way to write benchmarks:func Benchmark(b *testing.B) {
  ... setup ...
  for b.Loop() {
    // optional timer control for in-loop setup/cleanup
    ... code to measure ...
  }
  ... cleanup ...
}
 offers faster, more accurate, and
more intuitive benchmarking.A huge thank you to everyone in the community who provided feedback on the proposal
issue and reported bugs as this feature was released! I’m also grateful to Eli
Bendersky for his helpful blog summaries. And finally a big thank you to Austin Clements,
Cherry Mui and Michael Pratt for their review, thoughtful work on the design options and
documentation improvements.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice sit down with planetary scientist Rick Binzel, the creator of the Torino Scale, to discuss asteroid hazards, the results of the asteroid sample return, and the search for Planet 9.

Rick, a former MIT professor and OSIRIS-REx investigator, has been obsessed with asteroids since he published his first paper at age 15. He and Neil go way back—both attended the same nocturnal astronomy camp, where they spent their nights scanning the cosmos. Learn how Rick helped measure Pluto’s moon transiting in front of the dwarf planet—revealing Pluto’s real size for the first time.

We break down the Torino Scale, a 10-point system that categorizes asteroid impact risk. What does it mean when an asteroid has a 1.3% chance of hitting Earth? How do astronomers refine those probabilities over time? We discuss YR-4, an asteroid with a fluctuating impact risk, and the cosmic game of uncertainty. Why do asteroid impact predictions sometimes look like a spaghetti string of possibilities?

Then, we turn to Apophis, the “God of Chaos” asteroid that will pass closer than some satellites in 2029. With OSIRIS-APEX set to visit it post-flyby, what can we learn about its composition? Plus, we get the latest on the OSIRIS-REx mission—what did its asteroid sample reveal about the origins of life?

And finally, is there a hidden ninth planet lurking beyond Pluto? Some scientists see hints in the Kuiper Belt, while Chuck Nice has his own theory: a giant alien mothership. Neil and Rick debate what it would take to confirm (or debunk) Planet 9’s existence. All this and more, on StarTalk!

--

For millennia, livestock farmers strategically guided animals to seasonal grazing areas. This mobile way of life, known as pastoralism, provided them with wealth, social status, and political independence into the 20th century. But in the last century, political and economic policies have worked against these communities. Take a closer look at the challenges of modern pastoralism.

By default, Textual will arrange your widgets starting at the top of the screen and appending them in a vertically oriented stack. Each GUI or TUI toolkit provides a way to lay out your widgets. Textual is no different in this respect. They use an object called a .You can use containers to create the following types of layouts:You will be learning how to use all three of these types of layouts. You will also learn how to add more widgets at runtime.Creating a Vertical LayoutThe default orientation in Textual is to arrange widgets vertically. You don’t even need to use a CSS file to apply this orientation.But what does a vertical layout mean anyway? A vertical layout is when you add widgets to your application vertically, from top to bottom. Here is an illustration of what that might look like:Adding widgets to a Textual application will lay out the widgets similarly to the image above. If you want to see that for yourself, then open up your Python editor and create a new file named `vertical.py`.Then enter the following code into your new script:# vertical.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button


class VerticalApp(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("OK")
        yield Button("Cancel")
        yield Button("Go!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = VerticalApp()
    app.run()Now open up a terminal and run your code. When you do so, you will see three buttons onscreen, with the topmost being your “OK” button and the bottom being the “Go!” button.Here is a screenshot of the application to give you an idea of what it looks like:
You can change the widget size, color, and more using each widget’s  attribute, but using CSS is simpler. Let’s update the code above to use a  file:# verical_css.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button


class VerticalApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "vertical.tcss"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("OK")
        yield Button("Cancel")
        yield Button("Go!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = VerticalApp()
    app.run()Now that you are referring to a CSS file, you should go ahead and write one. If you don’t, you will get an error when you attempt to run the code that says the CSS file could not be found.Go ahead and open your favorite text editor or use your Python editor to create a file named `vertical.tcss`. Then enter the following code:Screen {
    layout: vertical;
}

Button {
    width: 100%;
    color: yellow;
    background: red;
}You do not need the  portion of the CSS since that is technically taken care of automatically by Textual. Remember,  is the default widget when you launch an application. However, it is always good to be explicit so you understand what is happening. If you want the output to look exactly like the previous example, you can delete this CSS’s  portion and try running the code that way.If you decide to include the  portion of the CSS, you will make all of the  widgets 100% wide, which means they will all stretch across the entire width of the screen. The CSS also defines the button text to be yellow and the buttons themselves to have a read background color.When you run this code, you will see something like the following:That’s a fun way to change your vertically oriented widget layout. But what happens if you set the height of the  widgets to 50%? Well, you have three widgets. Three times 50 will be 150%, which is greater than what can be shown all at once. Textual will add a scrollbar if you add widgets that go off-screen.Try adding that setting to your CSS and re-run the code. You should see something like the following:You should spend a few moments trying out various width and height sizes. Remember, you don’t have to use percentages. You can also use Textual’s other unit types.: All style attributes can be adjusted at runtime, which means you can modify the layout at runtime, too. Use this wisely so as not to confuse the user!When you finish experimenting, you will be ready to learn how horizontal layouts work!Laying widgets out horizontally, left-to-right, requires a little more work than laying them out vertically. But the change is still pretty minor, and in many ways, it affects only one line in the CSS file.But before you change the CSS, you will want to update your Python code to point to the new CSS file. Open your Python editor and copy the previous example to a new file. Save it with the same  and update the  to point to a new CSS file named :# horizontal.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button


class HorizontalApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "horizontal.tcss"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("OK")
        yield Button("Cancel")
        yield Button("Go!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = HorizontalApp()
    app.run()Yes, this code is almost the same as the previous example, except the  variable. That’s okay. The point is to show you how you can change the layout.Create your  file in a Python or text editor to make a horizontally oriented layout. Then enter the following CSS:Screen {
    layout: horizontal;
}

Button {
    height: 100%;
    color: yellow;
    background: red;
    border: solid green;
}The CSS above added a border to the buttons to make them stand out a bit more. Depending on the terminal, the widgets appear to blend together more when arranged horizontally. You can add space around the widgets by setting the  style, though.When you run this code, you should see something like the following:When using a horizontal layout, the horizontal scrollbar will not automatically appear if the widgets do not fit the screen. If you want to have a horizontal scrollbar, then you will need to set , like in the following CSS:Screen {
    layout: horizontal;
    overflow-x: auto;
}

Button {
    height: 100%;
    color: yellow;
    background: red;
    border: solid green;
}Now, set the widgets’ width to greater than 33% so that the scrollbar will appear. Spend some time experimenting, and you’ll soon figure it out!The Textual package has several utility containers you can use to lay out your widgets. You are most likely to use , , or  containers. You can also combine the containers to create more complex layouts.Here is a full list of the containers included with Textual at the time of writing:You will most likely use the , , , and  containers the most.Practicing is the best learning method, especially when laying out user interfaces. You can start your container journey by opening your Python editor and creating a new file called . Then enter the following code:# horizontal_container.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button
from textual.containers import Horizontal


class HorizontalApp(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Horizontal(
            Button("OK"),
            Button("Cancel"),
            Button("Go!"),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = HorizontalApp()
    app.run()You import the  container from . The main contents of a container is its widgets. You reuse the widgets from the previous example here. Pay attention and note that you do not need to use  inside the container. You can simply add the widget instances instead.When you run this code, you will see something like this:What will happen if you use your  file with this code? Try adding it to the code above and re-run your example.The result will look familiar:The real benefit using containers comes when you nest them. You’ll find out about that concept next!Nesting containers allows you to combine horizontally and vertically oriented widgets, resulting in rows and columns of widgets. This design pattern can create some pretty nice layouts.To start, create a new file called  in your Python editor. Then add this code to it:# nested_containers.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical


class NestedApp(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Vertical(
            Horizontal(
                Button("One"),
                Button("Two"),
                classes="row",
            ),
            Horizontal(
                Button("Three"),
                Button("Four"),
                classes="row",
            ),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = NestedApp()
    app.run()Your code above has a single  container with two  containers inside. You can think of the  containers as “rows”. You can see that you set the  parameters to “row” to identify them. Each row contains two  widgets.When you run this code, you will see something like this:This example doesn’t use any CSS. You should do that! Update the code to include a CSS file called , like the code below:# nested_containers.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.widgets import Button
from textual.containers import Horizontal, Vertical


class NestedApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "nested.tcss"

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Vertical(
            Horizontal(
                Button("One"),
                Button("Two"),
                classes="row",
            ),
            Horizontal(
                Button("Three"),
                Button("Four"),
                classes="row",
            ),
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = NestedApp()
    app.run()Then, create the  file. You will be putting the following CSS rules into it:Button {
    content-align: center middle;
    background: green;
    border: yellow;
    height: 1fr;
    width: 1fr;
}Here, you set various rules for the  widgets to follow. You want the buttons to be green with a yellow border. You also set the width and height to , which causes the buttons to expand to fit all the horizontal and vertical space.When you run this version of your code, you can see that the user interface has changed significantly:Nice! You should spend some time adjusting the style rules and seeing how to change these layouts.Learning how to create layouts is a fundamental skill that you will need to master to be able to create engaging, intuitive user interfaces. Fortunately, Textual gives you enough tools that you can create your user interfaces fairly easily. No; you don’t get a What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) tool as you do with some GUI toolkits, such as QT Creator. But you do get live-coding with CSS, and since most of your user interface layouts are controlled there, tweaking the user interface is so nicer.Want to Learn More Textual?You will learn everything you need to know about Textual from this book.

Despite a fundamental difference in direction that led Anthropic's founders to quit OpenAI in 2020 and later create the Claude AI assistant, a shared technical hurdle has now brought them together: How to easily connect their AI models to external data sources.The solution comes from Anthropic, which developed and released an open specification called Model Context Protocol (MCP) in November 2024. MCP establishes a royalty-free protocol that allows AI models to connect with outside data sources and services without requiring unique integrations for each service."Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications," wrote Anthropic in MCP's documentation. The analogy is imperfect, but it represents the idea that, similar to how USB-C unified various cables and ports (with admittedly a debatable level of success), MCP aims to standardize how AI models connect to the infoscape around them.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sourcegraph and the Frontier of AI in Software Engineering with Beyang Liu</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/04/01/sourcegraph-and-the-frontier-of-ai-in-software-engineering-with-beyang-liu/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=sourcegraph-and-the-frontier-of-ai-in-software-engineering-with-beyang-liu</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2476129588.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 1 Apr 2025 09:00:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sourcegraph is a powerful code search and intelligence tool that helps developers navigate and understand large codebases efficiently.

While AI undeniably impacts the way we write code, it hasn't fundamentally changed our role as engineers. Allow me to explain. 

[...] Vibe coding is interacting with the codebase via prompts. As the implementation is hidden from the "vibe coder", all the engineering concerns will inevitably get ignored. Many of the concerns are hard to express in a prompt, and many of them are hard to verify by only inspecting the final artifact. Historically, all engineering practices have tried to shift all those concerns left -- to the earlier stages of development when they're cheap to address. Yet with vibe coding, they're shifted very far to the right -- when addressing them is expensive. 

The question of whether an AI system can perform the complete engineering cycle and build and evolve software the same way a human can remains open. However, there are no signs of it being able to do so at this point, and if it one day happens, it won't have anything to do with vibe coding -- at least the way it's defined today. 

[...] It is possible that there'll be a future where software is built from vibe-coded blocks, but the work of designing software able to evolve and scale doesn't go away. That's not vibe engineering -- that's just engineering, even if the coding part of it will look a bit different.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Open Source Genetic Database Shuts Down To Protect Users From &apos;Authoritarian Governments&apos;</title><link>https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/03/31/1926246/open-source-genetic-database-shuts-down-to-protect-users-from-authoritarian-governments?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from 404 Media: The creator of an open source genetic database is shutting it down and deleting all of its data because he has come to believe that its existence is dangerous with "a rise in far-right and other authoritarian governments" in the United States and elsewhere. "The largest use case for DTC genetic data was not biomedical research or research in big pharma," Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, the founder of OpenSNP, wrote in a blog post. "Instead, the transformative impact of the data came to fruition among law enforcement agencies, who have put the genealogical properties of genetic data to use."
 
OpenSNP has collected roughly 7,500 genomes over the last 14 years, primarily by allowing people to voluntarily submit their own genetic information they have downloaded from 23andMe. With the bankruptcy of 23andMe, increased interest in genetic data by law enforcement, and the return of Donald Trump and rise of authoritarian governments worldwide, Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media he no longer believes it is ethical to run the database. "I've been thinking about it since 23andMe was on the verge of bankruptcy and been really considering it since the U.S. election. It definitely is really bad over there [in the United States]," Greshake Tzovaras told 404 Media. "I am quite relieved to have made the decision and come to a conclusion. It's been weighing on my mind for a long time."
 
Greshake Tzovaras said that he is proud of the OpenSNP project, but that, in a world where scientific data is being censored and deleted and where the Trump administration has focused on criminalizing immigrants and trans people, he now believes that the most responsible thing to do is to delete the data and shut down the project. "Most people in OpenSNP may not be at particular risk right now, but there are people from vulnerable populations in here as well," Greshake Tzovaras said. "Thinking about gender representation, minorities, sexual orientation -- 23andMe has been working on the whole 'gay gene' thing, it's conceivable that this would at some point in the future become an issue." "Across the globe there is a rise in far-right and other authoritarian governments. While they are cracking down on free and open societies, they are also dedicated to replacing scientific thought and reasoning with pseudoscience across disciplines," Greshake Tzovaras wrote. "The risk/benefit calculus of providing free & open access to individual genetic data in 2025 is very different compared to 14 years ago. And so, sunsetting openSNP -- along with deleting the data stored within it -- feels like it is the most responsible act of stewardship for these data today."
 
"The interesting thing to me is there are data preservation efforts in the U.S. because the government is deleting scientific data that they don't like. This is approaching that same problem from a different direction," he added. "We need to protect the people in this database. I am supportive of preserving scientific data and knowledge, but the data comes second -- the people come first. We prefer deleting the data."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The idealization of farming by tech (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/138</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/138/changelog-news-138.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Theodore Morley wonders why tech workers so frequently point our wanderlust toward hands-on trades, Eduardo Bouças explains why he’s lost confidence in Vercel’s handling of Next.js, “xan” is a command line tool that can be used to process CSV files directly from the shell, Pawel Brodzinski takes us back to Kanban’s roots &  Sergey Tselovalnikov weighs in on vibe coding.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

"I no longer think you should learn to code," Masad wrote on X. 

The statement comes as major tech executives report significant AI inroads into software development. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that 25% of new code at the tech giant is AI-generated, though still reviewed by engineers. Furthermore, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted AI could generate up to 90% of all code within six months. 

Masad called this shift a "bittersweet realization" after spending years popularizing coding through open-source work, Codecademy, and Replit -- a platform that now uses AI to help users build apps and websites. Instead of syntax-focused programming skills, Masad recommends learning "how to think, how to break down problems... how to communicate clearly, with humans and with machines."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This &quot;Fake&quot; Heart Saved a Life</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7cuOS7nmDY</link><author>ColdFusion</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/f7cuOS7nmDY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 16:27:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A">ColdFusion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Try Brilliant for free at https://brilliant.org/coldfusion - you'll also get 20% off an annual Premium subscription.

Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been called the most unqualified health secretary in the history of the US. Before his confirmation, over 22,000 doctors signed a letter urging the Senate to reject his appointment. During the confirmation hearing several senators grilled him on his concerning history related to vaccine misinformation: things like his founding of an anti-vax organization, his concerning anti-vax rhetoric, and his history of suing vaccine manufacturers, something he stands to make a lot of money doing. 

The former environmental lawyer was propelled to the nation’s highest health office largely by the “MAHA” movement, a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan (“Make America Healthy Again”). As health secretary, Kennedy wants to solve the chronic disease epidemic in the US, which plenty of doctors can get behind. The issue is that he aims to do it at the expense of infectious disease research. And therein lies the problem. Most people can agree when he says things like “I’m supportive of vaccines” and “I want good science.” The trouble is that his definition of “good” is, well — let’s call it historically shaky. In March, he appointed a well-known vaccine skeptic to head a study on the long-debunked potential link between vaccines and autism.

So what’s next? Can RFK Jr. take away vaccines that are already on the market? It’s unlikely, but he doesn’t need to. Kennedy sits at the helm of the very department he’s been undermining for years. In that position, the power he has over vaccine policy isn’t limitless, but the changes he can make could ripple for decades.

The new "hdrtest" code is for the Intel Xe kernel driver and is around trying to help ensure the Direct Rendering Manager header files are self-contained and pass kernel-doc tests — basic maintenance checks on the included DRM header files to ensure they are all in good shape. 

But Torvalds accused the code of not only slowing down the full-kernel builds, but also leaving behind "random" files for dependencies "that then make the source tree nasty," reports Tom's Hardware:

While Torvalds was disturbed by the code that was impacting the latest Linux kernel, beginning his post with a "Grr," he remained precise in his objections to it. "I did the pull, resolved the (trivial) conflicts, but I notice that this ended up containing the disgusting 'hdrtest' crap that (a) slows down the build because it's done for a regular allmodconfig build rather than be some simple thing that you guys can run as needed (b) also leaves random 'hdrtest' turds around in the include directories," he wrote. 

Torvalds went on to state that he had previously complained about this issue, and inquired why the hdr testing is being done as a regular part of the build. Moreover, he highlighted that the resulting 'turds' were breaking filename completion. Torvalds underlined this point — and his disgust — by stating, "this thing needs to *die*." In a shot of advice to fellow Linux developers, Torvalds said, "If you want to do that hdrtest thing, do it as part of your *own* checks. Don't make everybody else see that disgusting thing...." 
He then noted that he had decided to mark hdrtest as broken for now, to prevent its inclusion in regular builds.
 

As of Saturday, all of the DRM-Next code had made it into Linux 6.15 Git, notes Phoronix. "But Linus Torvalds is expecting all this 'hdrtest' mess to be cleaned up."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Copilot Can&apos;t Beat a 2013 &apos;TouchDevelop&apos; Code Generation Demo for Windows Phone</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/30/2333226/copilot-cant-beat-a-2013-touchdevelop-code-generation-demo-for-windows-phone?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 00:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What happens when you ask Copilot to "write a program that can be run on an iPhone 16 to select 15 random photos from the phone, tint them to random colors, and display the photos on the phone"? 

That's what TouchDevelop did for the long-discontinued Windows Phone in a 2013 Microsoft Research 'SmartSynth' natural language code generation demo. ("Write scripts by tapping on the screen.") 

Long-time Slashdot reader theodp reports on what happens when, 14 years later, you pose the same question to Copilot:

"You'll get lots of code and caveats from Copilot, but nothing that you can execute as is. (Compare that to the functioning 10 lines of code TouchDevelop program). It's a good reminder that just because GenAI can generate code, it doesn't necessarily mean it will generate the least amount of code, the most understandable or appropriate code for the requestor, or code that runs unchanged and produces the desired results. 
theodp also reminds us that TouchDevelop "was (like BASIC) abandoned by Microsoft..."


Interestingly, a Microsoft Research video from CS Education Week 2011 shows enthusiastic Washington high school students participating in an hour-long TouchDevelop coding lesson and demonstrating the apps they created that tapped into music, photos, the Internet, and yes, even their phone's functionality. This shows how lacking iPhone and Android still are today as far as easy programmability-for-the-masses goes. (When asked, Copilot replied that Apple's Shortcuts app wasn't up to the task).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Francis Drake (Part 1)</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/francis-drake-part-1</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67e5849d3e4472feec235228/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=EwQodpJfvzhhjUL-Ik0L_T9rcgkfBaoALzamcbJKzIE" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Douglas Murray: Putin, Zelenskyy, Trump, Israel, Netanyahu, Hamas &amp; Gaza | Lex Fridman Podcast #463</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvI42TyE5Ww</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HvI42TyE5Ww?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 20:12:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Douglas Murray is the author of On Democracies and Death Cults, The War on The West, and The Madness of Crowds.

While there's documentation and tutorials — there's no official language specification:

In December 2022, an RFC was submitted to encourage the Rust Project to begin working on a specification. After much discussion, the RFC was approved in July 2023, and work began. 

Initially, the Rust Project specification team (t-spec) were interested in creating the document from scratch using the Rust Reference as a guiding marker. However, the team knew there was already an external Rust specification that was being used successfully for compiler qualification purposes — the FLS. 

Thank Berlin-based Ferrous Systems, a Rust-based consultancy who assembled that description "some years ago," according to a post on the Rust blog:
 They've since been faithfully maintaining and updating this document for new versions of Rust, and they've successfully used it to qualify toolchains based on Rust for use in safety-critical industries. [The Rust Foundation notes it part of the consultancy's "Ferrocene" Rust compiler/toolchain.] Seeing this success, others have also begun to rely on the FLS for their own qualification efforts when building with Rust. 

The Rust Foundation explains:

The FLS provides a structured and detailed reference for Rust's syntax, semantics, and behavior, serving as a foundation for verification, compliance, and standardization efforts. Since Rust did not have an official language specification back then, nor a plan to write one, the FLS represented a major step toward describing Rust in a way that aligns with industry requirements, particularly in high-assurance domains. 

And the Rust Project is "passionate about shipping high quality tools that enable people to build reliable software at scale," adds the Rust blog. So...

It's in that light that we're pleased to announce that we'll be adopting the FLS into the Rust Project as part of our ongoing specification efforts. This adoption is being made possible by the gracious donation of the FLS by Ferrous Systems. We're grateful to them for the work they've done in assembling the FLS, in making it fit for qualification purposes, in promoting its use and the use of Rust generally in safety-critical industries, and now, for working with us to take the next step and to bring the FLS into the Project. 

With this adoption, we look forward to better integrating the FLS with the processes of the Project and to providing ongoing and increased assurances to all those who use Rust in safety-critical industries and, in particular, to those who use the FLS as part of their qualification efforts. 

More from the Rust Foundation:

The t-spec team wanted to avoid potential confusion from having two highly visible Rust specifications in the industry and so decided it would be worthwhile to try to integrate the FLS with the Rust Reference to create the official Rust Project specification. They approached Ferrous Systems, which agreed to contribute its FLS to the Rust Project and allow the Rust Project to take over its development and management... This generous donation will provide a clearer path to delivering an official Rust specification. It will also empower the Rust Project to oversee its ongoing evolution, providing confidence to companies and individuals already relying on the FLS, and marking a major milestone for the Rust ecosystem. 

"I really appreciate Ferrous taking this step to provide their specification to the Rust Project," said Joel Marcey, Director of Technology at the Rust Foundation and member of the t-spec team. "They have already done a massive amount of legwork...." This effort will provide others who require a Rust specification with an official, authoritative reference for their work with the Rust programming language... This is an exciting outcome. A heartfelt thank you to the Ferrous Systems team for their invaluable contribution! 

Marcey said the move allows the team "to supercharge our progress in the delivery of an official Rust specification." 

And the co-founder of Ferrous Systems, Felix Gilcher, also sounded excited. "We originally created the Ferrocene Language Specification to provide a structured and reliable description of Rust for the certification of the Ferrocene compiler. As an open source-first company, contributing the FLS to the Rust Project is a logical step toward fostering the development of a unified, community-driven specification that benefits all Rust users."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Before Pangea: The Supercontinents</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cU9i-JGgPQ</link><author>SEA</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6cU9i-JGgPQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:30:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG9ShGbASoiwHwFcLcAh9EA">SEA</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Long ago, the Earth's seven continents were assembled in a giant, sprawling supercontinent known as Pangea. You may've heard of it, but what is often less talked about is what came before Pangea. Our planet's current continental chunks have been smashing together and separating for over four billion years, and there have been more than a few "supercontinents" during that time. Those lost lands take the stage in this video, as we wind the clock back to the age of the supercontinents before Pangea.

This one has been in the pipeline for many months. It is slightly different to the usual astronomy content but I hope you will all enjoy it just the same.

He explores AI’s role in job interviews, personalized AI assistants, and the evolving nature of human-computer interaction. Key topics include AI-driven self-analysis, context-aware AI systems, and the impact of AI on optimizing human decision-making. The conversation highlights how AI can enhance creativity, collaboration, and efficiency by reducing cognitive load and making intelligent suggestions in real time.Fausto Albers is a relentless explorer of the unconventional—a techno-optimist with a foundation in sociology and behavioral economics, always connecting seemingly absurd ideas that, upon closer inspection, turn out to be the missing pieces of a bigger puzzle. He thrives in paradox: he overcomplicates the simple, oversimplifies the complex, and yet somehow lands on solutions that feel inevitable in hindsight. He believes that true innovation exists in the tension between chaos and structure—too much of either, and you’re stuck.His career has been anything but linear. He’s owned and operated successful restaurants, served high-stakes cocktails while juggling bottles on London’s bar tops, and later traded spirits for code—designing digital waiters, recommender systems, and AI-driven accounting tools. Now, he leads the AI Builders Club Amsterdam, a fast-growing community where AI engineers, researchers, and founders push the boundaries of intelligent systems.Ask him about RAG, and he’ll insist on specificity—because, as he puts it, discussing retrieval-augmented generation without clear definitions is as useful as declaring that “AI will have an impact on the world.” An engaging communicator, a sharp systems thinker, and a builder of both technology and communities, Fausto is here to challenge perspectives, deconstruct assumptions, and remix the future of AI.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~Catch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://go.mlops.community/TYExploreJoin our slack community [https://go.mlops.community/slack]Follow us on X/Twitter [@mlopscommunity](https://x.com/mlopscommunity) or [LinkedIn](https://go.mlops.community/linkedin)] Sign up for the next meetup: [https://go.mlops.community/register]MLOps Swag/Merch: [https://shop.mlops.community/]Connect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: /dpbrinkmConnect with Fausto on LinkedIn: /stepintoliquid]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft Announces &apos;Hyperlight Wasm&apos;: Speedy VM-Based Security at Scale with a WebAssembly Runtime</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/30/0627205/microsoft-announces-hyperlight-wasm-speedy-vm-based-security-at-scale-with-a-webassembly-runtime?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cloud providers like the security of running things in virtual machines "at scale" — even though VMs "are not known for having fast cold starts or a small footprint..." noted Microsoft's Open Source blog last November. So Microsoft's Azure Core Upstream team built an open source Rust library called Hyperlight "to execute functions as fast as possible while isolating those functions within a VM." 

But that was just the beginning...

 Then, we showed how to run Rust functions really, really fast, followed by using C to [securely] run Javascript. In February 2025, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) voted to onboard Hyperlight into their Sandbox program [for early-stage projects]. 

[This week] we're announcing the release of Hyperlight Wasm: a Hyperlight virtual machine "micro-guest" that can run wasm component workloads written in many programming languages... 

Traditional virtual machines do a lot of work to be able to run programs. Not only do they have to load an entire operating system, they also boot up the virtual devices that the operating system depends on. Hyperlight is fast because it doesn't do that work; all it exposes to its VM guests is a linear slice of memory and a CPU. No virtual devices. No operating system. But this speed comes at the cost of compatibility. Chances are that your current production application expects a Linux operating system running on the x86-64 architecture (hardware), not a bare linear slice of memory... 

[B]uilding Hyperlight with a WebAssembly runtime — wasmtime — enables any programming language to execute in a protected Hyperlight micro-VM without any prior knowledge of Hyperlight at all. As far as program authors are concerned, they're just compiling for the wasm32-wasip2 target... Executing workloads in the Hyperlight Wasm guest isn't just possible for compiled languages like C, Go, and Rust, but also for interpreted languages like Python, JavaScript, and C#. The trick here, much like with containers, is to also include a language runtime as part of the image... Programming languages, runtimes, application platforms, and cloud providers are all starting to offer rich experiences for WebAssembly out of the box. If we do things right, you will never need to think about whether your application is running inside of a Hyperlight Micro-VM in Azure. You may never know your workload is executing in a Hyperlight Micro VM. And that's a good thing. 

While a traditional virtual-device-based VM takes about 125 milliseconds to load, "When the Hyperlight VMM creates a new VM, all it needs do to is create a new slice of memory and load the VM guest, which in turn loads the wasm workload. This takes about 1-2 milliseconds today, and work is happening to bring that number to be less than 1 millisecond in the future." 

And there's also double security due to Wasmtime's software-defined runtime sandbox within Hyperlight's larger VM...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline: The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air - The Complete History Of The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69j2gg_OICw</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/69j2gg_OICw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today on Weird History we are taking a deep look into 'The Fresh Prince of Bel Air'!

And over the past 8 years as a Software Engineer, I’ve seen them used repeatedly when building and scaling large systems.I’ve also included links to detailed articles I’ve written on several of these topics, so you can dive deeper whenever you’d like.I also recently created a  that quickly walks through all 30 concepts—packed with visuals and animations to make everything easier to understand.Subscribe for more such videos!1. Client-Server ArchitectureAlmost every web application that you use is built on this simple yet powerful concept called client-server architecture.On one side, you have a —this could be a web browser, a mobile app, or any other frontend application.and on the other side, you have a —a machine that runs continuously, waiting to handle incoming requests.The client sends a request to store, retrieve, or modify data.The server receives the request, processes it, performs the necessary operations, and sends back a response.This sounds simple, but there’s a big question: How does the client even know where to find the server?A client doesn’t magically know where a server is, it needs an  to locate and communicate with it.On the internet, computers identify each other using , which work like phone numbers for servers.Every publicly deployed server has a . When a client wants to interact with a service, it must send requests to the correct IP address.When we visit a website, we don’t type its IP address—we just enter the website name.We can’t expect users (or even systems) to memorize a string of random numbers for every service they connect to.And if we migrate our service to another server, its IP address may change—breaking all direct connections.Instead of relying on hard-to-remember IP addresses, we use something much more human-friendly: .But, we need a way to map a domain name to it’s corresponding IP address.This is where DNS (or Domain Name System) comes in. It maps easy to remember domain names (like algomaster.io) to their corresponding IP addresses.Here’s what happens behind the scenes:When you type  into your browser, your computer asks a DNS server for the corresponding IP address.Once the DNS server responds with the IP, your browser uses it to establish a connection with the server and make a request.You can find the IP address of any domain using the  command. Just open your terminal and type ping followed by the domain name. And it’ll return the IP address currently assigned to that domain.When you visit a website, your request doesn’t always go directly to the server—sometimes, it passes through a  or  first.A  acts as a  between your device and the internet.When you request a webpage, the proxy forwards your request to the target server, retrieves the response, and sends it back to you.Proxy hides your IP address, keeping your location and identity private.A  works the other way around. It intercepts client requests and forwards them to backend servers based on predefined rules.Allowing direct access to servers can pose , exposing them to threats like  and .A reverse proxy mitigates these risks by acting as a controlled entry point that regulates incoming traffic and hides server IPs.It can also act as a load balancer, distributing traffic across multiple servers.If you want to learn about Proxy vs Reverse Proxy in more detail, checkout this article:Whenever a client communicates with a server, there’s always some delay. One of the biggest causes of this delay is .For example, if our server is in , but a user in  sends a request, the data has to travel halfway across the world—and then the response has to make the same long trip back.This round-trip delay is called —the total time it takes for data to travel between the client and the server. High latency can make applications feel slow and unresponsive.One way to  is by deploying our service across multiple data centers worldwide.This way, users can connect to the  server instead of waiting for data to travel across the globe.Once a connection is made, how do clients and servers actually communicate?Every time you visit a website, your browser and the server communicate using a set of rules called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).That’s why most URLs start with  or its secure version, .The  sends a request to the server. This request includes a  (containing details like the request type, browser type, and cookies) and sometimes a  (which carries additional data, like form inputs).The  processes the request and responds with an —either returning the requested data or an error message if something goes wrong.HTTP has a major security flaw, it . This is a serious problem, especially for sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, and personal data.That’s why modern websites use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead. HTTPS encrypts all data using  ensuring that even if someone intercepts the request, they can’t read or alter it.But clients and servers don’t directly exchange raw HTTP requests and response.HTTP is just a  for transferring data but it doesn’t define:How requests should be structuredWhat format responses should be inor how different clients should interact with the server.This is where APIs (or Application Programming Interfaces) come in.Think of an API as a  that allows clients (like web and mobile apps) to communicate with servers without worrying about low-level details.Almost every digital service you use—social media, e-commerce, online banking, ride-hailing apps—is built on APIs working together behind the scenes.Here’s how it typically works:A  sends a request to an API.The , hosted on a server, processes the request, interacts with databases or other services, and prepares a response.The API sends back the response in a structured format, usually  or , which the client understands and can display.APIs provide a —the client doesn’t need to know  the server processes the request, only that it returns the expected data.If you want to learn more about APIs, checkout this article:But, not all APIs are built the same. Different API styles exist to serve different needs. Two of the most popular ones are  and .Among the different API styles, REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most widely used.A  follows a set of rules that define how clients and servers communicate over HTTP in a structured way. Every request is independent; the server doesn’t store client state. Everything is treated as a resource (e.g., /users, /orders, /products).Uses Standard HTTP Methods: Clients interact with resources using  like: → Retrieves data (e.g., fetching a user profile). → Creates new data (e.g., adding a new user). → Updates existing data (e.g., changing user settings). → Removes data (e.g., deleting an account).REST APIs are great because they’re simple, scalable, and easy to cache, but they have , especially when dealing with complex data retrieval.REST endpoints often return , leading to inefficient network usage. If an API doesn’t return related data, the client may need to  to retrieve all required information.To address these challenges, GraphQL was introduced in 2015 by Facebook.Unlike REST, which forces clients to retrieve ,  lets clients ask for exactly what they need—nothing more, nothing less.With a REST API, if you need a user details, user profile details along with their recent posts, you might have to  to different endpoints: → fetch user detailsGET /api/users/123/profile → fetch user profile → fetch user’s postsWith GraphQL, you can combine those requests into one and fetch exactly the data you need in a single query:The server responds with only the requested fields, reducing unnecessary data transfer and improving efficiency.However, GraphQL also comes with trade-offs—it requires more processing on the server side and isn’t as easy to cache as REST.Learn more about REST vs GraphQL here:When a client makes a request, they usually want to .But this brings up another question—where is the actual data stored?If our application deals with , we could store it .But modern applications handle —far more than what memory can efficiently handle.That’s why we need a dedicated server for storing and managing data—a .A database is the backbone of any application.It ensures that data is stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently while keeping it secure, consistent, and durable.When a client requests to  or  data, the server communicates with the database, fetches the required information, and returns it to the client.But not all databases are the same. Different applications have different scalability, performance, and consistency requirements, which is choosing the right type of database is important.If you want to learn about different types of databases, checkout this article:In system design, we typically choose between .SQL databases store data in tables with a  and follow the . - A transaction is  (it either completes fully or not at all). – Data always remains  and follows defined rules. – Transactions  with each other. – Once data is saved, it , even if the system crashes.Because of these guarantees, SQL databases are ideal for applications that require strong consistency and structured relationships, such as .Examples of popular SQL databases include: MySQL and PostgreSQLNoSQL databases on the other hand are designed for high scalability and performance.They don’t require a fixed schema and use different data models, including: – Fast lookups for simple key-value pairs (e.g., Redis). – Store flexible, JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB). – Best for highly connected data (e.g., Neo4j). – Optimized for large-scale, distributed data (e.g., Cassandra).So, which one should you use? It depends on the system requirements.If you need structured, relational data with strong consistency → If you need high scalability, flexible schemas, or fast reads/writes at scale → NoSQL is a better choice.Many modern applications use both SQL and NoSQL together.For example, an e-commerce platform might:Store customer orders in SQL (because they require strict consistency).and store Product recommendations in NoSQL (because they need flexible and fast lookups).If you want to learn more about SQL vs NoSQL, checkout this article:As our , so does the number of requests hitting our application servers.Initially, a  might be enough to handle the load. But, as traffic increases, that single server can become a bottleneck, slowing everything down.One of the quickest solutions is to upgrade the existing server by adding more CPU, RAM or storage.This approach is called Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)—making a single machine more powerful.But there are some major limitations with this approach: You can’t keep upgrading a server forever. Every machine has a maximum capacity. More powerful servers become exponentially more expensive.Single Point of Failure (SPOF) if this one server crashes, the entire system .So, while vertical scaling is a quick fix, it’s not a long-term solution for handling high traffic and ensuring system reliability.Lets look at a better approach—one that makes our system more scalable and fault tolerant.Instead of upgrading a single server, what if we  to share the load?This approach is called Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)—where we distribute the workload across multiple machines.This approach is better because:More servers = More capacity → The system can handle increasing traffic more effectively.No Single Point of Failure → If one server goes down, others can , improving reliability.Instead of investing in a single, super-expensive machine, we can use multiple affordable ones.But horizontal scaling introduces a new challenge: how do clients know which server to connect to?This is where a  comes in.A  sits between  and , acting as a  that distributes requests across multiple servers.If one server crashes, the Load Balancer automatically redirects traffic to another healthy server.But how does a Load Balancer decide which server should handle the next request?It uses Load Balancing algorithms, such as: Requests are sent to servers sequentially, one after another in a loop. Requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections. Requests from the same IP address always go to the , which helps with Learn more about load balancing algorithms here:So far, we’ve talked about scaling our application servers, but as traffic grows, the volume of data also increases.At first, we can scale a database  by adding more CPU, RAM, and storage, but there’s a limit to how much a single machine can handle.So, let’s explore other database scaling techniques that help manage large volumes of data efficiently.One of the quickest and most effective ways to speed up database  is .Think of it like the index page at the back of a book—instead of flipping through every page, you jump directly to the relevant section.A  works the same way. It’s is a super-efficient lookup table that helps the database quickly locate the required data without scanning the entire table.An index stores column values along with pointers to the actual data rows in the table.Indexes are typically created on columns that are frequently queried, such as:Columns used in WHERE conditionsBut be careful—while indexes speed up reads, they slow down writes (, , ) since the index needs to be updated whenever data changes.That’s why we should only index the most frequently accessed columns.Learn more about Database Indexes here:Indexing significantly improves , but what if even indexing isn’t enough, and our database can’t handle the growing number of read requests?That’s where our next database scaling technique  comes in.Just like we added more application servers to handle traffic, we can scale our database by creating of it across multiple servers.We have  (also called the ) that handles all  (, , ).We have  that handle .Whenever data is written to the primary database, it gets copied to the read replicas so that they stay in sync.Replication improves the read performance since read requests are spread across multiple replicas, reducing the load on each one.This also improves availability since if the primary replica fails, a read replica can take over as the new primary.Replication is great for scaling read heavy applications, but what if we need to scale writes or store huge amounts of data?Let’s say our service now has and our database has grown to.A  will eventually struggle to handle all this data efficiently.Instead of keeping everything in one place, we split the database into smaller, more manageable pieces and distribute them across .This technique is called .We divide the database into smaller parts called .Each  of the total data.Data is distributed based on a  (e.g., ).By distributing data this way, we: → Each shard handles  of queries.Speed up read and write performance → Queries are distributed across multiple shards instead of hitting a single database.Sharding is also referred to as horizontal partitioning since it splits data by rows.If you want to learn more about Sharding, checkout this article:But what if the issue isn’t the number of rows, but rather the number of columns?In such cases, we use , where we split the database by columns. Let’s explore that next.18. Vertical PartitioningImagine we have a  that stores:profile details (name, email, profile picture)login history (last_login, IP addresses)and billing information (billing address, payment details)As this table , queries become  because the database must scan  even when a request only needs a To optimize this, we use Vertical Partitioning where we split user table into smaller, more focused tables based on usage patterns. → Stores name, email, profile picture. → Stores login timestamps. → Stores billing address, payment details.This improves  since each request only scans  instead of the entire .It reduces , making data retrieval quicker.However, no matter how much we optimize the database, retrieving data from disk is always slower than retrieving from memory.What if we could store frequently accessed data in memory for lightning-fast access? is used to optimize the performance of a system by storing frequently accessed data in memory instead of repeatedly fetching it from the database.One of the most common caching strategies is the When a user , the application first check the .If the data is , it’s returned instantly, avoiding a database call.If the data , the application retrieves it from the database, stores it in the cache for future requests, and returns it to the user.Next time, the same data is requested, it’s served , making the request much faster.To prevent outdated data from being served, we use —an expiration time set on cached data so it gets  after a certain period.Popular caching tools include If you want to learn more about caching strategies, check out this article:Lets look at the next database scaling technique.Most relational databases use  to store data efficiently by breaking it into separate tables.For example, in an e-commerce system:The  stores user details.The  stores their orders.The  stores product details.While this , it also When retrieving data from multiple tables, the database must combine them using JOIN operations, which can slow down queries as the dataset grows.SELECT o.order_id, u.name, u.email, o.product, o.amount
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.user_id; reduces the number of joins by combining related data into a single table, even if it means some data gets duplicated. Instead of keeping and in separate tables, we create  table that stores user details along with their latest orders.Now, when retrieving a user’s order history, we don’t need a —the data is already stored together leading to faster queries and better read performance.SELECT order_id, user_name AS name, user_email AS email, product, amount
FROM orders;Denormalization is often used in read-heavy applications where speed is more critical but the downside is it leads to  and more .As we scale our system across multiple servers, databases, and data centers, we enter the world of .One of the fundamental principles of distributed systems is the , which states that: No distributed system can achieve all three of the following at the same time: Every node always returns the . The system  to requests, even if some nodes are down (but the data may not be the latest). The system continues operating even if there’s a  between nodes.Since network failures (P) are inevitable, we must choose between:Consistency + Partition Tolerance (CP) → Ensures every request gets the latest data but may reject requests during failures. Example: .Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP) → Ensures the system always responds, even if some data is stale. Example: NoSQL databases like Cassandra and DynamoDB.To learn more about CAP theorem, check out this article:In distributed NoSQL databases, achieving  across all servers .Instead, we use —which means:Not all nodes are updated instantly, but given enough time, they  sync and return the same data.This allows the system to remain highly available and fast, even under extreme loads.How Eventual Consistency Works:A user updates data in  of the database.The system  acknowledges the update, ensuring .The update is then propagated asynchronously to other replicas.After a short delay, all replicas have the latest data, ensuring .Most modern applications don’t just store text records, they also need to handle , ,  and other .But here’s the problem: Traditional databases are not designed to store large, unstructured files efficiently.We use Blob Storage like Amazon S3—a highly scalable and cost-effective way to store large, unstructured files in the cloud.Blobs are the individual files like images, videos or documents.These blobs are stored inside logical containers or buckets in the cloud.Each file gets a , making it easy to retrieve and serve over the web. https://my-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/tutorial.mp4There are several advantages with using blob storage like: → It can store petabytes of data effortlessly. → You only pay for storage and retrieval that you actually use. → Data is copied across multiple data centers and availability zones for durability. → Files can be retrieved using REST APIs or direct URLs.A common use case is to stream audio or video files to user application in real-time.But streaming directly from blob-storage can be slow, especially if the data is stored in a .For example, imagine you’re in  trying to watch a YouTube video that’s hosted on a server in .Since the video data has to , this could lead to buffering and slow load times.A Content Delivery Network (or CDN) solves this problem by delivering

users based on their .Instead of serving content from a , a CDN  on multiple edge servers located worldwide.When a user requests content, the  delivers it instead of reaching all the way to the .Since

dashboards and online multiplayer games.With HTTP, the only way to get real-time updates is through —sending repeated requests every few seconds.But polling is inefficient because it increases server load and wastes bandwidth, as  (when there’s no new data).WebSockets solve this problem by allowing continuous, two-way communication between the  over a single persistent connection.Here is how WebSockets work:The client initiates a WebSocket connection with the server.Once established, the connection .The server can push updates to the client , without waiting for a request.The client can also send messages This enables real-time interactions and eliminates the need for polling.To learn more about WebSockets, check out this article:WebSockets enable real-time communication between a client and a server, but what if a server needs to notify another server when an event occurs?When a user makes a payment, Stripe needs to notify your application .If someone pushes code to GitHub, a

Three security bypasses have been discovered in Ubuntu Linux's unprivileged user namespace restrictions, which could be enable a local attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in kernel components. The issues allow local unprivileged users to create user namespaces with full administrative capabilities and impact Ubuntu versions 23.10, where unprivileged user namespaces restrictions are enabled, and 24.04 which has them active by default... 

Ubuntu added AppArmor-based restrictions in version 23.10 and enabled them by default in 24.04 to limit the risk of namespace misuse. Researchers at cloud security and compliance company Qualys found that these restrictions can be bypassed in three different ways... The researchers note that these bypasses are dangerous when combined with kernel-related vulnerabilities, and they are not enough to obtain complete control of the system... Qualys notified the Ubuntu security team of their findings on January 15 and agreed to a coordinated release. However, the busybox bypass was discovered independently by vulnerability researcher Roddux, who published the details on March 21. 


Canonical, the organization behind Ubuntu Linux, has acknowledged Qualys' findings and confirmed to BleepingComputer that they are developing improvements to the AppArmor protections. A spokesperson told us that they are not treating these findings as vulnerabilities per se but as limitations of a defense-in-depth mechanism. Hence, protections will be released according to standard release schedules and not as urgent security fixes.
 

Canonical shared hardening steps that administrators should consider in a bulletin published on their official "Ubuntu Discourse" discussion forum.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What could possibly go wrong?

Or perhaps using specialized cameras sensitive enough to distinguish subtle color variations in paint that look just right under specific lighting. Scientists and engineers do this every day—and the resulting data files are so large, they're drowning in it.A new compression format called Spectral JPEG XL might finally solve this growing problem in scientific visualization and computer graphics. Researchers Alban Fichet and Christoph Peters of Intel Corporation detailed the format in a recent paper published in the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques (JCGT). It tackles a serious bottleneck for industries working with these specialized images. These spectral files can contain 30, 100, or more data points per pixel, causing file sizes to balloon into multi-gigabyte territory—making them unwieldy to store and analyze.When we think of digital images, we typically imagine files that store just three colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). This works well for everyday photos, but capturing the true color and behavior of light requires much more detail. Spectral images aim for this higher fidelity by recording light's intensity not just in broad RGB categories, but across dozens or even hundreds of narrow, specific wavelength bands. This detailed information primarily spans the visible spectrum and often extends into near-infrared and near-ultraviolet regions crucial for simulating how materials interact with light accurately.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why NASA Is Conducting Bizarre Experiments on the ISS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DBxZvtMYm4</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/3DBxZvtMYm4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:32:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Visit https://strawberry.me/astrumspace today and start coaching with a $50 credit.

--

Of all Shakespeare’s plays, perhaps none is stranger than “Macbeth”— a parable on power rife with supernatural elements. But according to texts from the 11th century, this tragedy has its roots in reality. What’s more, other accounts mention witches, prophecies, and arboreal armies. Which raises the question: just how much of Shakespeare’s strange story is true? Benjamin Hudson investigates.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.January 2023 - London, United Kingdom.A student named Kenji is on a tourist visit.Yet he spends so much time waiting in queue to buy tickets for the underground train.He hears about the tap & pay service called Apple Pay from the station officer.Although doubtful about its safety, he decides to try it.Transitioning to microservices is tough. It’s not just a technical shift, but an organizational one too.From defining service boundaries to managing decentralized data and handling interservice communication, many things can go wrong.This 80+ page ebook breaks down common migration challenges with examples from dev teams at Uber, Spotify & Netflix, helping you understand the obstacles before you hit them.Here’s a simplified version of Apple Pay architecture:Chapter 1: A Credit Card, a Wallet, and an iPhoneKenji enters his credit card details into the Apple Wallet.Yet Apple doesn’t store it on the iPhone or Apple servers.Instead they send credit card details and iPhone metadata to the payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, in encrypted form.The iPhone metadata includes its model number and secure element ID. Imagine the  as a unique number assigned to each iPhone.The payment network verifies the credit card details and generates a device account number (). Think of DAN as a unique random number representing the credit card number, but irreversible.Also the to each credit card and iPhone.The payment network sends DAN to the iPhone in encrypted form. And the iPhone stores it inside the , a highly specialized chip, so nobody can access it. Besides Apple servers don’t store DAN for security and privacy.While the payment network keeps a copy of the DAN, credit card details, and iPhone metadata.Chapter 2: A Single Tap to Open the GateKenji has no internet connection due to roaming.Yet he taps his iPhone on the card reader at the train station gate.The iPhone communicates with the card reader via near-field communication (). Consider NFC as a short-range, wireless communication standard.The card reader creates a transaction record, which contains details such as the payment amount and date.The card reader then sends these details to the iPhone via NFC.Yet Apple Pay must validate the transaction by checking Kenji’s involvement in it. So they ask for his biometric information, such as a touch ID or face ID. They don’t store the biometric information on Apple servers, but only on the secure enclave in the iPhone. Imagine the  as a separate processor inside the iPhone, isolated from the rest of the system.The secure enclave fetches the encrypted biometric information when Kenji places his finger on the touch ID. It confirms his identity by comparing the data with the stored biometric information.This approach ensures biometric information never leaves the iPhone.Chapter 3: No Credit Card, No Cash, No ProblemThe secure enclave confirms Kenji’s identity and signals the secure element.Think of the  as a highly specialized chip in the iPhone. It combines DAN and transaction details to create a unique cryptogram. This is called the .Imagine the  as a time-based, single-use password to prove a transaction’s legitimacy.The iPhone sends an authorization request to the payment network. It contains the request cryptogram and transaction details. Put simply, DAN never leaves the iPhone for security.The payment network regenerates the request cryptogram by combining the transaction details and DAN copy. A payment is valid only if the cryptogram values are equal.Chapter 4: The Problem With Contactless PaymentYet the train station keeps Kenji's gate closed until his payment gets confirmed.So the payment network creates a response code, a number representing the payment status. Then combines it with the DAN and the request cryptogram to create a new cryptogram. This is called the .The payment network sends a response to the card reader. It includes only the response code and response cryptogram. Put simply, doesn’t send DAN and request cryptogram.The iPhone regenerates the response cryptogram using the request cryptogram, DAN, and response code. The card reader considers a payment network authentic only if cryptogram values are equal. While the response code represents the payment status.A credit card displays sensitive information, so there’s a risk of information misuse. But Apple Pay is safer as it doesn’t show credit card information to anyone.Apple Pay relies on the EMV contactless payment specification as part of its security model. Think of  as a chip-based card payment authentication mechanism.While Kenji visited the main tourist sights in London and happily returned home.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in a few months.Yet it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

But over the years, Kafka has evolved far beyond that initial use case.Today, Kafka is a powerful, distributed event streaming platform used by companies across every industry—from tech giants like Netflix and Uber to banks, retailers, and IoT platforms.Its core architecture, based on immutable append-only logs, , and , makes it incredibly scalable, fault-tolerant, and versatile.In this article, we’ll explore the 10 powerful use cases of Kafka with real-world examples.In modern distributed applications, logs and metrics are generated across hundreds or even thousands of servers, containers, and applications. These logs need to be collected for monitoring, debugging, and security auditing.Traditionally, logs were stored locally on servers, making it difficult to search, correlate, and analyze system-wide events.Kafka solves this by acting as a , enabling fault-tolerant, scalable, and high-throughput pipeline for log collection processing.Instead of sending logs directly to a storage system, applications and logging agents stream log events to Kafka topics. Kafka provides a durable buffer that absorbs spikes in log volumes while decoupling producers and consumers.Kafka Log Aggregation PipelineStep 1: Applications Send Logs to Kafka (Producers)Each microservice, web server, or application container generates logs in real time and sends them to Kafka via lightweight log forwarders (log agents) like: Fluentd, Logstash or Filebeat.These tools publish logs to specific Kafka topics (e.g., , ).Step 2: Kafka Brokers Store LogsKafka acts as the central, durable and distributed log store, providing: - logs are replicated across multiple brokers  - logs are stored on disk for configurable retention periods Kafka can handle logs from thousands of sourcesStep 3: Consumers Process LogsLog consumers (like Elasticsearch, Hadoop, or cloud storage systems) read data from Kafka and process it for:for searching and filtering logslong-term archiving in S3, HDFS, or object storagetrigger alerts based on log patternsStep 4: Visualization and AlertingProcessed logs are visualized and monitored using tools like:  - for dashboards and visualization - for real-time alerting  - for advanced log analysis and security insightsChange Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to track changes in a database (inserts, updates, deletes) and stream those changes in real time to downstream systems.Modern architectures rely on multiple systems—search engines, caches, data lakes, microservices—all of which need . Traditional  are slow, introduce latency, and often lead to: in search indexes and analytics dashboards when syncing multiple systems due to frequent pollingKafka provides a high-throughput, real-time event pipeline that captures and distributes changes from a source database to multiple consumers—ensuring low latency and consistency across systems.Step 1: Capture Changes from the DatabaseTools like , , or  read the database transaction logs (binlogs, WALs) to detect: INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEsEach change is transformed into a structured event and published to a Kafka topic.Step 2: Stream Events via KafkaKafka topics act as an , providing: — All changes are stored reliably — Events for a given key (e.g., primary key) are strictly ordered — Thousands of events per second per partitionStep 3: Distribute to Real-Time ConsumersMultiple consumers can subscribe to the change events for various use cases: → Sync changes to Elasticsearch / OpenSearch → Update  for fast reads → Stream into BigQuery / Snowflake / Redshift]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux Kernel 6.14 Is a Big Leap Forward In Performance, Windows Compatibility</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/03/26/2110211/linux-kernel-614-is-a-big-leap-forward-in-performance-windows-compatibility?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet, written by Steven Vaughan-Nichols: Despite the minor delay, Linux 6.14 arrives packed with cutting-edge features and improvements to power upcoming Linux distributions, such as the forthcoming Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora 42. The big news for desktop users is the improved NTSYNC driver, especially those who like to play Windows games or run Windows programs on Linux. This driver is designed to emulate Windows NT synchronization primitives. What that feature means for you and me is that it will significantly improve the performance of Windows programs running on Wine and Steam Play. [...] Gamers always want the best possible graphics performance, so they'll also be happy to see that Linux now supports recently launched AMD RDNA 4 graphics cards. This approach includes support for the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. Combine this support with the recently improved open-source RADV driver and AMD gamers should see the best speed yet on their gaming rigs.
 
Of course, the release is not just for gamers. Linux 6.14 also includes several AMD and Intel processor enhancements. These boosts focus on power management, thermal control, and compute performance optimizations. These updates are expected to improve overall system efficiency and performance. This release also comes with the AMDXDNA driver, which provides official support for AMD's neural processing units based on the XDNA architecture. This integration enables efficient execution of AI workloads, such as convolutional neural networks and large language models, directly on supported AMD hardware. While Rust has faced some difficulties in recent months in Linux, more Rust programming language abstractions have been integrated into the kernel, laying the groundwork for future drivers written in Rust. [...] Besides drivers, Miguel Ojeda, Rust for Linux's lead developer, said recently that the introduction of the macro for smart pointers with Rust 1.84: derive(CoercePointee) is an "important milestone on the way to building a kernel that only uses stable Rust functions." This approach will also make integrating C and Rust code easier. We're getting much closer to Rust being grafted into Linux's tree.
 
In addition, Linux 6.14 supports Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor, enhancing performance and stability for devices powered by this chipset. That support means you can expect to see much faster Android-based smartphones later this year. This release includes a patch for the so-called GhostWrite vulnerability, which can be used to root some RISC-V processors. This fix will block such attacks. Additionally, Linux 6.14 includes improvements for the copy-on-write Btrfs file system/logical volume manager. These primarily read-balancing methods offer flexibility for different RAID hardware configurations and workloads. Additionally, support for uncached buffered I/O optimizes memory usage on systems with fast storage devices. Linux 6.14 is available for download here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What a crab sees before a cuttlefish eats it</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nhFyf-vPus</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_nhFyf-vPus?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 20:05:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scientists have a new theory about the unique form of camouflage in cuttlefish.

Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced to improve the overall health of the project. This blog post outlines some planned changes for the v1.33 release, which the release team believes you should be aware of to ensure the continued smooth operation of your Kubernetes environment and to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The information below is based on the current status of the v1.33 release and is subject to change before the final release date.The Kubernetes API removal and deprecation processThe Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release. It will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes.Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after the deprecation.Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice; this process can become a withdrawal in cases where a different implementation for the same feature is already in place.Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable, or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the deprecation guide.Deprecations and removals for Kubernetes v1.33Deprecation of the stable Endpoints APIThe EndpointSlices API has been stable since v1.21, which effectively replaced the original Endpoints API. While the original Endpoints API was simple and straightforward, it also posed some challenges when scaling to large numbers of network endpoints. The EndpointSlices API has introduced new features such as dual-stack networking, making the original Endpoints API ready for deprecation.This deprecation only impacts those who use the Endpoints API directly from workloads or scripts; these users should migrate to use EndpointSlices instead. There will be a dedicated blog post with more details on the deprecation implications and migration plans in the coming weeks.Following its deprecation in v1.31, as highlighted in the release announcement, the status.nodeInfo.kubeProxyVersion field will be removed in v1.33. This field was set by kubelet, but its value was not consistently accurate. As it has been disabled by default since v1.31, the v1.33 release will remove this field entirely.Removal of host network support for Windows podsWindows Pod networking aimed to achieve feature parity with Linux and provide better cluster density by allowing containers to use the Node’s networking namespace.
The original implementation landed as alpha with v1.26, but as it faced unexpected containerd behaviours,
and alternative solutions were available, the Kubernetes project has decided to withdraw the associated
KEP. We're expecting to see support fully removed in v1.33.Featured improvement of Kubernetes v1.33As authors of this article, we picked one improvement as the most significant change to call out!Support for user namespaces within Linux PodsOne of the oldest open KEPs today is KEP-127, Pod security improvement by using Linux User namespaces for Pods. This KEP was first opened in late 2016, and after multiple iterations, had its alpha release in v1.25, initial beta in v1.30 (where it was disabled by default), and now is set to be a part of v1.33, where the feature is available by default.This support will not impact existing Pods unless you manually specify  to opt in. As highlighted in the v1.30 sneak peek blog, this is an important milestone for mitigating vulnerabilities.Selected other Kubernetes v1.33 improvementsThe following list of enhancements is likely to be included in the upcoming v1.33 release. This is not a commitment and the release content is subject to change.In-place resource resize for vertical scaling of PodsWhen provisioning a Pod, you can use various resources such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc. Scalability requirements may need horizontal scaling by updating the Pod replica count, or vertical scaling by updating resources allocated to Pod’s container(s). Before this enhancement, container resources defined in a Pod's  were immutable, and updating any of these details within a Pod template would trigger Pod replacement.But what if you could dynamically update the resource configuration for your existing Pods without restarting them?The KEP-1287 is precisely to allow such in-place Pod updates. It opens up various possibilities of vertical scale-up for stateful processes without any downtime, seamless scale-down when the traffic is low, and even allocating larger resources during startup that is eventually reduced once the initial setup is complete. This was released as alpha in v1.27, and is expected to land as beta in v1.33.DRA’s ResourceClaim Device Status graduates to betaThe  field in ResourceClaim , originally introduced in the v1.32 release, is likely to graduate to beta in v1.33. This field allows drivers to report device status data, improving both observability and troubleshooting capabilities.For example, reporting the interface name, MAC address, and IP addresses of network interfaces in the status of a ResourceClaim can significantly help in configuring and managing network services, as well as in debugging network related issues. You can read more about ResourceClaim Device Status in Dynamic Resource Allocation: ResourceClaim Device Status document.Ordered namespace deletionThis KEP introduces a more structured deletion process for Kubernetes namespaces to ensure secure and deterministic resource removal. The current semi-random deletion order can create security gaps or unintended behaviour, such as Pods persisting after their associated NetworkPolicies are deleted. By enforcing a structured deletion sequence that respects logical and security dependencies, this approach ensures Pods are removed before other resources. The design improves Kubernetes’s security and reliability by mitigating risks associated with non-deterministic deletions.Enhancements for indexed job managementThese two KEPs are both set to graduate to GA to provide better reliability for job handling, specifically for indexed jobs. KEP-3850 provides per-index backoff limits for indexed jobs, which allows each index to be fully independent of other indexes. Also, KEP-3998 extends Job API to define conditions for making an indexed job as successfully completed when not all indexes are succeeded.New features and deprecations are also announced in the Kubernetes release notes. We will formally announce what's new in Kubernetes v1.33 as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.Kubernetes v1.33 release is planned for Wednesday, 23rd April, 2025.

FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigate how an online network known as the Terrorgram Collective grew and operated and what its rise and fall tell us about the evolution of far-right extremism on loosely-moderated tech platforms.

“The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram” traces how various loosely-moderated platforms, from 4chan to 8chan to eventually Telegram, have become havens for extremist ideas and for radicalization. The investigation shows how a number of attackers around the world — from Slovakia to New Zealand to the United States — used these various platforms and were encouraged by them.

“Drawing on a trove of archived posts, our reporting shows how Telegram and other lightly regulated platforms became a gathering place for ‘militant accelerationists’ — neo-Nazis who want to use terror and violence to bring down governments and create new, white ethnostates,” says A.C. Thompson, who has been reporting on the evolution of violent extremism in the U.S. for years.

The film also probes how authorities in several countries would eventually arrest around a dozen people allegedly tied to the Terrorgram Collective, a transnational virtual network of extremists accused of inciting acts of white supremacist terrorism. The U.S. government would charge two Americans with a slew of felonies, including soliciting the murder of government officials on Telegram. Telegram says it has always screened postings for problematic content and that, “Calls for violence from any group are not tolerated on our platform.”

“The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram” is a FRONTLINE production with 2over10 Media in association with ProPublica. The directors are Thomas Jennings and Annie Wong. The producers are Annie Wong, Thomas Jennings and A.C. Thompson. The writers are Thomas Jennings and A.C. Thompson. The co-producers are Karina Meier and Fanny Lee. The correspondents are A.C.

      Robert Griesemer
      26 March 2025
      The Go 1.18 release introduced generics and with that a number of new features, including type parameters, type constraints, and new concepts such as type sets.
It also introduced the notion of a .
While the former provide concrete new functionality, a core type is an abstract construct that was introduced
for expediency and to simplify dealing with generic operands (operands whose types are type parameters).
In the Go compiler, code that in the past relied on the underlying type of an operand,
now instead had to call a function computing the operand’s core type.
In the language spec, in many places we just needed to replace “underlying type” with “core type”.
What’s not to like?Quite a few things, as it turns out!
To understand how we got here, it’s useful to briefly revisit how type parameters and type constraints work.Type parameters and type constraintsA type parameter is a placeholder for a future type argument;
it acts like a  whose value is known at compile time,
similar to how a named constant stands for a number, string, or bool whose value is known at compile time.
Like ordinary variables, type parameters have a type.
That type is described by their  which determines
what operations are permitted on operands whose type is the respective type parameter.Any concrete type that instantiates a type parameter must satisfy the type parameter’s constraint.
This ensures that an operand whose type is a type parameter possesses all of the respective type constraint’s properties,
no matter what concrete type is used to instantiate the type parameter.In Go, type constraints are described through a mixture of method and type requirements which together
define a : this is the set of all the types that satisfy all the requirements. Go uses a
generalized form of interfaces for this purpose. An interface enumerates a set of methods and types,
and the type set described by such an interface consists of all the types that implement those methods
and that are included in the enumerated types.For instance, the type set described by the interfacetype Constraint interface {
    ~[]byte | ~string
    Hash() uint64
}
consists of all the types whose representation is  or  and whose method set includes the  method.With this we can now write down the rules that govern operations on generic operands.
For instance, the rules for index expressions state that (among other things)
for an operand  of type parameter type :The index expression  must be valid for values of all types in ’s type set.
The element types of all types in ’s type set must be identical.
(In this context, the element type of a string type is .)These rules make it possible to index the generic variable  below (playground):func at[bytestring Constraint](s bytestring, i int) byte {
    return s[i]
}
The indexing operation  is permitted because the type of  is , and the type constraint (type set) of
 contains  and  types for which indexing with  is valid.This type set-based approach is very flexible and in line with the intentions of the
original generics proposal:
an operation involving operands of generic type should be valid if it is valid for any type permitted by the respective
type constraint.
To simplify matters with respect to the implementation, knowing that we would be able to relax rules later,
this approach was  chosen universally.
Instead, for instance, for Send statements, the spec states thatThe channel expression’s  must be a channel, the channel direction must permit send operations,
and the type of the value to be sent must be assignable to the channel’s element type.These rules are based on the notion of a core type which is defined roughly as follows:If a type is not a type parameter, its core type is just its underlying type.If the type is a type parameter, the core type is the single underlying type of all the types in the type parameter’s type set.
If the type set has  underlying types, the core type doesn’t exist.For instance,  has a core type (), but the  interface above does not have a core type.
To make things more complicated, when it comes to channel operations and certain built-in calls (, ) the above definition
of core types is too restrictive.
The actual rules have adjustments that allow for differing channel directions and type sets containing both  and  types.There are various problems with this approach:Because the definition of core type must lead to sound type rules for different language features,
it is overly restrictive for specific operations.
For instance, the Go 1.24 rules for slice expressions do rely on core types,
and as a consequence slicing an operand of type  constrained by  is not permitted, even though
it could be valid.When trying to understand a specific language feature, one may have to learn the intricacies of
core types even when considering non-generic code.
Again, for slice expressions, the language spec talks about the core type of the sliced operand,
rather than just stating that the operand must be an array, slice, or string.
The latter is more direct, simpler, and clearer, and doesn’t require knowing another concept that may be
irrelevant in the concrete case.Because the notion of core types exists, the rules for index expressions, and  and  (and others),
which all eschew core types, appear as exceptions in the language rather than the norm.
In turn, core types cause proposals such as issue #48522 which would permit a selector
 to access a field  shared by all elements of ’s type set, to appear to add more exceptions to the
language.
Without core types, that feature becomes a natural and useful consequence of the ordinary rules for non-generic
field access.For the upcoming Go 1.25 release (August 2025) we decided to remove the notion of core types from the
language spec in favor of explicit (and equivalent!) prose where needed.
This has multiple benefits:The Go spec presents fewer concepts, making it easier to learn the language.The behavior of non-generic code can be understood without reference to generics concepts.The individualized approach (specific rules for specific operations) opens the door for more flexible rules.
We already mentioned issue #48522, but there are also ideas for more powerful
slice operations, and improved type inference.The respective proposal issue #70128 was recently approved and the relevant changes
are already implemented.
Concretely this means that a lot of prose in the language spec was reverted to its original,
pre-generics form, and new paragraphs were added where needed to explain the rules as they
pertain to generic operands. Importantly, no behavior was changed.
The entire section on core types was removed.
The compiler’s error messages were updated to not mention “core type” anymore, and in many
cases error messages are now more specific by pointing out exactly which type in a type set
is causing a problem.Here is a sample of the changes made. For the built-in function ,
starting with Go 1.18 the spec began as follows:For an argument  with core type that is a channel,
the built-in function  records that no more values will be sent on the channel.A reader who simply wanted to know how  works, had to first learn about core types.
Starting with Go 1.25, this section will again begin the same way it began before Go 1.18:For a channel , the built-in function 
records that no more values will be sent on the channel.This is shorter and easier to understand.
Only when the reader is dealing with a generic operand will they have to contemplate
the newly added paragraph:If the type of the argument to  is a type parameter
all types in its type set must be channels with the same element type.
It is an error if any of those channels is a receive-only channel.We made similar changes to each place that mentioned core types.
In summary, although this spec update does not affect any current Go program, it opens the
door to future language improvements while making the language as it is today easier to
learn and its spec simpler.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson: Politics, Trump, AOC, Elon &amp; DOGE | Lex Fridman Podcast #462</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTPSeeKokdo</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DTPSeeKokdo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 22:05:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ezra Klein is one of the most influential voices representing the left-wing of American politics.

The comparison has been a popular one, but the developers wanted to make it clear that this new IP from the creators of Sniper Elite is "its own thing for sure," and they're right. It is. But there are times when the similarities jump off the screen. Both focus on a post-apocalyptic world full of mutants, warring factions, and--most relatable of all--they both feature a sprawling locked bunker at the heart of their stories. But where the inciting incident in most Fallout games is  that bunker, Atomfall asks you to get inside its mysterious facility, The Interchange. It's in that simply stated objective that Atomfall's open-ended world design elevates the game to be something different and interesting in its own right, even as things like stealth and combat drag it down at times.Just as Atomfall's major brushstrokes are derivative of Fallout and other post-apocalyptic fiction, its story starts with a similar penchant for the cliche. You awaken as an amnesiac in a 1950s-set British countryside. A nearby phone booth rings, and the voice on the other side demands you destroy someone or something called "Oberon." That same voice will call back nearly each time you approach a phone booth in the wild. The cryptic messages don't make a bit of sense, but it does swiftly push you toward your objective: Find and get inside The Interchange, a locked-down facility of some sort that seems to have been the site of a science experiment gone wrong. In there, Oberon can perish, if you so choose.The region's people have been left to put the pieces back together following this event, and it's resulted in the forming of several opposing groups, such as the military force that claims authority, roaming bandits who use the chaos as an invitation to resort to lawlessness, and a cult of pagans who believe the catastrophe was . These territorial factions are often isolated to their own regions, which are experienced as a series of open-world maps that can be explored without limitations as soon as you start the game.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fresh Swap Features for Linux Users in Kubernetes 1.32</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/03/25/swap-linux-improvements/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Dev - Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Swap is a fundamental and an invaluable Linux feature.
It offers numerous benefits, such as effectively increasing a node’s memory by
swapping out unused data,
shielding nodes from system-level memory spikes,
preventing Pods from crashing when they hit their memory limits,
and much more.
As a result, the node special interest group within the Kubernetes project
has invested significant effort into supporting swap on Linux nodes.The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support
for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.
Later, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many
new improvements.
In the following Kubernetes releases more improvements were made, paving the way
to GA in the near future.Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.
This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization
when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial
design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory
was detected on a node.In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage.
This provided Linux users the opportunity to experiment with the swap feature for the first time.
However, as an Alpha version, it was not fully developed and only partially worked on limited environments.In version 1.28 swap support on Linux nodes was promoted to Beta.
The Beta version was a drastic leap forward.
Not only did it fix a large amount of bugs and made swap work in a stable way,
but it also brought cgroup v2 support, introduced a wide variety of tests
which include complex scenarios such as node-level pressure, and more.
It also brought many exciting new capabilities such as the  behavior
which sets an auto-calculated swap limit to containers, OpenMetrics instrumentation
support (through the  endpoint) and Summary API for
VerticalPodAutoscalers (through the  endpoint), and more.Today we are working on more improvements, paving the way for GA.
Currently, the focus is especially towards ensuring node stability,
enhanced debug abilities, addressing user feedback,
polishing the feature and making it stable.
For example, in order to increase stability, containers in high-priority pods
cannot access swap which ensures the memory they need is ready to use.
In addition, the  behavior was removed since it might compromise
the node's health.
Secret content protection against swapping has also been introduced
(see relevant security-risk section for more info).To conclude, compared to previous releases, the kubelet's support for running with swap enabled
is more stable and robust, more user-friendly, and addresses many known shortcomings.
That said, the NodeSwap feature introduces basic swap support, and this is just the beginning.
In the near future, additional features are planned to enhance swap functionality in various ways,
such as improving evictions, extending the API, increasing customizability, and more!In order for the kubelet to initialize on a swap-enabled node, the 
field must be set to  on kubelet's configuration setting, or the deprecated
 command line flag must be deactivated.It is possible to configure the  option to define the
manner in which a node utilizes swap memory.
For instance,The currently available configuration options for  are: (default): Kubernetes workloads cannot use swap. However, processes
outside of Kubernetes' scope, like system daemons (such as kubelet itself!) can utilize swap.
This behavior is beneficial for protecting the node from system-level memory spikes,
but it does not safeguard the workloads themselves from such spikes.: Kubernetes workloads can utilize swap memory, but with certain limitations.
The amount of swap available to a Pod is determined automatically,
based on the proportion of the memory requested relative to the node's total memory.
Only non-high-priority Pods under the Burstable
Quality of Service (QoS) tier are permitted to use swap.
For more details, see the section below.If configuration for  is not specified,
by default the kubelet will apply the same behaviour as the  setting.On Linux nodes, Kubernetes only supports running with swap enabled for hosts that use cgroup v2.
On cgroup v1 systems, all Kubernetes workloads are not allowed to use swap memory.Install a swap-enabled cluster with kubeadmIt is required for this demo that the kubeadm tool be installed, following the steps outlined in the
kubeadm installation guide.
If swap is already enabled on the node, cluster creation may proceed.
If swap is not enabled, please refer to the provided instructions for enabling swap.Create a swap file and turn swap onI'll demonstrate creating 4GiB of swap, both in the encrypted and unencrypted case.Setting up unencrypted swapAn unencrypted swap file can be set up as follows.Setting up encrypted swapAn encrypted swap file can be set up as follows.
Bear in mind that this example uses the  binary (which is available
on most Linux distributions).Verify that swap is enabledSwap can be verified to be enabled with both  command or the  command> swapon -s

After setting up swap, to start the swap file at boot time,
you either set up a systemd unit to activate (encrypted) swap, or you
add a line similar to /swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0 into .Set up a Kubernetes cluster that uses swap-enabled nodesTo make things clearer, here is an example kubeadm configuration file  for the swap enabled cluster.Then create a single-node cluster using kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml.
During init, there is a warning that swap is enabled on the node and in case the kubelet
 is set to true. We plan to remove this warning in a future release.How is the swap limit being determined with LimitedSwap?The configuration of swap memory, including its limitations, presents a significant
challenge. Not only is it prone to misconfiguration, but as a system-level property, any
misconfiguration could potentially compromise the entire node rather than just a specific
workload. To mitigate this risk and ensure the health of the node, we have implemented
Swap with automatic configuration of limitations.With , Pods that do not fall under the Burstable QoS classification (i.e.
/ QoS Pods) are prohibited from utilizing swap memory.
 QoS Pods exhibit unpredictable memory consumption patterns and lack
information regarding their memory usage, making it difficult to determine a safe
allocation of swap memory.
Conversely,  QoS Pods are typically employed for applications that rely on the
precise allocation of resources specified by the workload, with memory being immediately available.
To maintain the aforementioned security and node health guarantees,
these Pods are not permitted to use swap memory when  is in effect.
In addition, high-priority pods are not permitted to use swap in order to ensure the memory
they consume always residents on disk, hence ready to use.Prior to detailing the calculation of the swap limit, it is necessary to define the following terms:: The total amount of physical memory available on the node.: The total amount of swap memory on the node that is available for use by Pods (some swap memory may be reserved for system use).: The container's memory request.Swap limitation is configured as:
(containerMemoryRequest / nodeTotalMemory) × totalPodsSwapAvailableIn other words, the amount of swap that a container is able to use is proportionate to its
memory request, the node's total physical memory and the total amount of swap memory on
the node that is available for use by Pods.It is important to note that, for containers within Burstable QoS Pods, it is possible to
opt-out of swap usage by specifying memory requests that are equal to memory limits.
Containers configured in this manner will not have access to swap memory.There are a number of possible ways that one could envision swap use on a node.
When swap is already provisioned and available on a node,
the kubelet is able to be configured so that:It can start with swap on.It will direct the Container Runtime Interface to allocate zero swap memory
to Kubernetes workloads by default.Swap configuration on a node is exposed to a cluster admin via the
 in the KubeletConfiguration.
As a cluster administrator, you can specify the node's behaviour in the
presence of swap memory by setting .The kubelet employs the CRI
(container runtime interface) API, and directs the container runtime to
configure specific cgroup v2 parameters (such as ) in a manner that will
enable the desired swap configuration for a container. For runtimes that use control groups,
the container runtime is then responsible for writing these settings to the container-level cgroup.Node and container level metric statisticsKubelet now collects node and container level metric statistics,
which can be accessed at the  (which is used mainly by monitoring
tools like Prometheus) and  (which is used mainly by Autoscalers) kubelet HTTP endpoints.
This allows clients who can directly interrogate the kubelet to
monitor swap usage and remaining swap memory when using .
Additionally, a  metric has been added to cadvisor to show
the total physical swap capacity of the machine.
See this page for more info.Node Feature Discovery (NFD)Node Feature Discovery
is a Kubernetes addon for detecting hardware features and configuration.
It can be utilized to discover which nodes are provisioned with swap.As an example, to figure out which nodes are provisioned with swap,
use the following command:This will result in an output similar to:k8s-worker1: true
k8s-worker2: true
k8s-worker3: false
In this example, swap is provisioned on nodes  and , but not on .Having swap available on a system reduces predictability.
While swap can enhance performance by making more RAM available, swapping data
back to memory is a heavy operation, sometimes slower by many orders of magnitude,
which can cause unexpected performance regressions.
Furthermore, swap changes a system's behaviour under memory pressure.
Enabling swap increases the risk of noisy neighbors,
where Pods that frequently use their RAM may cause other Pods to swap.
In addition, since swap allows for greater memory usage for workloads in Kubernetes that cannot be predictably accounted for,
and due to unexpected packing configurations,
the scheduler currently does not account for swap memory usage.
This heightens the risk of noisy neighbors.The performance of a node with swap memory enabled depends on the underlying physical storage.
When swap memory is in use, performance will be significantly worse in an I/O
operations per second (IOPS) constrained environment, such as a cloud VM with
I/O throttling, when compared to faster storage mediums like solid-state drives
or NVMe.
As swap might cause IO pressure, it is recommended to give a higher IO latency
priority to system critical daemons. See the relevant section in the
recommended practices section below.On Linux nodes, memory-backed volumes (such as 
volume mounts, or  with )
are implemented with a  filesystem.
The contents of such volumes should remain in memory at all times, hence should
not be swapped to disk.
To ensure the contents of such volumes remain in memory, the  tmpfs option
is being used.The Linux kernel officially supports the  option from version 6.3 (more info
can be found in Linux Kernel Version Requirements).
However, the different distributions often choose to backport this mount option to older
Linux versions as well.In order to verify whether the node supports the  option, the kubelet will do the following:If the kernel's version is above 6.3 then the  option will be assumed to be supported.Otherwise, kubelet would try to mount a dummy tmpfs with the  option at startup.
If kubelet fails with an error indicating of an unknown option,  will be assumed
to not be supported, hence will not be used.
A kubelet log entry will be emitted to warn the user about memory-backed volumes might swap to disk.
If kubelet succeeds, the dummy tmpfs will be deleted and the  option will be used.
If the  option is not supported, kubelet will emit a warning log entry,
then continue its execution.It is deeply encouraged to encrypt the swap space.
See the section above with an example for setting unencrypted swap.
However, handling encrypted swap is not within the scope of kubelet;
rather, it is a general OS configuration concern and should be addressed at that level.
It is the administrator's responsibility to provision encrypted swap to mitigate this risk.Good practice for using swap in a Kubernetes clusterDisable swap for system-critical daemonsDuring the testing phase and based on user feedback, it was observed that the performance
of system-critical daemons and services might degrade.
This implies that system daemons, including the kubelet, could operate slower than usual.
If this issue is encountered, it is advisable to configure the cgroup of the system slice
to prevent swapping (i.e., set ).Protect system-critical daemons for I/O latencySwap can increase the I/O load on a node.
When memory pressure causes the kernel to rapidly swap pages in and out,
system-critical daemons and services that rely on I/O operations may
experience performance degradation.To mitigate this, it is recommended for systemd users to prioritize the system slice in terms of I/O latency.
For non-systemd users,
setting up a dedicated cgroup for system daemons and processes and prioritizing I/O latency in the same way is advised.
This can be achieved by setting  for the system slice,
thereby granting it higher I/O priority.
See cgroup's documentation for more info.Swap and control plane nodesThe Kubernetes project recommends running control plane nodes without any swap space configured.
The control plane primarily hosts Guaranteed QoS Pods, so swap can generally be disabled.
The main concern is that swapping critical services on the control plane could negatively impact performance.Use of a dedicated disk for swapIt is recommended to use a separate, encrypted disk for the swap partition.
If swap resides on a partition or the root filesystem, workloads may interfere
with system processes that need to write to disk.
When they share the same disk, processes can overwhelm swap,
disrupting the I/O of kubelet, container runtime, and systemd, which would impact other workloads.
Since swap space is located on a disk, it is crucial to ensure the disk is fast enough for the intended use cases.
Alternatively, one can configure I/O priorities between different mapped areas of a single backing device.As you can see, the swap feature was dramatically improved lately,
paving the way for a feature GA.
However, this is just the beginning.
It's a foundational implementation marking the beginning of enhanced swap functionality.In the near future, additional features are planned to further improve swap capabilities,
including better eviction mechanisms, extended API support, increased customizability,
better debug abilities and more!You can review the current documentation
for using swap with Kubernetes.Feel free to reach out to me, Itamar Holder ( on Slack and GitHub)

--

Mount Teide is one of the world’s largest active volcanoes, and there may be a way to use the basalt rock inside it to save humanity. Obviously, destroying an ancient volcano would cause catastrophic and unpredictable ecological fallout. But what if we harvested only some of that basalt— could it really stop climate change? Elise Cutts explores the fascinating science of enhanced rock weathering.

In an implementation-agnostic way, Kubernetes users can define how their applications should be made available on the network. Then, an ingress controller uses that definition to set up local or cloud resources as required for the user’s particular situation and needs.Many different ingress controllers are available, to suit users of different cloud providers or brands of load balancers. Ingress-nginx is a software-only ingress controller provided by the Kubernetes project. Because of its versatility and ease of use, ingress-nginx is quite popular: it is deployed in over 40% of Kubernetes clusters!Ingress-nginx translates the requirements from Ingress objects into configuration for nginx, a powerful open source webserver daemon. Then, nginx uses that configuration to accept and route requests to the various applications running within a Kubernetes cluster. Proper handling of these nginx configuration parameters is crucial, because ingress-nginx needs to allow users significant flexibility while preventing them from accidentally or intentionally tricking nginx into doing things it shouldn’t.Vulnerabilities Patched TodayFour of today’s ingress-nginx vulnerabilities are improvements to how ingress-nginx handles particular bits of nginx config. Without these fixes, a specially-crafted Ingress object can cause nginx to misbehave in various ways, including revealing the values of Secrets that are accessible to ingress-nginx. By default, ingress-nginx has access to all Secrets cluster-wide, so this can often lead to complete cluster takeover by any user or entity that has permission to create an Ingress.The most serious of today’s vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-1974, rated 9.8 CVSS, allows anything on the Pod network to exploit configuration injection vulnerabilities via the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx. This makes such vulnerabilities far more dangerous: ordinarily one would need to be able to create an Ingress object in the cluster, which is a fairly privileged action. When combined with today’s other vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-1974 means that anything on the Pod network has a good chance of taking over your Kubernetes cluster, with no credentials or administrative access required. In many common scenarios, the Pod network is accessible to all workloads in your cloud VPC, or even anyone connected to your corporate network! This is a very serious situation.First, determine if your clusters are using ingress-nginx. In most cases, you can check this by running kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx with cluster administrator permissions.If you are using ingress-nginx, make a plan to remediate these vulnerabilities immediately.If you can’t upgrade right away, you can significantly reduce your risk by turning off the Validating Admission Controller feature of ingress-nginx.If you have installed ingress-nginx using Helm
Reinstall, setting the Helm value controller.admissionWebhooks.enabled=falseIf you have installed ingress-nginx manually
delete the ValidatingWebhookconfiguration called edit the  Deployment or Daemonset, removing  from the controller container’s argument listIf you turn off the Validating Admission Controller feature as a mitigation for CVE-2025-1974, remember to turn it back on after you upgrade. This feature provides important quality of life improvements for your users, warning them about incorrect Ingress configurations before they can take effect.Conclusion, thanks, and further readingThe ingress-nginx vulnerabilities announced today, including CVE-2025-1974, present a serious risk to many Kubernetes users and their data. If you use ingress-nginx, you should take action immediately to keep yourself safe.Thanks go out to Nir Ohfeld, Sagi Tzadik, Ronen Shustin, and Hillai Ben-Sasson from Wiz for responsibly disclosing these vulnerabilities, and for working with the Kubernetes SRC members and ingress-nginx maintainers (Marco Ebert and James Strong) to ensure we fixed them effectively.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revenge of the junior developer (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/137</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/137/changelog-news-137.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Steve Yegge’s latest rant about the future of “coding”, Ethan McCue shares some life altering Postgres patterns, Hillel Wayne makes the case for Verification-First Development, Gerd Zellweger experienced lots of pain setting up GitHub Actions & Cascii is a web-based ASCII diagram builder.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

In the middle of the capital, archaeologists are digging deep to find out more about the lives and deaths of the poorest of the poor, the inmates of the workhouse.  Behind the workhouse building lies a cemetery where they were buried - now it is being carefully excavated as the whole site is being redeveloped.  It’s a rare opportunity to investigate the treatment of London’s destitute in the late 18th and 19th centuries - a story that was repeated in great cities across the world as people poured into them in search of work.

Tony has a special connection with this story - not only has been making archaeology films for decades, he also appeared as a child actor in the first stage production of the musical, “Oliver!”.  He knows digging and he knows Dickens! He explores the finds from the excavations, from humble clay pipes to dissected skeletons revealing how dead inmates could be anatomised in the name of medical science.

This film combines unique archaeology, as well as social and literary history - the care of the poor, how their plight was brought to the attention of the public and the extreme challenges created by burgeoning cities. Dickens was writing about his times, but like all good history, the heart of it remains relevant today.

The Japanese phenom, Roki Sasaki, reunited with the growing list of his compatriots in Dodgers blue, making the World Series champions an even more formidable outfit. Corbin Burnes headed to the Arizona desert, the Cubs swung a trade for Kyle Tucker, and the Red Sox beefed up their rotation by acquiring ace Garrett Crotchet. It was an offseason of typical upheaval that even saw the Oakland Athletics leave their 57-year-old home for a temporary stay in Sacramento. But as the weather warms and spring training draws to a close, the return of the MLB season is just a few days away, which can only mean it's also time for the newest iteration of MLB The Show. While last year's game was one of minor iterations, MLB The Show 25 takes a few steps in the right direction by introducing a few long overdue changes to modes like Road to the Show and Franchise.Road to the Show (RTTS) has grown stale over the past couple of years, with little to no improvements and an irritating connection to the card-collecting mode, Diamond Dynasty. This isn't the case in The Show 25, as it severs that link and completely overhauls the opening few hours of your career with the addition of amateur baseball. Now, you begin your journey to the Major Leagues as a fresh-faced high school student. By playing well in the three available games, potentially winning a high school championship, and showcasing your talents at the MLB combine, you'll garner interest from both MLB teams and the eight different college programs included in the game, such as Vanderbilt, LSU, UCLA, and Texas. You can opt to sign with an MLB team straight out of high school as an 18-year-old--like previous years' games--or head to college for four years to further improve your attributes and, ideally, increase your draft stock.Each college has a rating from one to five stars in "exposure," which impacts your draft status and rating among scouts, and "skill development," which determines how many upgrade tokens you'll earn to improve your ballplayer. Once you've chosen a college that fits your needs, the game fast-forwards to your senior year as you prepare to compete in the College Baseball World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. Depending on the outcome of each game, you can potentially play in all four on the way to winning the national championship, which will significantly boost your standing in the draft if you also play well enough. After signing for an MLB team, you can expect to be fast-tracked through the minor leagues, as opposed to spending more time in AA and AAA if you decided to skip college, so there are some impactful choices to consider.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The First Berserker: Khazan Review - A Souls-Like That Packs A Punch</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-a-souls-like-that-packs-a-punch/1900-6418346/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Richard Wakeling</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/123/1239113/4464275-firstberserker.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 17:09:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The First Berserker: Khazan has all the familiar hallmarks of a souls-like--from a bonfire-esque checkpoint system that respawns enemies to XP you can lose upon death--yet its primary influences might not be what you would expect. While its parry-heavy combat is immediately reminiscent of From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, its level-based structure, weapon skills, and approach to gear are clearly inspired by Team Ninja's Nioh. Developer Neople has some ideas of its own, too, including a multifaceted progression system and cel-shaded art style that makes The First Berserker visually distinct from most of its contemporaries. As a result, this souls-like manages to feel familiar while also carving out an identity of its own, delivering a challenging yet rewarding experience that's anchored by a hard-hitting defensive style of combat and a degree of freedom in how you choose to play.In terms of story, you play as the eponymous Khazan. Once a legendary general famed for saving the empire from the fearsome Berserk Dragon, he's falsely branded a traitor at the game's outset. After being mercilessly tortured--with the tendons in both of his arms severed--and exiled to a mountainous, snowy tundra, our hero manages to escape and forms an unlikely alliance with a mysterious entity known as Blade Phantom, who grants Khazan otherworldly powers in his quest for revenge.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Next.js rocked by critical 9.1 level exploit...</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaCnBOqyvIM</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AaCnBOqyvIM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 16:59:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get up to 67% off VPS at Hostinger.

"So I thought it would be worthwhile to make a guide for doing it on (relatively) inexpensive RK3588-powered single-board computers, using Box86/64 and Armbian."

The guides I came across were out of date, had a bunch of extra steps thrown in, or were outright incorrect... Up first, we need to add the Box86 and Box64 ARM repositories [along with dependencies, ARMHF architecture, and the Mesa graphics driver]... 
The guide closes with a multi-line script and advice to "Just close your eyes and run this. It's not pretty, but it will download the Steam Debian package, extract the needed bits, and set up a launch script." (And then the final step is sudo reboot now.) 

"At this point, all you have to do is open a terminal, type 'steam', and tap Enter. You'll have about five minutes to wait... Check out the video to see how some of the tested games perform."

At 720p, performance is all over the place, but the games I tested typically managed to stay above 30 FPS. This is better than I was expecting from a four-year-old SOC emulating x86 titles under ARM. 

Is this a practical way to play your Steam games? Nope, not even a little bit. For now, this is merely an exercise in ludicrous neatness. Things might get a wee bit better, considering Collabora is working on upstream support for RK3588 and Valve is up to something ARM-related, but ya know, "Valve Time"... 

"You might be tempted to enable Steam Play for your Windows games, but don't waste your time. I mean, you can try, but it ain't gonna work."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Immortal Final Recital of a Dying Pianist</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR-ihnTlGx0</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lR-ihnTlGx0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 18:49:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chopin Foundation: https://chopin.org

representing distributed jobs. The goal of JobSet is to provide a unified API for distributed ML
training and HPC workloads on Kubernetes.The Kubernetes community’s recent enhancements to the batch ecosystem on Kubernetes has attracted ML
engineers who have found it to be a natural fit for the requirements of running distributed training
workloads.Large ML models (particularly LLMs) which cannot fit into the memory of the GPU or TPU chips on a
single host are often distributed across tens of thousands of accelerator chips, which in turn may
span thousands of hosts.As such, the model training code is often containerized and executed simultaneously on all these
hosts, performing distributed computations which often shard both the model parameters and/or the
training dataset across the target accelerator chips, using communication collective primitives like
all-gather and all-reduce to perform distributed computations and synchronize gradients between
hosts.These workload characteristics make Kubernetes a great fit for this type of workload, as efficiently
scheduling and managing the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of compute
resources is an area where it shines.It is also very extensible, allowing developers to define their own Kubernetes APIs, objects, and
controllers which manage the behavior and life cycle of these objects, allowing engineers to develop
custom distributed training orchestration solutions to fit their needs.However, as distributed ML training techniques continue to evolve, existing Kubernetes primitives do
not adequately model them alone anymore.Furthermore, the landscape of Kubernetes distributed training orchestration APIs has become
fragmented, and each of the existing solutions in this fragmented landscape has certain limitations
that make it non-optimal for distributed ML training.For example, the KubeFlow training operator defines custom APIs for different frameworks (e.g.
PyTorchJob, TFJob, MPIJob, etc.); however, each of these job types are in fact a solution fit
specifically to the target framework, each with different semantics and behavior.On the other hand, the Job API fixed many gaps for running batch workloads, including Indexed
completion mode, higher scalability, Pod failure policies and Pod backoff policy to mention a few of
the most recent enhancements. However, running ML training and HPC workloads using the upstream Job
API requires extra orchestration to fill the following gaps:Multi-template Pods : Most HPC or ML training jobs include more than one type of Pods. The different
Pods are part of the same workload, but they need to run a different container, request different
resources or have different failure policies. A common example is the driver-worker pattern.Job groups : Large scale training workloads span multiple network topologies, running across
multiple racks for example. Such workloads are network latency sensitive, and aim to localize
communication and minimize traffic crossing the higher-latency network links. To facilitate this,
the workload needs to be split into groups of Pods each assigned to a network topology.Inter-Pod communication : Create and manage the resources (e.g. headless
Services) necessary to establish
communication between the Pods of a job.Startup sequencing : Some jobs require a specific start sequence of pods; sometimes the driver is
expected to start first (like Ray or Spark), in other cases the workers are expected to be ready
before starting the driver (like MPI).JobSet aims to address those gaps using the Job API as a building block to build a richer API for
large-scale distributed HPC and ML use cases.JobSet models a distributed batch workload as a group of Kubernetes Jobs. This allows a user to
easily specify different pod templates for different distinct groups of pods (e.g. a leader,
workers, parameter servers, etc.).It uses the abstraction of a ReplicatedJob to manage child Jobs, where a ReplicatedJob is
essentially a Job Template with some desired number of Job replicas specified. This provides a
declarative way to easily create identical child-jobs to run on different islands of accelerators,
without resorting to scripting or Helm charts to generate many versions of the same job but with
different names.Some other key JobSet features which address the problems described above include:Replicated Jobs : In modern data centers, hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs allocated in
islands of homogenous accelerators connected via a specialized, high bandwidth network links. For
example, a user might provision nodes containing a group of hosts co-located on a rack, each with
H100 GPUs, where GPU chips within each host are connected via NVLink, with a NVLink Switch
connecting the multiple NVLinks. TPU Pods are another example of this: TPU ViperLitePods consist of
64 hosts, each with 4 TPU v5e chips attached, all connected via ICI mesh. When running a distributed
training job across multiple of these islands, we often want to partition the workload into a group
of smaller identical jobs, 1 per island, where each pod primarily communicates with the pods within
the same island to do segments of distributed computation, and keeping the gradient synchronization
over DCN (data center network, which is lower bandwidth than ICI) to a bare minimum.Automatic headless service creation, configuration, and lifecycle management : Pod-to-pod
communication via pod hostname is enabled by default, with automatic configuration and lifecycle
management of the headless service enabling this.Configurable success policies : JobSet has configurable success policies which target specific
ReplicatedJobs, with operators to target “Any” or “All” of their child jobs. For example, you can
configure the JobSet to be marked complete if and only if all pods that are part of the “worker”
ReplicatedJob are completed.Configurable failure policies : JobSet has configurable failure policies which allow the user to
specify a maximum number of times the JobSet should be restarted in the event of a failure. If any
job is marked failed, the entire JobSet will be recreated, allowing the workload to resume from the
last checkpoint. When no failure policy is specified, if any job fails, the JobSet simply fails.Exclusive placement per topology domain : JobSet allows users to express that child jobs have 1:1
exclusive assignment to a topology domain, typically an accelerator island like a rack. For example,
if the JobSet creates two child jobs, then this feature will enforce that the pods of each child job
will be co-located on the same island, and that only one child job is allowed to schedule per
island. This is useful for scenarios where we want to use a distributed data parallel (DDP) training
strategy to train a model using multiple islands of compute resources (GPU racks or TPU slices),
running 1 model replica in each accelerator island, ensuring the forward and backward passes
themselves occur within a single model replica occurs over the high bandwidth interconnect linking
the accelerators chips within the island, and only the gradient synchronization between model
replicas occurs across accelerator islands over the lower bandwidth data center network.Integration with Kueue : Users can submit JobSets via Kueue to
oversubscribe their clusters, queue workloads to run as capacity becomes available, prevent partial
scheduling and deadlocks, enable multi-tenancy, and more.Distributed ML training on multiple TPU slices with JaxThe following example is a JobSet spec for running a TPU Multislice workload on 4 TPU v5e
slices. To learn more about
TPU concepts and terminology, please refer to these
docs.This example uses Jax, an ML framework with
native support for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation targeting TPU chips via
OpenXLA. However, you can also use
PyTorch/XLA to do ML training on TPUs.This example makes use of several JobSet features (both explicitly and implicitly) to support the
unique scheduling requirements of TPU multislice training out-of-the-box with very little
configuration required by the user.Future work and getting involvedWe have a number of features on the JobSet roadmap planned for development this year, which can be
found in the JobSet roadmap.Please feel free to reach out with feedback of any kind. We’re also open to additional contributors,
whether it is to fix or report bugs, or help add new features or write documentation.Last but not least, thanks to all our
contributors who made this project
possible!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💃 Chopin’s most AMORAL music? 😈 #chopin #waltz #piano</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZ-DpqWfHE</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EiZ-DpqWfHE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 19:36:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[🔥 The Chopin Podcast Season 2 is here! 🔥

Birth rates are plummeting worldwide – and while this might seem like nothing new – as it has been the case in developed countries for quite some time. The thing that is interesting is that we are seeing declining birth rates everywhere and the standard explanations that you have heard in the past don’t really hold up.
