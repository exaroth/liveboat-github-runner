We all know the cons/pros using helm… and the advantages of operators.. but how the operator installation will work in automation? I mean, seem to be the CR yaml must be deployed after the operator yaml to function properly. In my case I do not mind using operators but I need an automated way to deploy them.. Maybe I grasp the concept all wrong… how you guys tackle this? Which tools? (Ansible for instance) … my case is very specific one because I must provide to the customer a bundle of charts (umbrella) .. so I can’t even use ansible and etc.. ok I can create helm chart that will deploy the operator and the CR but it feels weird and definitely I need your opinion and guidance about the matter.

Imagine jumping out of a helicopter, "only to latch onto a speeding plane in mid-air and soar back up into the sky."


Harnessing the plane's momentum, [skydiver Max Manow] soared out of the canyon, embarking on what he calls his "endless skydive", a manoeuvre that potentially could be done continuously without him ever needing to land... 

After exiting a helicopter, he manoeuvred his wingsuit to close the gap with a nosediving Cessna 182, piloted by Luke Aikins. Precision was key: Manow attached himself to a hook on the aircraft as the plane descended, allowing him to ascend back to a safe altitude of 2,500 feet before releasing into another freefall... Manow spent five months training, including sessions in a Stockholm wind tunnel, to master the techniques needed for mid-air connection. Meanwhile, Aikins modified his aircraft to ensure the feat was safe and repeatable. 
Skydiver Max Manow's goal was to develop a manoeuvre that could potentially be repeated an infinite number of times without ever having to land. Manow's mid-air manoeuvre opens the door to a new vision of skydiving, where athletes could remain airborne without ever needing to land. Reflecting on the experience, Manow said: "Who knows where this will take the future of the sport?" 

"If that wasn't enough adrenaline for you," writes New Atlas, "a previous bonkers wingsuit stunt from 2017 is equally jaw dropping, in which a pair of skydivers BASE-jumped off a mountain summit, and entered a passing airplane."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>From Engineer to Principal Solutions Architect at AWS with Prasad Rao</title><link>https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/p/from-engineer-to-principal-solutions</link><author>/u/gregorojstersek</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 16:29:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Finding skilled developers is hard → even for seasoned engineering leaders. Traditional hiring cycles can take months while critical features sit in the backlog.Need to scale your team quickly or find specialized talent that's hard to source locally? They match you with developers from Europe and Latin America who integrate seamlessly into your workflow → without the long hiring cycles or commitment of long-term contracts.They don't just check résumés, but put developers through a rigorous multi-step vetting process that assesses technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication.Let’s get back to this week’s thought!When we talk about career paths, all of our journeys are unique. There is no one single best path that works for all of us. It’s important that you find out what path you wish to pursue and work towards it.Prasad RaoPrasad has chosen the Architecture path and I can see why very clearly. He grew as an engineer early on but later moved to the role of a Pre-sales Engineer, which helped him with speaking in both business and technical terms, creating presentations, understanding clients and managing multiple stakeholders.That particular set of skills is often hard to get from engineering roles alone, but it plays a crucial part in an Architect positions.Now, let’s get into his journey, Prasad, over to you!When engineers think about career growth, they often focus on two traditional paths: either advancing as an Individual Contributor (climbing from Senior to Staff Engineer and beyond) or transitioning into Engineering Management. However, there are other powerful career paths that are sometimes overlooked.In this article, I am sharing my journey of transitioning from an engineer to a Solutions Architect at AWS, offering insights into this alternative career trajectory.My career began as a .NET Developer, where I gradually progressed to become a Senior Developer and then a Tech Lead. The year I graduated, I interviewed for a couple of Big Tech companies but never got beyond the initial coding rounds. I thought I wasn't made for Big Tech and made peace with it. After a few initial job switches, I settled into a consulting company and started climbing the ladder. Unlike many others who choose the management track, I wanted to grow as an Individual Contributor (IC). However, many companies do not have a clearly defined IC growth path. The natural progression is to become a manager. I was looking for alternative opportunities.Even though I was working for a consulting company, I was in a unique position as I was working on building a product for a financial services company. When the product was ready, they needed someone in the field to demo it to potential clients. I took the role, and that opened a whole new world of possibilities for me.That's when I was first introduced to pre-sales activities. Instead of being an engineer on the product team, I would be part of the field team as a pre-sales engineer.Pro Tip: Don’t shy away from exploring lateral roles when an opportunity arises. Career growth is never linear.Frankly, before I started, I didn't know if such a role existed. As with any new role, there were pros and cons of being a pre-sales engineer. The pros were that I would be working more closely with customers onsite and traveling the world. The cons were that I would work on activities sometimes frowned upon by engineers - stakeholder management, customer interactions, gathering requirements, creating sales presentations, etc.Frankly, it was stepping out of my comfort zone, but it helped me develop skills that I never knew would be so important in my career growth. After a couple of years in this role working with multiple customers, I understood the importance of understanding customers' requirements and working backward to achieve them.Being an engineer, I had mostly focused on completing the tasks assigned to me. I never focused on understanding the real business reasons behind the tasks. Other skills I learned in this role:Speaking both business and technical languagesCreating stellar technical presentations and product demonstrationsUnderstanding prospective clients' business needs and designing customized solutionsCollaborating with multiple stakeholders like sales representatives, client executives, business analysts, and product teamsPro Tip: Spend time with your business stakeholders to understand the WHY behind the tasks you do on a daily basis.After a few years in the role of Pre-sales engineer, I got an opportunity to consult as a Senior Engineer/Tech Lead for a financial services customer on a digital transformation project. With improved business acumen and communication skills, I quickly became the go-to person for the customer. It was a development project, but my focus shifted to understanding the bigger picture.As developers, we design and architect components, so we're already doing architecture work without realizing it. A key to transitioning to an architect role is viewing these individual components and systems through a wider lens.To grow as an architect, you need to learn system design, distributed systems, and integration patterns. You also need to develop the mindset of considering scalability, performance, security, cost, and other factors. But those are technical skills that are relatively easy to pick up. The important thing to develop as an architect is perspective - while developers often focus deeply on specific components, architects maintain a holistic view of the entire system. For that, understanding the business requirements is essential.Thinking Like an ArchitectIn architecture, there is nothing defined as right or wrong - it's always a trade-off. There is a reason architects start their answers with "It depends." It depends on the requirements. It depends on what you would like to achieve. It depends on what constraints you're working with. Every architectural decision involves balancing multiple factors: scalability versus simplicity, performance versus maintainability, time-to-market versus perfect technical design, or cost versus capability.Lastly, to grow as an architect, it is also important to develop a broad understanding of multiple technologies. This enables you to make informed decisions about choosing the right tools for specific problems.Pro Tip: Shift your focus to look at the big picture and have a holistic view. Architects learn to navigate the ambiguity in requirements and constraints.With 10+ years in the industry, I had gained enough experience in different roles - developer, tech lead, pre-sales engineer, and architect. I was looking for a new job when one of my seniors suggested I try for AWS.I was reluctant, thinking that I would have to go through coding exercises. I was pretty hands-on, but solving LeetCode was not my cup of tea. To my surprise, I learned that coding rounds happen only for SDE roles. So if you are a naive person like me thinking that jobs at Big Tech are out of reach because of coding rounds, then please explore other roles.I browsed through multiple roles to find one that matched my profile - 'Solutions Architect, Microsoft Developer Tools on AWS'. The job role mentioned experience required with .NET and Microsoft workload stack. In the role, I had to help customers migrate and modernize their Microsoft workloads on AWS.My decade-long career was all in Microsoft technologies, but I had zero experience with AWS. I was pretty candid about that in my call with the recruiter, and still my profile got shortlisted. The entire interview process (8 rounds) was completely based on my experience and my learning ability with new technologies. No coding round whatsoever. I'm not saying the interviews were easy or that I did not have to prepare. It took a lot of hard work to prepare for the interviews, but the diverse experience I had gained helped me position myself as a good fit for a Solutions Architect role, which requires both technical and consulting skills.Pro Tip: Don't let coding interviews discourage you from applying at MAANG+ companies. Explore jobs other than SDE roles and you'll be surprised at how different the interview processes are.Having spent 5 years in the Solutions Architect (SA) role at AWS and being promoted to Principal SA has given me enough insights into what is required to become a successful SA. Ask any experienced SA about what their day-to-day role looks like, and they would answer, "Every day is different." And that's true.Let me give you a glimpse of the different hats an SA wears in their role. It will not only help you understand what a typical day of an SA looks like but also the skills you should be developing if you aspire to become an SA.cross-functional collaboratorsSo, one day I might spend a full day in whiteboarding sessions with customers, understanding their requirements and coming up with solutions using different AWS services. Another day might find me glued to my computer, creating a proof of concept to showcase the capabilities of AWS services. Then there might be days when I speak at conferences, evangelizing AWS services. Or I might spend a full day conducting workshops and training sessions to upskill customers on AWS.Pro Tip: As every customer is different and every customer problem is unique, so is each day of a Solutions Architect. And that's what I like about the SA role.

Christology is the theology of Jesus—the person, life, nature, essence and meaning of the Godhead Being who was incarnated in the human person Jesus. Some Christian theologians claim that aspects of Christology can articulate with fundamental understandings of science. Most scientists would be baffled by the claim.

The text portrayed as generated by AI has been available on the business's website since at least August 2020, as shown on this archived webpage. Google didn't launch Gemini until 2023, meaning Gemini couldn't have generated the website description as depicted in the ad. 

The site Futurism calls the situation "beyond bizarre," asking why Google doesn't seem to trust its own technology.
Either Google faked the ad entirely, or prompted its AI to generate the web page's existing copy word-for-word, or the AI was prompted to come up with original copy and instead copied the old version. In the publishing industry, that's referred to as "plagiarism." 

And ironically if Gemini did plagiarize that text, the text that it plagiarized is also inaccurate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Curious Intel Linux Driver Maintainer Changes In Recent Days</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Linux-Maintainer-Changes</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 15:33:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week besides the drama over Apple Silicon maintainership for the upstream Linux kernel, in recent days there has also been a number of rather subtle changes to the maintainership of several Intel Linux kernel drivers...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Is Isaac&apos;s Storm?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjpEvEKzkqs</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OjpEvEKzkqs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 15:30:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

So I am honestly out of the loop of what normal people use to deploy their apps.I am deploying to a bunch of hosts/VMs. I have several services, all in Go, so it is mostly a single binary file, sometimes a binary and a text config or a folder with js/css/images. I don’t have a problem of managing dependencies. My apps are stateful, they store data locally in files. Some apps Re web or grpc apps, some are async workers. I have a simple capistrano-like script which copies new artifacts to each host over ssh, updates a symlink and restarts the service. It works. But I am curious what tools do you use for that without reinventing a wheel?I am trying to avoid any new dependency unless it is absolutely necessary.

The complexity of cancers makes treatments expensive to develop and challenging to customize, but the approach of making life more livable with cancer is changing the face of the disease. He talks about why their mindset is "nothing is impossible." Bourla says a new technology can turbocharge treatment and holds great promise. He speaks to David Westin on "Wall Street Week."

The Netzarim Corridor is a six-kilometer militarized zone that was created by Israel in the early days of the war, cutting the territory in two. Palestinians are now moving between Gaza's north and south. Tens of thousands fled to southern Gaza as Israel's war against Hamas intensified in the north.

We are moving on," Latvia's Energy Minister Kaspars Melnis told Reuters in Vilaka.Russia cooperates with cut offAuthorities were on guard on Saturday for any potential sabotage or other risks linked to the grid switch from Russia.The decision to swith to the European power grid has been long in the making.Latvian grid operator AST said no disruptions had been recorded so far, showing no provocation."They disconnected power to the same line also from their side, with the biggest surprise today being that there are no surprises," AST CEO Rolands Irklis said.Lithuania's state-run grid operator Litgrid also said Russia fully cooperated during the disconnection process.Litgrid chief Rokas Masiulis pointed out that "when you are part of the same (electricity) system, you cannot harm the other without harming yourself".For Russia, the decoupling means its Kaliningrad exclave, located between Lithuania, Poland and the Baltic Sea, is cut off from Russia's main grid, leaving it to maintain its power system alone.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed all concerns.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lends an ear to Vladimir Putin.()Asked about the cut-off last week, he said: "We have taken all measures to ensure the uninterrupted reliable operation of our unified energy system."Power grid was the last link to Soviet overlordPlans for the Baltics to decouple from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord has been debated for decades and was finally signed in 2018.The grid was the final remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the Soviet Union.All three joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.The deal to disconnect from Russia's power grid was signed by Baltic leaders in 2018.()The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped purchases of power from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilise networks to avoid outages."By ending the energy dependence of the Baltic states on Russia, we are leaving the aggressor without the option of using energy as a weapon against us," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.Despite there being no provocation so far, nations in the area are increasing security on their power grids.In Estonia, police and volunteer defence corps will man critical electrical infrastructure until next weekend because of the perceived sabotage risk.Lithuania was also guarding infrastructure, launching its armed forces in a region bordering Poland to secure the energy link.Security around the power grids has been increased.An army truck was seen at the Rezekne power substation near the Latvia-Russia border, and officers with guns were patrolling the vicinity.Region on high alert to shadow warfareThe Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipeline outages.All were believed to have been caused by ships dragging anchors along the seabed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Russia has denied any involvement.The NATO alliance fears that Russia is targeting cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called "hybrid warfare" to destabilise European nations helping Ukraine.Without specifically blaming Russia, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said "hybrid means sabotage".NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has concerns over hybrid warfare in the region."Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure," he added.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have said that the slate of incidents in the Baltic Sea must be assumed to be part of a hybrid strategy from Russia that is threatening European countries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Don&apos;t &quot;optimize&quot; conditional moves in shaders with mix()+step()</title><link>https://iquilezles.org/articles/gpuconditionals/</link><author>romes</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 12:42:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this article I want to correct a popular misconception that's been making the rounds in computer graphics aficionado circles for a long time now. It has to do with branching in the GPUs. Unfortunately there are a couple of educational websites out there that are spreading some misinformation and it would be nice correcting that. I tried contacting the authors without success, so without further ado, here goes my attempt to fix things up:
So, say I have this code, which I actually published the other day: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);
     x>?(s.x,):
           x>?s*():
                      (,s.y);
}
The exact details of what it does don't matter for this discussion. All we care about is the two ternary operations, which as you know, implement conditional execution. Indeed, depending on the value of the variable , the function will return different results. This could be implemented also with regular  statements, and all that I'm going to say stays the same.
But here's the problem - when seeing code like this, somebody somewhere will invariably propose the following "optimization", which replaces what they believe (erroneously) are "conditional branches" by arithmetical operations. They will suggest something like this: snap45(  v )
{
     s = (v);
     x = (v.x);

     w0 = (,x);
     w1 = (,x)*(-w0);
     w2 = -w0-w1;

     res0 = (s.x,);
     res1 = (s.x,s.y)*();
     res2 = (,s.y);

     w0*res0 + w1*res1 + w2*res2;
}
There are two things wrong with this practice. The first one shows an incorrect understanding of how the GPU works. In particular, the original shader code had no conditional branching in it. Selecting between a few registers with a ternary operator or with a plain  statement does not lead to conditional branching; all it involves is a conditional move (a.k.a. "select"), which is a simple instruction to route the correct bits to the destination register. You can think of it as a bitwise AND+NAND+OR on the source registers, which is a simple combinational circuit. Again, there is no branching - the instruction pointer isn't manipulated, there's no branch prediction involved, no instruction cache to invalidation, no nothing.
For the record, of course real branches do happen in GPU code, but those are not what's used by the GPU for small moves between registers like we have here. This is true for any GPU made in the last 20+ years. While I'm not an expert in CPUs, I am pretty sure this is true for them as well.
The second wrong thing with the supposedly optimizer version is that it actually runs much slower than the original version. The reason is that the  function is actually implemented like this: step(  x,  y )
{
     x < y ?  : ;
}
So people using the step() "optimization" are using the ternary operation anyways, which produces the  or  which they will use to select the output, only wasting two multiplications and one or two additions. The values could have been conditionally moved directly, which is what the original shader code did.
But don't take my word for it, let's look at the generated machine code for the relevant part of the shader I published:
GLSL x>?(s.x,):
       x>?s*():
                  (,s.y);
AMD Compiler     s0,      v3, , v1
     v4, , v0
     s1,   vcc, (v2), s0
 v3, 0, v3, vcc
 v0, v0, v4, vcc
 vcc, (v2), s1
 v1, v1, v3, vcc
 v0, 0, v0, vcc
Microsoft Compiler   r0.xy, l(, ), v0.xy
   r0.zw, v0.xy, l(, )
 r0.xy, -r0.xyxx, r0.zwzz
 r0.xy, r0.xyxx
  r1.xyzw, r0.xyxy, l4()
   r2.xy, l(,), v0.xx  r0.z, l()
 r1.xyzw, r2.yyyy, r1.xyzw, r0.zyzy
 o0.xyzw, r2.xxxx, r0.xzxz, r1.xyzw
Here we can see that the GPU is not branching. Instead, according to the AMD compiler, it's performing the required comparisons ( and  - cmp=compare, gt=greater than, ngt=not greated than), and then using the result to mask the results with the bitwise operations mentioned earlier ( - cnd=conditional).
The Microsoft compiler has expressed the same idea/implementation in a different format, but you can still see the comparison ( - "lt"=less than) and the masking or conditional move ( - mov=move, c=conditionally).
Not related to the discussion, but also note that the  call does not become a GPU instruction and instead becomes an instruction modifier, which is free.
So, if you ever see somebody proposing this a = ( b, c, ( y, x ) );
as an optimization to
then please correct them for me. The misinformation has been around for 20 years / 10 GPU generation, and that's more than too long.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Protesting students accompanied by bikers and farmers blockade bridge in Serbia&apos;s capital Belgrade</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i8iNxaubSc</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0i8iNxaubSc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 12:31:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[University students are leading the anti-graft demonstrations which erupted after a concrete canopy crashed at the central train station in Novi Sad on Nov. 1.

But he complains that many developers "use C++ as if it was still the previous millennium," in an article titled 21st Century C++ that promises "the key concepts on which performant, type safe, and flexible C++ software can be built: resource management, life-time management, error-handling, modularity, and generic programming... 

"At the end, I present ways to ensure that code is contemporary, rather than relying on outdated, unsafe, and hard-to-maintain techniques: guidelines and profiles."

To help developers focus on effective use of contemporary C++ and avoid outdated "dark corners" of the language, sets of guidelines have been developed. Here I focus on the C++ Core guidelines that I consider the most ambitious... My principal aim is a type-safe and resource-safe use of ISO standard C++. That is: 

- Every object is exclusively used according to its definition
- No resource is leaked 
This encompasses what people refer to as memory safety and much more. It is not a new goal for C++. Obviously, it cannot be achieved for every use of C++, but by now we have years of experience showing that it can be done for modern code, though so far enforcement has been incomplete... When thinking about C++, it is important to remember that C++ is not just a language but part of an ecosystem consisting of implementations, libraries, tools, teaching, and more. 
WG21 (and others) are working on "profiles" to enforce guidelines (though they're "not yet available, except for experimental and partial versions"). But Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines "use a strategy known as subset-of-superset."

 First: extend the language with a few library abstractions: use parts of the standard library and add a tiny library to make use of the guidelines convenient and efficient (the Guidelines Support Library, GSL).
 Next: subset: ban the use of low-level, inefficient, and error-prone features. 
What we get is "C++ on steroids": Something simple, safe, flexible, and fast; rather than an impoverished subset or something relying on massive run-time checking. Nor do we create a language with novel and/or incompatible features. The result is 100% ISO standard C++. Messy, dangerous, low-level features can still be enabled and used when needed. 
Stroustrup writes that the C++ Core Guidelines focus on rules "we hope that everyone eventually could benefit from."

No uninitialized variables
No range or nullptr violations
No resource leaks
No dangling pointers
No type violations
No invalidation

The polyamide panel is then manufactured through selective laser sintering (SLS), a technique where each level is sintered by a laser beam, directed by a scanning system. The process is repeated, and the prototype is built layer by layer. SLS is chosen as the most appropriate fabrication technique since it does not require supports to sustain oblique and horizontal protrusions and it allows to fabricate undercuts. However, to manufacture hollow structures like the UCs, it is necessary to include at least two apertures (on the top and bottom surfaces) for each UC cavity, in order to remove any residual powder from the fabrication process, so an additional opening is added for each UC. For the measurement phase, these additional openings are closed with properly sized polyamide caps that are fixed with aluminum tape to guarantee an acoustic seal. A 3D view of the final panel is shown in Fig. 7c.4.2 FE model of the AM panelThe AM panel can be modelled in FE using six different domains, shown in Fig.8, three of which are structural domains (the AM panel side walls, the front and back surfaces) and three are acoustic domains (the UC cavity voids, and the aperture “caps” on the front and back surfaces).(1) F.

The report "commended the agency's handling of last year's beleaguered Boeing's Starliner mission [prioritizing astronaut safety], but revealed yet another issue found during the flight and questioned the agency's needs for the spacecraft in the future..."

[The report] stated that it was unclear how a decision was made to waive a failure tolerance requirement on some of the thrusters without flight or qualification data to justify the decision. "These examples illustrate the panel's concern that, absent role clarity, risk management choices could unintentionally devolve to contractors, whose interests may not fully align with NASA's," the report warned... 

It also revealed that in addition to the thruster and leak issues on the propulsion module driving the decision to fly home without astronauts, Starliner had a new issue as it made its way back to Earth. "Overall, Starliner performed well across all major systems in the undock, deorbit, and landing sequences; however, an additional mono propellant thruster failure was discovered in the crew module — distinct from the failures in the service module experienced during orbit," the report stated. "Had the crew been aboard, this would have significantly increased the risk during reentry, confirming the wisdom of the decision." 

As far as Starliner's path to certification, the ASAP report said it would continue to monitor several unresolved issues with thrusters and seek information on how NASA and Boeing plan to get the spacecraft certified. "While the thruster issues have received considerable attention, the panel has previously noted other Starliner issues that require resolution prior to certification," it stated. That includes a battery redesign and work to strengthen the landing airbag apparatus. "Beyond these technical matters, schedule and budget pose substantial challenges to Starliner certification," the report added... 
"Until the Starliner certification plan is well understood, it remains unclear as to whether a second provider will be available prior to the end of the ISS's operational life [in 2030]," the report stated. 

The report "also suggested that NASA immediately adapt next-generation extravehicular mobility units, or EVUs," reports ExecutiveGov, "as current space suits astronauts use for operations outside the ISS are now beyond their design life."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>IO_uring Zero-Copy Receive Support Ready For Linux 6.15 Networking</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/IO_uring-Zero-Copy-Receive-Net</link><author>/u/unixbhaskar</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 08:33:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

That's a good reason to disallow them in libs, but for bin crates that's not really a concern, and arguably the risk is something we should leave up to the application developer, the end user.I'd also consider going a step further, since there will be commonly popular orphans. Perhaps they should also be allowed in first order dependencies of bin crates, to prevent people from vendoring/copy-pasting common orphans. The same logic of allowing user discretion applies to first order dependencies to a bin crate. It would be sorta weird to create a sort of bifurcation in the lib crates, but not really a huge issue since most don't need orphans anw.This is an existing concept, allowing/semi-encouraging dirtiness and laziness in bin/app crates for the sake of productivity. Like how anyhow is bad in libs but ok if you're writing an app.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Baltic nations disconnect from Russian power grid to avoid power being used &apos;as a weapon&apos;</title><link>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-09/baltic-nations-disconnect-from-russia-power-grid/104915528</link><author>/u/miolmok</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 07:55:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Three Baltic nations have disconnected their electricity systems from Russia's power grid as part of a plan designed to further integrate with the European Union and boost security.Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania disconnected from the network in a move to block Russia's ability to geopolitically "blackmail" them via the electricity system.If all goes as planned, the power system will merge with the European energy networks on Sunday afternoon local time through several links with Finland, Sweden and Poland.All three countries are former Soviet republics that are now in the European Union and NATO."We have removed any theoretical possibility of Russia using energy [grid] control as a weapon," Lithuanian Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said.The Baltic countries spent nearly 1.6 billion euros ($2.6 billion) since 2018 to upgrade grids to prepare for the switch.The EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said this is a "victory for freedom"."Russia can no longer use energy as a tool of blackmail," she added.'No European country should be dependent on Russia'The European Commissioner for Energy, Dan Jorgensen, said: "This is indeed a historic day.""I like the light better when there's no Russian electrons involved," he told reporters in Estonian capital Tallinn."It's important to underline that this is about security … no European country should be dependent on Russia for anything," he added.The operators from all three nations successfully undertook frequency management trials before disconnecting."The system is stable, the process is happening smoothly, no one is noticing that something changed," Latvia's Energy Minister Kaspars Melnis said.Lithuanian Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas said there are contingency plans whereby some heavy energy users, such as factories, could be temporarily disconnected from the grid in the event of power shortages."We've reached the goal we strived for, for so long," Mr Vaiciunas told a press conference.Latvian Energy Minister Kaspars Melnis was on the ground for the power grid disconnection.In Latvia, immediately after disconnecting, workers used a crane to reach the high-voltage wires in Vilaka, 100 metres from the Russian border, and cut them. Staff handed out chopped wire as keepsakes to cheering observers."We will never use it again. We are moving on," Latvia's Energy Minister Kaspars Melnis told Reuters in Vilaka.Russia cooperates with cut offAuthorities were on guard on Saturday for any potential sabotage or other risks linked to the grid switch from Russia.The decision to swith to the European power grid has been long in the making.Latvian grid operator AST said no disruptions had been recorded so far, showing no provocation."They disconnected power to the same line also from their side, with the biggest surprise today being that there are no surprises," AST CEO Rolands Irklis said.Lithuania's state-run grid operator Litgrid also said Russia fully cooperated during the disconnection process.Litgrid chief Rokas Masiulis pointed out that "when you are part of the same (electricity) system, you cannot harm the other without harming yourself".For Russia, the decoupling means its Kaliningrad exclave, located between Lithuania, Poland and the Baltic Sea, is cut off from Russia's main grid, leaving it to maintain its power system alone.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed all concerns.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lends an ear to Vladimir Putin.()Asked about the cut-off last week, he said: "We have taken all measures to ensure the uninterrupted reliable operation of our unified energy system."Power grid was the last link to Soviet overlordPlans for the Baltics to decouple from the grid of their former Soviet imperial overlord has been debated for decades and was finally signed in 2018.The grid was the final remaining link to Russia for the three countries, which re-emerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the Soviet Union.All three joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.The deal to disconnect from Russia's power grid was signed by Baltic leaders in 2018.()The three staunch supporters of Kyiv stopped purchases of power from Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but have relied on the Russian grid to control frequencies and stabilise networks to avoid outages."By ending the energy dependence of the Baltic states on Russia, we are leaving the aggressor without the option of using energy as a weapon against us," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.Despite there being no provocation so far, nations in the area are increasing security on their power grids.In Estonia, police and volunteer defence corps will man critical electrical infrastructure until next weekend because of the perceived sabotage risk.Lithuania was also guarding infrastructure, launching its armed forces in a region bordering Poland to secure the energy link.Security around the power grids has been increased.An army truck was seen at the Rezekne power substation near the Latvia-Russia border, and officers with guns were patrolling the vicinity.Region on high alert to shadow warfareThe Baltic Sea region is on high alert after power cable, telecom links and gas pipeline outages.All were believed to have been caused by ships dragging anchors along the seabed following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Russia has denied any involvement.The NATO alliance fears that Russia is targeting cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called "hybrid warfare" to destabilise European nations helping Ukraine.Without specifically blaming Russia, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said "hybrid means sabotage".NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has concerns over hybrid warfare in the region."Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure," he added.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have said that the slate of incidents in the Baltic Sea must be assumed to be part of a hybrid strategy from Russia that is threatening European countries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I think linux is actually easier to use than windows now</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1il9tes/i_think_linux_is_actually_easier_to_use_than/</link><author>/u/petitlita</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 07:55:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I had to reinstall windows on the one PC that I was (previously) running windows on, basically just for debugging windows programs and the 2 games that don't play well with linux. One is a ported browser game that still works in browser and the other is kinitopet where windows being required is kinda understandable. Found a disk for windows that came with a laptop and put it in, oops, I don't have TPM 2. Tried downloading windows 10. Mysterious driver issues that it refused to elaborate on, apparently I needed to find these drivers and put them on a USB without it giving me any information on what I was looking for. I got sick of dealing with it at this point since it really gave no information and I just wanted to play witcher, though I know if I had worked out the driver issues I would still need to work through getting a local account, debloating the OS, modifying the registry, etc, just to get it to run in a way any reasonable person would expect a normal computer to behave.So I decide to just put endeavour OS on it instead (I have a recent nvidia GPU and I am lazy) and like, yeah it works well basically immediately, but what surprised me was how well it played with... everything. On windows, I spent 2 hours just fixing weird audio bugs with the steelseries wireless headset I have but it just works and connects immediately after I turn it on now. I didn't need to use their bloatware to turn off sidetone. The controller I use would require a bit of fiddling to connect when I turned it on on windows but on linux I just pick it up and it works. I install my games and they all (minux the aforementioned two) just work perfectly immediately. I don't get random video stuttering that I had on windows. WHEN did the linux experience become so seamless?Edit: In case anyone is curious, in witcher I am getting 60fps (cap) when previously I was getting like 45 lol]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JRE Fight Companion - February 8, 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGL1vitx_rM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IGL1vitx_rM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 07:45:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe is joined by Matt Serra, Brendan Schaub & Bryan Callen to watch the fights on February 8, 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fluxcd useful features</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1il9d9q/fluxcd_useful_features/</link><author>/u/Upper-Aardvark-6684</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 07:22:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been using fluxcd as gitops tool since 6 months at my job.

But at the same time YouTube is running ads on TikTok, reports Bloomberg, targeting TikTok content creators in "an effort to lure these valuable users to the Google-owned rival and capitalize on TikTok's uncertain future." 

One of YouTube's ads even received over a thousand likes, with Bloomberg calling it that TikTok "is willing to accept ad dollars from one of its fiercest competitors promoting a message aimed at undercutting its business."


YouTube is the latest TikTok competitor to try to capitalize on the app's looming US ban, which could go into effect in early April. Meta Platforms Inc.'s Instagram announced a new video editing tool in January, and X also teased a new video tab as part of an effort to win over TikTok's content creators... 

Google would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a ban in the US. Both its flagship video service YouTube and its TikTok copycat, YouTube Shorts, would likely see an uptick in traffic if TikTok goes away. Google also plays an unusual role in TikTok's potential ban because it runs one of two mobile app stores controlling whether people in the US can download the video app. It has blocked TikTok from its Google Play store since the divest-or-ban law went into effect January 19.

Just making note because I was vague about it prior. My bad!I'll try to make this as quick as I possibly can: I finally decide to dive into the world of Linux and I LOVE it! Been using that more than Windows now on my laptop and I've also been experimenting with the terminal and installing some different applications to try out too. Now I'm extremely passionate about technology and learning new things, and I'm also someone who can get hyperfixated on a topic. And this time it was about the cool things I was working on using Ubuntu, which included installing and adding different applications' dependencies as well as trying out some other things to make my experience more decentralized. Well, that backfired because I was went off on and told that I need to just go back to "a normal device and stop playing around with that USB all the time."I tried to explain that Ubuntu is a normal operating system but was just a little different than Windows or Apple and that I installed it myself on my own USB. But that did nothing. And discussing decentralization made them start presuming that I was "up to no good and that I would get into trouble with that command stuff," which is referencing the terminal and what it looks like when I install packages. Like, really, people? I get that not everybody's versed in computers, but you're literally assuming that something I'm passionate about must be troublesome because you're not familiar with it. Any way to explain that I'm just being tech-savvy and using a regular operating system that just happens to look a little different? ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Brain Hyperconnectivity in Children with Autism and Its Links to Social Deficits (2013)</title><link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(13)00570-6</link><author>stmw</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 03:54:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Could outrage over treatment of released Israelis and Palestinians destabilize the ceasefire deal?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WGw0rMqVzs</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0WGw0rMqVzs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 02:34:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hamas has released three more Israeli hostages who had been held in Gaza. The three male hostages — Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy — were handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah before being reunited with their families.

Royce Newcomb "developed prototypes of his products and received local and national media attention for them. For example, Time Magazine included his eLiT Address Box & Security System, which used mobile networks to pinpoint home and business locations, on its Best Inventions of 2021 list." 

But then he told investors he'd also received a grant by the National Science Foundation — one of "several false representations to his investors to deceive and cheat them out of their money... Newcomb used the money to pay for gambling, a Mercedes and Jaguar, and a mansion."
He also used the money to pay for refunds to other investors who wanted out, and to pay for new, unrelated projects without the investors' authorization. During this period, Newcomb also received a fraudulent COVID-19 loan for more than $70,000 from the Small Business Administration and fraudulent loans for more than $190,000 from private lenders. He lied about Strategic Innovations having hundreds of thousands and even millions in revenue to get these loans. 
Newcomb was previously convicted federally in 2011 for running a real estate fraud scheme in Sacramento. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison for that offense, and he was on federal supervised release for that offense when he committed the offenses charged in this case... Newcomb faces maximum statutory penalties of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the wire fraud charge, and 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the money laundering charge... 
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

SFGate writes that "Despite receiving significant funding, his startup, Strategic Innovations, never made a dime or released any products to market, according to legal documents."

The owner of a California tech startup has pleaded guilty to stealing over $4 million from investors, private lenders and the U.S. government in order to live a luxurious lifestyle, the United States Attorney's Office announced Monday...

"A lack of real independence can mean a lack of agency for those who would like to properly get involved in a project."

Their article makes the case that the "spirit" of open source means more than a license...

"Android, in a license sense, is perhaps the most well-documented, perfectly open 'thing' that there is," Luis Villa, co-founder and general counsel at Tidelift, said in a panel discussion at the State of Open Con25 in London this week. "All the licenses are exactly as you want them — but good luck getting a patch into that, and good luck figuring out when the next release even is...." 

"If you think about the practical accessibility of open source, it goes beyond the license, right?" Peter Zaitsev, founder of open source database services company Percona, said in the panel discussion. "Governance is very important, because if it's a single corporation, they can change a license like 'that.'" These sentiments were echoed in a separate talk by Dotan Horovits, open source evangelist at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), where he mused about open source "turning to the dark side." He noted that in most cases, issues arise when a single-vendor project decides to make changes based on its own business needs among other pressures. "Which begs the question, is vendor-owned open source an oxymoron?" Horovits said. "I've been asking this question for a good few years, and in 2025 this question is more relevant than ever." 
The article adds that in 2025, "These debates won't be going anywhere anytime soon, as open source has emerged as a major focal point in the AI realm." And it includes this quote from Tidelift's co-founder. 
"I have my quibbles and concerns about the open source AI definition, but it's really clear that what Llama is doing isn't open source," Villa said.

Emily Omier, a consultant for open source businesses and host of the Business of Open Source podcast, added that such attempts to "corrupt" the meaning behind "open source" is testament to its inherent power. 

Much of this may be for regulatory reasons, however. The EU AI Act has a special carve-out for "free and open source" AI systems (aside from those deemed to pose an "unacceptable risk"). And Villa says this goes some way toward explaining why a company might want to rewrite the rulebook on what "open source" actually means. "There are plenty of actors right now who, because of the brand equity [of open source] and the regulatory implications, want to change the definition, and that's terrible," Villa said.

              In case you’ve not heard of it,  is Google’s experimental
              open-source “C++-successor
              language”. As a very rough first approximation, think Objective-C/Swift, Java/Kotlin, C/C++, C++/Carbon.
              It is also frequently mentioned in the same breath as Herb Sutter’s Cppfront and Sean Baxter’s Circle (and
              Rust, surprise surprise).
            
              Like with any ‘successor language’, the overall goal includes (at the bare minimum) near-seamless
              interoperability, as well as  improvements over the original language.
              (Otherwise it can hardly be called a successor, duh.)
            
              If you’ve clicked on the article, you’re probably waiting for me to admit that I’m lying, and to tell you
              that (in fact) Carbon  a programming language.
            
              And yes, it’s true! Carbon is a programming language. (Or rather, it’s  to be a
              programming language. Carbon is an experimental project and hasn’t hit its 0.1 release milestone yet. The
              Carbon developers are very transparent about this.)
            
              But in my humble opinion, thinking of Carbon as a ‘programming language’ is kind of missing the point. Let
              me tell you how I think about Carbon, and why I think that it’s more interesting than most people give it
              credit for:
            
                Carbon is a concentrated experimental effort to develop tooling that will facilitate automated
                large-scale long-term migrations of existing C++ code to a modern, well-annotated programming language
                with a modern, transparent process of evolution and governance model.
              
              The entirety of Carbon (the language, as well as the project) is built around making this goal possible.
              (Disclaimer, I don’t speak for Carbon, take my words with a grain of salt.)
            In this post, I want to convince you of the following points:
                Carbon is a project to investigate the possibility of a large-scale reduction of C++ technical debt via
                automated code migration.
                Many so-called ‘successor languages’ are . They don’t make
                 an explicit goal, and generally build a layer of abstraction on top of
                or rely on their host language.
              
                All of this is downstream of Google’s disagreements with the C++ Standard Committee. In fact, while all
                of this is about reducing technical debt, it’s also about reducing the organizational costs involved in
                having to coordinate migrations and language evolution with the committee.
              Developing a new programming language is probably necessary to achieve the goals of the project.
              I’d like to bring special attention to the point about governance: This isn’t just a technical issue. It’s
              a governance issue. It’s a “We just straight-up disagree on the future direction of the C++ programming
              language.” sort of issue. I already went over these cultural disagreements in
              a previous post.
            
              (The astute reader will note that you can evolve and govern your own programming language however you
              want, without needing to deal with WG21 (aka the C++ Standard Committee, aka the authority that decides
              what C++ .))
            
              At this point I’d  to reach for the Herb Sutter “We must minimize the need to change existing
              code.” quote again,
              but I’ll instead just state the obvious:
            
              A large-scale migration to a different programming language is  paradigm. As far as
              changes to existing code go, it’s uncompromising. It’s an approach that’s only going to work for a subset
              of people, and in fact,
              Carbon’s goal document
              lists “We consider it a non-goal to support legacy code for which the source code is no longer available”.
            
              In other words, the language is not for everyone. That’s fine! I am still very interested in it. I care
              about Carbon since I believe that it’s trying to solve the hardest problem C++ is currently facing.
            
              This isn’t any  technical issue (there are many, many of those), no, and it’s not even a
              broad concern such as memory safety.
            
              It’s the problem of C++ slowly calcifying and struggling to modernize. It’s about ABI, about dozens of
              tools but no agreed upon standards, and it’s about backwards compatibility. It’s about allowing existing
              C++ code to , modernize and change, in spite of decades of technical debt, multiple
              implementations, and many different users with different expectations and requirements.
            This is, in other words, an , and a .
              If you believe that certain multi-million line C++ codebases are still going to exist in twenty years,
              then you should understand the business case for Carbon.
            A short lesson in history
              Let’s briefly summarize the backstory for those who haven’t kept track. You could (very roughly) say that
              Google is developing Carbon due to conflicts with WG21, and disagreements about the future of the C++
              language.
            
              What matters is that Google contributed to WG21 for many years, and that it has a vested interest in the
              future of the language, due to owning many,  million lines of C++ code. It’s hard to
              overstate how critical C++ is for Google’s infrastructure, and for modern technology in general.
            
              The short summary is that Google’s developers (not just Google’s, mind you) disagreed with other parts of
              the committee about the
              future direction of the C++ language. There are a lot of reasons for this, and
              a lot of ink has been spilled on the
              topic. Eventually, after trying to work with WG21 for many years, Google basically threw in the towel.
              (You cannot blame them. They tried hard, and the WG21 process is notoriously slow and frustrating.)
            
              At this point, a lot of people might think that the core disagreement between Google and WG21 was about
              ‘memory safety’, or something like that.
            
              The current memory safety hype is a pretty big deal for C++, but the ball was already rolling several
              years ago. All of this started with concerns about C++’s complexity
              and .
              It turns out that fixing certain issues would require backwards incompatible changes (bad!). Coordinating
              this across the entire C++ ecosystem would be more or less impossible.
            
              I’ll not get into the details and instead point at Chandler Carruth’s
              ‘There are no zero-cost abstractions’
              for an example: It pins down how first of all,  has a runtime overhead, and
              second of all, how fixing this would require an ABI-break and a language change.
            
              (That doesn’t mean Google doesn’t care about memory safety, of course. They do. But memory safety isn’t
              what started the whole conflict, even though it’s currently carrying the torch. That’s why memory safety
              is still relevant to all of this, especially since making C++ memory safe without compromising the vision
              of the standard committee looks more or less impossible.)
            Migration & Language Evolution
              First of all, that Carbon has  as one of its goals should be clear. The
              Carbon people are
              very explicit about this. It’s also a common theme in
              their talks.
            
              This is, first and foremost, about moving  from the “We mustn’t break existing code, so we
              had to squeeze in this new feature/syntax in some awkward way .” approach to language
              evolution. ( and the (proposed) reflection operator () are sending
              their regards.)
            
              This approach to language evolution kind of sucks. It’s not like the committee doesn’t
               the problem, or doesn’t  to evolve the language. The committee is not
              evil, and it’s not your enemy. C++ is just incredibly hard to evolve for all sorts of reasons, which would
              honestly justify an article on their own (ABI, multiple implementations and the committee process, no
              unified ecosystem, no editions or epochs system, no unified migration tooling, widespread dynamic linking,
              etc.)
            Carbon’s goal is to move away from that.
              How? Via automated tooling, a well-defined process of language evolution with clear guarantees, etc.
              Carbon is still highly experimental, so the details are still WIP. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re
              planning to follow in the footsteps of other modern languages. As an example, consider how Rust manages:
            
                Have a new ’edition’ every three years or so. Each edition is allowed to make certain breaking changes,
                but modules from separate editions can be compiled and linked together.
              
                Ship automated migration tooling with the language, which allows an automatic migration of code to the
                new edition whenever possible.
              
                If you want to eg. introduce a new keyword, you  it one edition ahead of time.
                Raw Identifier syntax
                allows migration and use of old code that still uses this keyword as an identifier.
              In contrast to this, I don’t think there’s any feasible roadmap to get C++ to this state.It’s only possible with an ecosystem split, and that’s exactly the point.
              Let me reiterate this. If there’s one thing you take from this article, it’s this here: The
               is to make it possible to take existing C++ code and to put it onto a path
              towards a modern, well-defined process for future evolution and changes.
            
              This is the point. If you want to be cynical, it’s about cutting the dependency on the standard committee,
              and it’s about allowing any forwards-looking, backwards-incompatible changes , without
              having to worry about someone else’s ancient binaries from the 80s.
            
              I just want to make clear that I believe that Carbon is radically different from
              Cpp2 (ie. Herb Sutter’s experimental
              project to evolve C++).
            
              The major difference is that Cpp2 tries to leverage the existing C++ language to its full extent, while
              Carbon tries to minimize its dependency on C++ wherever possible.
            
              Cpp2 takes the same approach C++ originally did: It transpiles its own code to the host language, and is
              thus deeply and intrinsically linked to it. It reuses the C++ standard library with all of its problems,
              it aims to maintain the C++ ecosystem instead of splitting it.
            
              Perhaps most importantly, Cpp2 also cannot go  than C++: It cannot directly interface with
              the compiler, since it’s written to be used by “any standard-compliant C++20 compiler”.
            
              It should be obvious that it’s basically impossible for Cpp2 to make meaningful reductions to C++’s
              technical debt. Yes, it can be “C++, except with better defaults and syntax.”, but that’s all it can
              feasibly be as long as full backwards compatibility is an explicit goal. Reducing C++’s technical debt on
              a deeper level is  for Cpp2.
            
              It  reduce the number of ways there are to initialize objects by simplifying syntax. It
               make any changes that would require an ABI-break, it cannot add null-safety to the
              language (eg.  can still be null,  can still be valueless), and
              it can’t prevent your code from blowing up in exciting ways due to lifetime issues.
              Carbon has the advantage that it  make these changes. (eg. Carbon is planning to move away
              from exceptions, in favor of treating errors as values.)
            
              Just to be clear, this is fine! I am not saying Cpp2 is bad, and I’m curious to see how the project
              develops. I am just highlighting that Carbon and Cpp2 are completely different projects with
              completely different scopes and goals.
            
              It is written by Herb Sutter, someone who very clearly  C++ as it is, and who wants to make
              it easier to use. It’s about having a new syntax, and making it  to apply best practices
              to your C++ code.
            
              This is a great idea, and a much less invasive proposal than Carbon. Carbon isn’t that. Carbon is about
              reworking the language from the ground up. It’s about building a  language that can
              support almost all of the same semantics, but is still critically different. It’s about reworking the
              fundamentals, and building stronger abstractions.
            
              So in short, Cpp2 works  C++, and Carbon is trying to  a better C++ from
              scratch, while cutting its dependency on C++ almost completely.
            
              Is Carbon feasible? I’ll be honest, I have no clue. C++ code is  and this project is
              (more or less) unprecedented. (Which is, again, why I am interested in it.)
            The reasons why I believe it  be technically feasible at all are simple:
                Carbon doesn’t attempt to do the impossible: The goal is a tool-assisted migration of idiomatic code,
                not a fully automated migration of  code. (What does ‘idiomatic’ mean? Who knows. Probably
                something like ‘well-annotated and easy to handle for static analyzers’. Figuring out how to draw the
                boundary of which code can be migrated is part of the project.)
              
                Carbon is capable of leveraging its underlying tooling to do a  of the hard work. For
                example, resolving C++ templates and function calls is handled by Clang and LLVM. This should not be
                much of a surprise. Clang can be used as a library, and this is exactly what you’d expect it to excel
                at. (Swift is
                already doing this for its C++ interop.)
              
                Carbon already demonstrated that its chosen abstractions are capable of supporting some pretty “fun” C++
                features.
              Let me quickly substantiate some of that.
              So, here’s the thing. Carbon can
              convert your C++ to Carbon and then run it against the old test suite. (Or that’s the plan, at
              least.)
            (You do have a test suite, right?)
              If the code compiles and all tests pass, this should give you confidence in the resulting code
              proportional to your confidence in your own test suite. (This is especially helpful for changes
               the initial automated migration, even if it’s just clean-up work.)
            This approach is  for all sorts of reasons.
              First of all, it means that Carbon can leverage
              existing C++ test suites to test its own migration and interop capabilities. This is great.
            
              Second of all, it puts  burden on the user and sets a minimal bar for what Carbon means with
              ‘migration of idiomatic C++’: You should  have some tests in your code. If you critically
              depend on something, then you should have a test for it.
            Generalization and unification of C++ features
              If you have no idea what you’re looking at: This is legal C++. Calling  a ‘pointer’ is a
              stretch, in practice it is just an  relative to the location of an object of this class in
              memory.
            
              Two funfacts: First, this can also be used to refer to methods. Second, this value can be null, and it’s
              null-value is , since  would point to an actual field.
            
              When I see a feature like this, my first question would be whether Carbon is even capable of
               this specific type of behavior, and it turns out that, yes, they have thought about
              this.
            
              Carbon is building  on top of  (which can broadly be
              understood as C++0x Concepts or Rust traits).
            
              There’s a simple reason for that: Carbon wants to support  checked generics
              (roughly, you’ll know that a generic function can be instantiated without having to look into the body of
              the function. This is not the case for templates.) As a consequence,  which
              you can “do” with a value needs to be implemented as an interface, so that you can specify that an
              incoming value fulfills this constraint.
            
              Consequently,  are implemented via a so-called
               interface, which (as far as I can tell) generalizes expressions of the form
              , whether  is a field, a static member function, a method, a member access
              pointer, or who knows what else. Any  which implements  (where
               is the class of ) can be used as .
            
              The pattern of unifying abstractions as interfaces gets used a lot: It turns out that deep within Carbon,
              function calls are implemented as a synthesized type which implements some  interface.
              This is used to unify functions, methods, lambdas, etc. Every single thing in Carbon which you can “call”
              is just some value implementing the  interface.
            
              Sorry, I’m basically just rehashing parts of Chandler Carruth’s (highly technical) talk here. For the full
              picture, please just go and watch it. He’s a great speaker, and I don’t trust myself to get every
              technical detail right.
            
              The point is, if you’re wondering what the Carbon people are working on, then it’s this kind of stuff.
              They’re building  which are general enough to to make all sorts of gnarly C++
              semantics (eg. member access pointers) work, but have a  simpler underlying model. (eg. it
              unifies everything that can be called,  gives you the ‘concept’/interface for free).
            
              Is this going to work for the rest of the language? Who knows! C++ is complicated, probably too
              complicated to manage. That’s the whole reason why Carbon even exists.
            Digression: Why not Rust™? Why not C++?
              Rust is really just too different for an automated conversion of C++ code to Rust code to be feasible,
              it’s as simple as that. I even
              wrote an article
              getting into the differences in type inference alone.
            
              You have no class inheritance, no templates, no specialization, no ad-hoc function overloads, no implicit
              conversions, and there’s still the whole deal with the borrow checker. Any conversion of modern
              general-purpose C++ code to Rust basically amounts to a rewrite, which is just not something you can do
              with classic automation tooling.
            
              Carbon has the luxury of being able to support both templates  checked generics (ie. something
              like Rust traits or C++0x concepts), and a way to migrate between them.
            
              As for a C++-to-more-modern-C++-migration, it just doesn’t solve the question of language evolution.
              You’re still heavily limited by what you can do, unless you also commit to a proper fork of C++ and
              possibly Clang.
            
              Which…might be viable, but makes it much harder to implement clean abstractions from the get-go. It also
              doesn’t help that a fork runs a pretty severe risk of being ‘usable’ right from the get-go (meaning that
              people will want to use it, and the boundary between C++ and Carbon will be muddier).
            
              As I said, Carbon is a moonshot project to allow modern C++ codebases to evolve. (They might stop being
              called “C++” in the process, but that’s probably fine. The only constant in life is change, or something
              like that.)
            
              The north star goal is, of course, that of a gradual but mostly automated migration of existing C++ code
              to Carbon code, followed by  migrations to fix and improve this code using Carbon’s
              modern, more powerful semantics (eg. null safety).
            
              From this angle, and with the historical background in mind, let’s address the elephant in the room
              and take a stab at describing how some people feel about Carbon, by rephrasing my interpretation of its
              goals in the most cynical way possible. I’m deeply sorry to anyone who’s working on Carbon, since this is
              going to feel like I’m twisting a proverbial knife:
            
                Carbon’s primary goal is a large-scale migration of Google’s enormous pile of (highly specific,
                exception-less, Abseil and Protobuf-using, Clang-based, Bazel-built) C++ technical debt into a modern
                language capable of supporting Google’s needs, and
                over whose governance Google is capable of exerting a significant amount of control.
              There we go. Do
              you see the elephant yet?
            
              It’s pretty hard to miss since I highlighted it. (Sorry, I know that it’s the second time I made that
              joke.)
            
              This is about the least charitable way to phrase it, of course. I’m bringing this up for the obvious
              reasons: Carbon is spearheaded by a big tech company, and people have various concerns.
            
              These include the concern that Google trying to ’take control’ of C++ via a divide-and-conquer approach,
              that Carbon will favor Google’s style of C++ at the expense of others, and the classic sentiment that
              Carbon will eventually be abandoned and dropped (potentially hanging early adopters out in the dry).
            
              As I already gestured at before, all of this is about , and by extension about governance.
            
              As long as we’re willing to say that Carbon is about reducing the reliance on the C++ Standard Committee,
              it’s pretty clear that that governance-shaped hole has to be filled , and that someone (or
              some group of people) has to decide the future direction of the language.
            
              I’ll be honest, I can make no guarantees here. I am not working on Carbon, and the dynamics here are far beyond my scope.
            
              I can point out that Carbon is an Apache-licensed open source project,
              open for contributors right now, and that it has an explicit “The intent is that […] Carbon remains a community-driven project, avoiding
              situations where any single organization controls Carbon’s direction.”
              disclaimer
              in its FAQ, but that’s not going to convince you if you’re worried about bad intentions.
            
              So. What I  tell you is that I believe that putting governance of the language into the hands
              of the open-source community is critical for Carbon’s long-term success, and that Carbon’s developers
              understand this.
            
              Whether Carbon will find widespread adoption depends on whether  trust
              Carbon’s stewards to handle the language with enough responsibility that migrating their own C++ code to
              Carbon seems like a safe offer.
            
              This sort of trust is hard to establish as long as there’s a single owner,  if that
              owner is Google.
            
              Second: That Carbon finds any public adoption at all is also pretty important  the primary
              goal was just to use it purely within Google. This might come as a surprise, but it’s pretty simple:
              People who’re expected to use Carbon first need to learn Carbon. This is  easier
              when Google can rely on a broad ecosystem of tutorials, libraries and discussion boards outside of its
              intranet.
            
              So in other words, for Carbon to become successful, it’s critical that there’s a public community, and
              that enterprise users of C++  Carbon.
            These are huge incentives to push the language towards independent community ownership.
              Both of these points (trust by enterprise users and need for a public community) were
               for Go (which was also
              spearheaded by Google), primarily due to Go’s simplicity, the fact that there was far less competition in
              the programming language space when Go released, and the fact that it was a language for greenfield
              projects. (That is, it didn’t require convincing ancient C++ coders to perform a massive migration and
              rework their tool chain.)
            
              My understanding is that
              Carbon’s leads understand all of this, and want the project to be community driven. For now, that’s more than good enough for me. For a
              project this early in its life-cycle, it’s nice to see that they’re thinking about this at all, and have
              made an explicit commitment to community ownership.
            Conclusion: There is no free lunch.
              The prospect of building a  to C++—arguably single most important programming language
              currently in existence—sounds like it should be doomed to fail.
            
              I’ll repeat what I said before, and what should be common knowledge: C++ is an incredibly complex
              programming language. It’s under-annotated, has multiple implementations (governed by a 2000+ page ISO
              Standard document), carries four decades of technical baggage, is full of undefined behavior, and has a
              frequently abused Turing-complete quasi-code-generation meta-programming language built into it.
            
              All of that should make it near impossible to succeed C++. Complexity is in fact a form of job security.
              So why am I still relatively confident in Carbon’s potential?
            Simple, it’s mainly since the priorities look correct to me. Carbon understands that
                C++’s inability to evolve, modernize, deprecate, migrate and standardize is  critical issue
                which the language is facing today.
                You cannot improve on this without making concessions. This goes both ways: There is old C++ code which
                you will not be able to support. At the same time, there are C++ features which you  to
                support, whether you want to or not.
              
                This is a herculean task that requires a massive initial investment (a whole new programming language),
                and a complete rethinking of tooling, communication, software engineering and language development
                practices.
              
              The inability to evolve is an issue for people who’re just starting to learn C++, and who stumble into
              every single footgun that hasn’t been taken care of over the past thirty years.
            
              It’s an issue for people who care for high-quality code, readability or memory safety, and see no viable
              path towards getting their C++ codebase into that state.
            
              It’s an issue for committee and compiler contributors, who need to carefully consider how a new
              feature will interact with literally everything else the language already supports.
            
              You might disagree with that assessment. It might not be an issue . That’s
              fine. C++ (for a given version, anyway) will stay exactly as it is. It’s not going to go away anytime
              soon, and that’s a good thing. People depend on that. Critical infrastructure depends on that.
            
              As for myself, I am incredibly glad to see that  is trying to take this bull by the horns,
              and willing to face this charging billion lines-of-code mountain of complexity and technical debt head-on.
            
              At last but not at least just since it would be  if we (humanity, as a whole)
              could actually pull it off, and don’t need to pass tales warning people about the dangers of using
               across the generations.
            
              It might take a while, but that’s fine. This is a long-term project. It  to be a long-term
              project to make this work. Once you start thinking about it from that perspective, everything makes a lot
              more sense.
            
              Remember, those millions of lines of C++ code are not going to go away anytime soon. They’ll still be
              there in a few decades. It’s either a large-scale migration (in some form or another), or nothing.
            
              In the meantime, if you’re remotely interested, I’ll reiterate that I highly recommend Carbon’s talks, eg.
              this one.
            
              Writing this took significantly longer than expected. The total number of footnotes written and deleted is
              about forty.

Under the new rules, bitcoin is no longer considered "currency," though it remains "legal tender." Another change makes using bitcoin entirely voluntary. (Previously, the law mandated that businesses accept bitcoin for any goods or services they provided.) Additionally, bitcoin can no longer be used to pay taxes or settle government debts. The government is also stepping back from its involvement in Chivo Wallet, the state-backed digital wallet... 



The reforms come as part of a broader financial agreement between Bukele and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One of the conditions for a proposed $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility loan was that El Salvador mitigate "potential risks of the Bitcoin project." The IMF has been critical of the country's crypto policies since Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in 2021. "There are large risks associated with using Bitcoin as legal tender, especially given the high volatility of its price. We don't recommend it," the organization said in 2022. 


Despite these changes, the administration insists it remains committed to bitcoin. Milena Mayorga, El Salvador's ambassador to the United States, has said that El Salvador is still a "bitcoin country" and will maintain — and even expand — its bitcoin reserves. "You have to adapt to the current situation and this is the decision that was taken in the Assembly, but that does not mean that the country will stop having a bitcoin reserve," she explained.

The declared goal is to cut the wealth of billionaires in half within a decade."We believe there should not be any billionaires," the paper from party co-chair Jan van Aken states, before going on to outline a five-point plan designed to make this position a reality. What are the Left's new tax plans? The party proposes reintroducing Germany's "wealth tax" which was abolished after the Constitutional Court deemed it unconstitutional in 1995. This tax was not focusing on income, but on people's accrued wealth. The party proposes a sliding scale, 1% for fortunes in excess of €1 million ($1.03 million), 5% for those higher than €50 million, and 12% for those higher than €1 billion.Next, the party calls for a one-off fee for the richest 0.7% of citizens, starting at 10% for those with more than €2 million, and rising as high as 30% for larger sums. The party also aims for a higher inheritance tax for larger estates, and higher rates of income tax for top earners. This would include a 60% income tax on salaries above €250,000 and 75% for those over €1 million. Finally, capital gains taxes should no longer be a flat 25% fee, but rather should operate on a sliding scale like income tax depending on the extent of the gains on assets.Party co-leader van Aken draws parallels to new 'super-rich' US governmentWhen launching the new proposal, van Aken alluded to Donald Trump's new administration in the US. "The new government is made up of the super-rich and the right, who are doing everything to secure their fortune and their power," he said.In Germany, too, van Aken argued, the very wealthy used their fortunes to secure unreasonable political influence. The Left Party had been struggling in the polls in recent years amid the rise of the far-right AfD. While the Left Party draws political roots from the former socialist regime in the now-defunct GDR, this region is now a stronghold of the AfD. Left Party candidate calls German migration debate awful Edited by: Darko Janjevic]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump wants a deal for Ukraine’s natural resources as ‘payback’ in exchange for aid stopping Russia attack: envoy</title><link>https://nypost.com/2025/02/07/us-news/trump-wants-a-deal-for-ukraines-natural-resources-as-payback-in-exchange-for-aid-stopping-russia-attack-envoy/</link><author>/u/broc944</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 22:24:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump ends legal battle over Twitter ban</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/trump-ends-legal-battle-over-twitter-ban/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 22:17:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the company formerly known as Twitter appears to be over.

(Which makes this graphene "a promising building block for future quantum-computing devices.") 

And now "We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected..." a team of researchers reported this week in Nature. Hackaday explains that "Part of the problem has been that it is hard to make large pieces of multi-layer graphene. By creating two-ply pieces and using special techniques, an international team is finding that quantum geometry explains how graphene superconductors resist changes in current flow more readily than conventional superconductors." 


Or, as Science Alert puts it, "Forced to run a labyrinth of carbon atoms uniquely arranged in twisted stacks, electrons do some rather peculiar things."
Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada, the University of Washington and Johns Hopkins University in the US, and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan recently discovered a strange new state of matter in the dynamics of currents flowing through layers of graphene. 

The findings confirm predictions on how electrons ought to behave when squeezed into crystalline arrangements, and may contribute fresh ideas on how to achieve reliable approaches to quantum computing or reveal ways to develop room-temperature superconduction... Graphene has been increasingly seen as something of a wonder material over recent decades, its lattice of carbon atoms connected in a way that leaves spare electrons to leap about like tokens in a game of quantum checkers. Physicists have consistently bent the rules of this game, finding new and unusual ways to alter properties of resistance or coordinate into exotic states. For these reasons, graphene has become a perfect playground to search for clues on low-resistance conductivity or test the boundaries of various quantum effects. 

This week MIT research scientist Joel Wang (a co-lead on the study) said "There's a whole family of 2D superconductors that is waiting to be probed, and we are really just scratching the surface." New Scientist explores where their research could lead:

Why do cold thin sheets of carbon offer no resistance to electric currents? Two experiments are bringing us closer to an answer — and maybe even to practical room-temperature superconductors... Past experiments have shown that very cold stacks of two or three layers of graphene can superconduct, or perfectly conduct electricity without resistance and energy loss, if some of the sheets are rotated by a special angle. But why this happens remained mysterious... [B]oth teams had to innovate a setup where the tiny graphene flakes were exposed to microwaves while the researchers slowly varied properties like temperature, which must be kept very low for superconductivity to occur at all... 

"We are finding interesting laws which seem to emerge in both these material systems. Maybe what we are uncovering is something deeper," says [Harvard postdoctoral researcher Abhishek Banerjee]. Both teams are planning on performing similar experiments with other very thin superconductors.

              In case you’ve not heard of it,  is Google’s experimental
              open-source “C++-successor
              language”. As a very rough first approximation, think Objective-C/Swift, Java/Kotlin, C/C++, C++/Carbon.
              It is also frequently mentioned in the same breath as Herb Sutter’s Cppfront and Sean Baxter’s Circle (and
              Rust, surprise surprise).
            
              Like with any ‘successor language’, the overall goal includes (at the bare minimum) near-seamless
              interoperability, as well as  improvements over the original language.
              (Otherwise it can hardly be called a successor, duh.)
            
              If you’ve clicked on the article, you’re probably waiting for me to admit that I’m lying, and to tell you
              that (in fact) Carbon  a programming language.
            
              And yes, it’s true! Carbon is a programming language. (Or rather, it’s  to be a
              programming language. Carbon is an experimental project and hasn’t hit its 0.1 release milestone yet. The
              Carbon developers are very transparent about this.)
            
              But in my humble opinion, thinking of Carbon as a ‘programming language’ is kind of missing the point. Let
              me tell you how I think about Carbon, and why I think that it’s more interesting than most people give it
              credit for:
            
                Carbon is a concentrated experimental effort to develop tooling that will facilitate automated
                large-scale long-term migrations of existing C++ code to a modern, well-annotated programming language
                with a modern, transparent process of evolution and governance model.
              
              The entirety of Carbon (the language, as well as the project) is built around making this goal possible.
              (Disclaimer, I don’t speak for Carbon, take my words with a grain of salt.)
            In this post, I want to convince you of the following points:
                Carbon is a project to investigate the possibility of a large-scale reduction of C++ technical debt via
                automated code migration.
                Many so-called ‘successor languages’ are . They don’t make
                 an explicit goal, and generally build a layer of abstraction on top of
                or rely on their host language.
              
                All of this is downstream of Google’s disagreements with the C++ Standard Committee. In fact, while all
                of this is about reducing technical debt, it’s also about reducing the organizational costs involved in
                having to coordinate migrations and language evolution with the committee.
              Developing a new programming language is probably necessary to achieve the goals of the project.
              I’d like to bring special attention to the point about governance: This isn’t just a technical issue. It’s
              a governance issue. It’s a “We just straight-up disagree on the future direction of the C++ programming
              language.” sort of issue. I already went over these cultural disagreements in
              a previous post.
            
              (The astute reader will note that you can evolve and govern your own programming language however you
              want, without needing to deal with WG21 (aka the C++ Standard Committee, aka the authority that decides
              what C++ .))
            
              At this point I’d  to reach for the Herb Sutter “We must minimize the need to change existing
              code.” quote again,
              but I’ll instead just state the obvious:
            
              A large-scale migration to a different programming language is  paradigm. As far as
              changes to existing code go, it’s uncompromising. It’s an approach that’s only going to work for a subset
              of people, and in fact,
              Carbon’s goal document
              lists “We consider it a non-goal to support legacy code for which the source code is no longer available”.
            
              In other words, the language is not for everyone. That’s fine! I am still very interested in it. I care
              about Carbon since I believe that it’s trying to solve the hardest problem C++ is currently facing.
            
              This isn’t any  technical issue (there are many, many of those), no, and it’s not even a
              broad concern such as memory safety.
            
              It’s the problem of C++ slowly calcifying and struggling to modernize. It’s about ABI, about dozens of
              tools but no agreed upon standards, and it’s about backwards compatibility. It’s about allowing existing
              C++ code to , modernize and change, in spite of decades of technical debt, multiple
              implementations, and many different users with different expectations and requirements.
            This is, in other words, an , and a .
              If you believe that certain multi-million line C++ codebases are still going to exist in twenty years,
              then you should understand the business case for Carbon.
            A short lesson in history
              Let’s briefly summarize the backstory for those who haven’t kept track. You could (very roughly) say that
              Google is developing Carbon due to conflicts with WG21, and disagreements about the future of the C++
              language.
            
              What matters is that Google contributed to WG21 for many years, and that it has a vested interest in the
              future of the language, due to owning many,  million lines of C++ code. It’s hard to
              overstate how critical C++ is for Google’s infrastructure, and for modern technology in general.
            
              The short summary is that Google’s developers (not just Google’s, mind you) disagreed with other parts of
              the committee about the
              future direction of the C++ language. There are a lot of reasons for this, and
              a lot of ink has been spilled on the
              topic. Eventually, after trying to work with WG21 for many years, Google basically threw in the towel.
              (You cannot blame them. They tried hard, and the WG21 process is notoriously slow and frustrating.)
            
              At this point, a lot of people might think that the core disagreement between Google and WG21 was about
              ‘memory safety’, or something like that.
            
              The current memory safety hype is a pretty big deal for C++, but the ball was already rolling several
              years ago. All of this started with concerns about C++’s complexity
              and .
              It turns out that fixing certain issues would require backwards incompatible changes (bad!). Coordinating
              this across the entire C++ ecosystem would be more or less impossible.
            
              I’ll not get into the details and instead point at Chandler Carruth’s
              ‘There are no zero-cost abstractions’
              for an example: It pins down how first of all,  has a runtime overhead, and
              second of all, how fixing this would require an ABI-break and a language change.
            
              (That doesn’t mean Google doesn’t care about memory safety, of course. They do. But memory safety isn’t
              what started the whole conflict, even though it’s currently carrying the torch. That’s why memory safety
              is still relevant to all of this, especially since making C++ memory safe without compromising the vision
              of the standard committee looks more or less impossible.)
            Migration & Language Evolution
              First of all, that Carbon has  as one of its goals should be clear. The
              Carbon people are
              very explicit about this. It’s also a common theme in
              their talks.
            
              This is, first and foremost, about moving  from the “We mustn’t break existing code, so we
              had to squeeze in this new feature/syntax in some awkward way .” approach to language
              evolution. ( and the (proposed) reflection operator () are sending
              their regards.)
            
              This approach to language evolution kind of sucks. It’s not like the committee doesn’t
               the problem, or doesn’t  to evolve the language. The committee is not
              evil, and it’s not your enemy. C++ is just incredibly hard to evolve for all sorts of reasons, which would
              honestly justify an article on their own (ABI, multiple implementations and the committee process, no
              unified ecosystem, no editions or epochs system, no unified migration tooling, widespread dynamic linking,
              etc.)
            Carbon’s goal is to move away from that.
              How? Via automated tooling, a well-defined process of language evolution with clear guarantees, etc.
              Carbon is still highly experimental, so the details are still WIP. If I had to guess, I’d say they’re
              planning to follow in the footsteps of other modern languages. As an example, consider how Rust manages:
            
                Have a new ’edition’ every three years or so. Each edition is allowed to make certain breaking changes,
                but modules from separate editions can be compiled and linked together.
              
                Ship automated migration tooling with the language, which allows an automatic migration of code to the
                new edition whenever possible.
              
                If you want to eg. introduce a new keyword, you  it one edition ahead of time.
                Raw Identifier syntax
                allows migration and use of old code that still uses this keyword as an identifier.
              In contrast to this, I don’t think there’s any feasible roadmap to get C++ to this state.It’s only possible with an ecosystem split, and that’s exactly the point.
              Let me reiterate this. If there’s one thing you take from this article, it’s this here: The
               is to make it possible to take existing C++ code and to put it onto a path
              towards a modern, well-defined process for future evolution and changes.
            
              This is the point. If you want to be cynical, it’s about cutting the dependency on the standard committee,
              and it’s about allowing any forwards-looking, backwards-incompatible changes , without
              having to worry about someone else’s ancient binaries from the 80s.
            
              I just want to make clear that I believe that Carbon is radically different from
              Cpp2 (ie. Herb Sutter’s experimental
              project to evolve C++).
            
              The major difference is that Cpp2 tries to leverage the existing C++ language to its full extent, while
              Carbon tries to minimize its dependency on C++ wherever possible.
            
              Cpp2 takes the same approach C++ originally did: It transpiles its own code to the host language, and is
              thus deeply and intrinsically linked to it. It reuses the C++ standard library with all of its problems,
              it aims to maintain the C++ ecosystem instead of splitting it.
            
              Perhaps most importantly, Cpp2 also cannot go  than C++: It cannot directly interface with
              the compiler, since it’s written to be used by “any standard-compliant C++20 compiler”.
            
              It should be obvious that it’s basically impossible for Cpp2 to make meaningful reductions to C++’s
              technical debt. Yes, it can be “C++, except with better defaults and syntax.”, but that’s all it can
              feasibly be as long as full backwards compatibility is an explicit goal. Reducing C++’s technical debt on
              a deeper level is  for Cpp2.
            
              It  reduce the number of ways there are to initialize objects by simplifying syntax. It
               make any changes that would require an ABI-break, it cannot add null-safety to the
              language (eg.  can still be null,  can still be valueless), and
              it can’t prevent your code from blowing up in exciting ways due to lifetime issues.
              Carbon has the advantage that it  make these changes. (eg. Carbon is planning to move away
              from exceptions, in favor of treating errors as values.)
            
              Just to be clear, this is fine! I am not saying Cpp2 is bad, and I’m curious to see how the project
              develops. I am just highlighting that Carbon and Cpp2 are completely different projects with
              completely different scopes and goals.
            
              It is written by Herb Sutter, someone who very clearly  C++ as it is, and who wants to make
              it easier to use. It’s about having a new syntax, and making it  to apply best practices
              to your C++ code.
            
              This is a great idea, and a much less invasive proposal than Carbon. Carbon isn’t that. Carbon is about
              reworking the language from the ground up. It’s about building a  language that can
              support almost all of the same semantics, but is still critically different. It’s about reworking the
              fundamentals, and building stronger abstractions.
            
              So in short, Cpp2 works  C++, and Carbon is trying to  a better C++ from
              scratch, while cutting its dependency on C++ almost completely.
            
              Is Carbon feasible? I’ll be honest, I have no clue. C++ code is  and this project is
              (more or less) unprecedented. (Which is, again, why I am interested in it.)
            The reasons why I believe it  be technically feasible at all are simple:
                Carbon doesn’t attempt to do the impossible: The goal is a tool-assisted migration of idiomatic code,
                not a fully automated migration of  code. (What does ‘idiomatic’ mean? Who knows. Probably
                something like ‘well-annotated and easy to handle for static analyzers’. Figuring out how to draw the
                boundary of which code can be migrated is part of the project.)
              
                Carbon is capable of leveraging its underlying tooling to do a  of the hard work. For
                example, resolving C++ templates and function calls is handled by Clang and LLVM. This should not be
                much of a surprise. Clang can be used as a library, and this is exactly what you’d expect it to excel
                at. (Swift is
                already doing this for its C++ interop.)
              
                Carbon already demonstrated that its chosen abstractions are capable of supporting some pretty “fun” C++
                features.
              Let me quickly substantiate some of that.
              So, here’s the thing. Carbon can
              convert your C++ to Carbon and then run it against the old test suite. (Or that’s the plan, at
              least.)
            (You do have a test suite, right?)
              If the code compiles and all tests pass, this should give you confidence in the resulting code
              proportional to your confidence in your own test suite. (This is especially helpful for changes
               the initial automated migration, even if it’s just clean-up work.)
            This approach is  for all sorts of reasons.
              First of all, it means that Carbon can leverage
              existing C++ test suites to test its own migration and interop capabilities. This is great.
            
              Second of all, it puts  burden on the user and sets a minimal bar for what Carbon means with
              ‘migration of idiomatic C++’: You should  have some tests in your code. If you critically
              depend on something, then you should have a test for it.
            Generalization and unification of C++ features
              If you have no idea what you’re looking at: This is legal C++. Calling  a ‘pointer’ is a
              stretch, in practice it is just an  relative to the location of an object of this class in
              memory.
            
              Two funfacts: First, this can also be used to refer to methods. Second, this value can be null, and it’s
              null-value is , since  would point to an actual field.
            
              When I see a feature like this, my first question would be whether Carbon is even capable of
               this specific type of behavior, and it turns out that, yes, they have thought about
              this.
            
              Carbon is building  on top of  (which can broadly be
              understood as C++0x Concepts or Rust traits).
            
              There’s a simple reason for that: Carbon wants to support  checked generics
              (roughly, you’ll know that a generic function can be instantiated without having to look into the body of
              the function. This is not the case for templates.) As a consequence,  which
              you can “do” with a value needs to be implemented as an interface, so that you can specify that an
              incoming value fulfills this constraint.
            
              Consequently,  are implemented via a so-called
               interface, which (as far as I can tell) generalizes expressions of the form
              , whether  is a field, a static member function, a method, a member access
              pointer, or who knows what else. Any  which implements  (where
               is the class of ) can be used as .
            
              The pattern of unifying abstractions as interfaces gets used a lot: It turns out that deep within Carbon,
              function calls are implemented as a synthesized type which implements some  interface.
              This is used to unify functions, methods, lambdas, etc. Every single thing in Carbon which you can “call”
              is just some value implementing the  interface.
            
              Sorry, I’m basically just rehashing parts of Chandler Carruth’s (highly technical) talk here. For the full
              picture, please just go and watch it. He’s a great speaker, and I don’t trust myself to get every
              technical detail right.
            
              The point is, if you’re wondering what the Carbon people are working on, then it’s this kind of stuff.
              They’re building  which are general enough to to make all sorts of gnarly C++
              semantics (eg. member access pointers) work, but have a  simpler underlying model. (eg. it
              unifies everything that can be called,  gives you the ‘concept’/interface for free).
            
              Is this going to work for the rest of the language? Who knows! C++ is complicated, probably too
              complicated to manage. That’s the whole reason why Carbon even exists.
            Digression: Why not Rust™? Why not C++?
              Rust is really just too different for an automated conversion of C++ code to Rust code to be feasible,
              it’s as simple as that. I even
              wrote an article
              getting into the differences in type inference alone.
            
              You have no class inheritance, no templates, no specialization, no ad-hoc function overloads, no implicit
              conversions, and there’s still the whole deal with the borrow checker. Any conversion of modern
              general-purpose C++ code to Rust basically amounts to a rewrite, which is just not something you can do
              with classic automation tooling.
            
              Carbon has the luxury of being able to support both templates  checked generics (ie. something
              like Rust traits or C++0x concepts), and a way to migrate between them.
            
              As for a C++-to-more-modern-C++-migration, it just doesn’t solve the question of language evolution.
              You’re still heavily limited by what you can do, unless you also commit to a proper fork of C++ and
              possibly Clang.
            
              Which…might be viable, but makes it much harder to implement clean abstractions from the get-go. It also
              doesn’t help that a fork runs a pretty severe risk of being ‘usable’ right from the get-go (meaning that
              people will want to use it, and the boundary between C++ and Carbon will be muddier).
            
              As I said, Carbon is a moonshot project to allow modern C++ codebases to evolve. (They might stop being
              called “C++” in the process, but that’s probably fine. The only constant in life is change, or something
              like that.)
            
              The north star goal is, of course, that of a gradual but mostly automated migration of existing C++ code
              to Carbon code, followed by  migrations to fix and improve this code using Carbon’s
              modern, more powerful semantics (eg. null safety).
            
              From this angle, and with the historical background in mind, let’s address the elephant in the room
              and take a stab at describing how some people feel about Carbon, by rephrasing my interpretation of its
              goals in the most cynical way possible. I’m deeply sorry to anyone who’s working on Carbon, since this is
              going to feel like I’m twisting a proverbial knife:
            
                Carbon’s primary goal is a large-scale migration of Google’s enormous pile of (highly specific,
                exception-less, Abseil and Protobuf-using, Clang-based, Bazel-built) C++ technical debt into a modern
                language capable of supporting Google’s needs, and
                over whose governance Google is capable of exerting a significant amount of control.
              There we go. Do
              you see the elephant yet?
            
              It’s pretty hard to miss since I highlighted it. (Sorry, I know that it’s the second time I made that
              joke.)
            
              This is about the least charitable way to phrase it, of course. I’m bringing this up for the obvious
              reasons: Carbon is spearheaded by a big tech company, and people have various concerns.
            
              These include the concern that Google trying to ’take control’ of C++ via a divide-and-conquer approach,
              that Carbon will favor Google’s style of C++ at the expense of others, and the classic sentiment that
              Carbon will eventually be abandoned and dropped (potentially hanging early adopters out in the dry).
            
              As I already gestured at before, all of this is about , and by extension about governance.
            
              As long as we’re willing to say that Carbon is about reducing the reliance on the C++ Standard Committee,
              it’s pretty clear that that governance-shaped hole has to be filled , and that someone (or
              some group of people) has to decide the future direction of the language.
            
              I’ll be honest, I can make no guarantees here. I am not working on Carbon, and the dynamics here are far beyond my scope.
            
              I can point out that Carbon is an Apache-licensed open source project,
              open for contributors right now, and that it has an explicit “The intent is that […] Carbon remains a community-driven project, avoiding
              situations where any single organization controls Carbon’s direction.”
              disclaimer
              in its FAQ, but that’s not going to convince you if you’re worried about bad intentions.
            
              So. What I  tell you is that I believe that putting governance of the language into the hands
              of the open-source community is critical for Carbon’s long-term success, and that Carbon’s developers
              understand this.
            
              Whether Carbon will find widespread adoption depends on whether  trust
              Carbon’s stewards to handle the language with enough responsibility that migrating their own C++ code to
              Carbon seems like a safe offer.
            
              This sort of trust is hard to establish as long as there’s a single owner,  if that
              owner is Google.
            
              Second: That Carbon finds any public adoption at all is also pretty important  the primary
              goal was just to use it purely within Google. This might come as a surprise, but it’s pretty simple:
              People who’re expected to use Carbon first need to learn Carbon. This is  easier
              when Google can rely on a broad ecosystem of tutorials, libraries and discussion boards outside of its
              intranet.
            
              So in other words, for Carbon to become successful, it’s critical that there’s a public community, and
              that enterprise users of C++  Carbon.
            These are huge incentives to push the language towards independent community ownership.
              Both of these points (trust by enterprise users and need for a public community) were
               for Go (which was also
              spearheaded by Google), primarily due to Go’s simplicity, the fact that there was far less competition in
              the programming language space when Go released, and the fact that it was a language for greenfield
              projects. (That is, it didn’t require convincing ancient C++ coders to perform a massive migration and
              rework their tool chain.)
            
              My understanding is that
              Carbon’s leads understand all of this, and want the project to be community driven. For now, that’s more than good enough for me. For a
              project this early in its life-cycle, it’s nice to see that they’re thinking about this at all, and have
              made an explicit commitment to community ownership.
            Conclusion: There is no free lunch.
              The prospect of building a  to C++—arguably single most important programming language
              currently in existence—sounds like it should be doomed to fail.
            
              I’ll repeat what I said before, and what should be common knowledge: C++ is an incredibly complex
              programming language. It’s under-annotated, has multiple implementations (governed by a 2000+ page ISO
              Standard document), carries four decades of technical baggage, is full of undefined behavior, and has a
              frequently abused Turing-complete quasi-code-generation meta-programming language built into it.
            
              All of that should make it near impossible to succeed C++. Complexity is in fact a form of job security.
              So why am I still relatively confident in Carbon’s potential?
            Simple, it’s mainly since the priorities look correct to me. Carbon understands that
                C++’s inability to evolve, modernize, deprecate, migrate and standardize is  critical issue
                which the language is facing today.
                You cannot improve on this without making concessions. This goes both ways: There is old C++ code which
                you will not be able to support. At the same time, there are C++ features which you  to
                support, whether you want to or not.
              
                This is a herculean task that requires a massive initial investment (a whole new programming language),
                and a complete rethinking of tooling, communication, software engineering and language development
                practices.
              
              The inability to evolve is an issue for people who’re just starting to learn C++, and who stumble into
              every single footgun that hasn’t been taken care of over the past thirty years.
            
              It’s an issue for people who care for high-quality code, readability or memory safety, and see no viable
              path towards getting their C++ codebase into that state.
            
              It’s an issue for committee and compiler contributors, who need to carefully consider how a new
              feature will interact with literally everything else the language already supports.
            
              You might disagree with that assessment. It might not be an issue . That’s
              fine. C++ (for a given version, anyway) will stay exactly as it is. It’s not going to go away anytime
              soon, and that’s a good thing. People depend on that. Critical infrastructure depends on that.
            
              As for myself, I am incredibly glad to see that  is trying to take this bull by the horns,
              and willing to face this charging billion lines-of-code mountain of complexity and technical debt head-on.
            
              At last but not at least just since it would be  if we (humanity, as a whole)
              could actually pull it off, and don’t need to pass tales warning people about the dangers of using
               across the generations.
            
              It might take a while, but that’s fine. This is a long-term project. It  to be a long-term
              project to make this work. Once you start thinking about it from that perspective, everything makes a lot
              more sense.
            
              Remember, those millions of lines of C++ code are not going to go away anytime soon. They’ll still be
              there in a few decades. It’s either a large-scale migration (in some form or another), or nothing.
            
              In the meantime, if you’re remotely interested, I’ll reiterate that I highly recommend Carbon’s talks, eg.
              this one.
            
              Writing this took significantly longer than expected. The total number of footnotes written and deleted is
              about forty.

Volkswagen has teased plans for a "China-killer" electric vehicle that will cost just €20,000 ($20,664 USD or £16,700) as the German carmaker gears up to take on a flood of Beijing-backed low-cost rivals. The company on Thursday shared its first images of a new vehicle expected to be called the ID.1, which will go into production from 2027. 

The low-cost EV is intended to go head to head with all-electric brands from Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which overtook Tesla in British sales for the first time last month. Previous images of the vehicle suggest it will be an electric hatchback. Thomas Schäfer, the VW chief executive, said the new model would be "an affordable, high-quality, profitable electric Volkswagen from Europe, for Europe". Quentin Willson, the motoring journalist and founder of FairCharge, said the car could be a "possible China EV killer". Dan Caesar, of Electric Vehicles UK, added: "Cheaper EVs are exactly what legacy auto-makers need to be competitive during this critical time. We would expect the ID.1 to be warmly welcomed by motorists." Ginny Buckley, of consumer advice website Electrifying, said Volkswagen had been "clear about its intent to compete with China's low-cost EVs"... 

The German carmaker is planning to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030 as it grapples with stalled demand for EVs in Europe and growing competition from Chinese rivals. 
Volkswagen executives describe the upcoming EV will be a "true Volkswagen for everyone," according to the article 
It also notes that the number of EVs sold across Europe "fell by 3% to 3 million during 2024, according to data from analysts Rho Motion."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple’s new research robot takes a page from Pixar’s playbook</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/apples-new-research-robot-takes-a-page-from-pixars-playbook/</link><author>Brian Heater</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 21:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month, Apple offered up more insight into its consumer robotics work via a research paper that argues that traits like expressive movements are key to optimizing human-robot interaction. “Like most animals,” starts the report, “humans are highly sensitive to motion and subtle changes in movement.” To illustrate its point, Apple pays homage to Pixar, […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

The ecosystem launches with Partnr Chat, an app that turns AI agents into active participants in users' everyday lives, and Partnr Vaults, a platform that tokenizes strategies for both user and agent-owned DeFi vaults.\
Partnr’s ecosystem focuses on agent enablement, a key category at the intersection of crypto and AI as more agent frameworks and AI agents are launched each day. By creating products that help agents create real value and impact for consumers, Partnr connects the dots between the rapidly growing on-chain agent space and the need for more consumer crypto products.“Partnr is a blueprint for how consumer crypto and AI intersect,” said Corey Wilton, CEO of Partnr. “Both crypto and AI still have room to grow when it comes to consumer awareness and user experience. Partnr is building products that compete with the best consumer UI/UX while simultaneously developing infrastructure for agents to build value for their creators.”\
In Partnr Chat, users can form meaningful connections with AI agent companions that adapt and evolve over time using shared memory to recall past exchanges and deliver increasingly personalized experiences. Crucially, Partnr Chat’s AI Agents are more than passive companions: they are independent entities capable of managing on-chain wallets, and can be created with their own long-term goals and intentions. User interactions refine and shape the agents, and in the future, Partnr will support user-created Agents within the Chat framework.\
Partnr Vaults allows both users and agents to create powerful tokenized DeFi vaults. Vaults can represent complex DeFi strategies or act as escrows for users and agents to manage funds for depositors while earning a performance fee. Vaults extends the ecosystem’s potential by equipping users with tools to deploy AI agents within decentralized AI finance (DeFAI) application.Partnr’s approach to blending consumer product surfaces with on-chain agent compatibility is unique in consumer AI applications.“Partnr is leading at the intersection of innovation and utility,” said Steve Nguyen, co-founder and CTO of Partnr. “By enabling AI agents to perform automated on-chain tasks with shared memory and long-term learning, we’re giving creators and users the tools they need to experience a whole new range of Web3 applications.”\
Partnr’s lightweight, web-based design ensures global accessibility, making consumer AI products available to users worldwide. By removing barriers to entry, Partnr is creating a platform that prioritizes inclusivity and broad adoption.Partnr CEO Corey Wilton added: "Accessibility is at the heart of what we’re building. We’re committed to making both consumer crypto and consumer AI products available to anyone, anywhere, while maintaining the high standards of performance and security that Web3 demands.”\
Partnr is positioned to lead the next wave of AI Agent-driven Web3 innovation. The world of Partnr is just getting started, and its ecosystem of consumer AI products will only grow. To explore the Partnr ecosystem, users can visit . is a groundbreaking Web3 AI agent ecosystem that bridges meaningful interactions with practical AI applications. By introducing tools like Partnr Chat for dynamic engagement and Partnr Vaults for on-chain execution, Partnr empowers users and creators to unlock the full potential of AI in decentralized contexts. The ecosystem is built with accessibility, innovation, and user empowerment at its core, redefining how people interact with AI across Web3 and beyond.:::tip

Last weekend Donald Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 per cent levy on imports from China. Canadian oil was hit at a lower rate of 10 per cent. The duties will take effect from Tuesday. Just days later these tariffs were suspended.

Trump said the actions were in response to the “major threat” posed by the flow of migrants and drugs into the US across its borders with Canada and Mexico.

Those hints "left collectors and free software fans wondering which of the pieces of the FSF's history would be auctioned off." 

But Tuesday the FSF "lifted the veil and gave a sneak peak of some of the more prestigious entries in the memorabilia auction."

First of all, the memorabilia auction will feature an item that could be especially interesting for art collectors but will certainly also draw the attention of free software fans from all over: the original GNU head drawing by Etienne Suvasa, which became the blueprint for the iconic GNU logo present everywhere in the free software world. 

The list of memorabilia for sale also entails some rare and historic hardware, such as a "terminus-est" microcomputer, and an Amiga 3000UX that was used in the FSF's old office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early days of GNU, when these machines were capable of running a GNU-like operating system. Another meaningful item to be auctioned off, and one that collectors will want to keep a keen eye on, is the Internet Hall of Fame medal awarded to founder Richard Stallman. When Stallman was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame, it was the ultimate recognition of free software's immense impact on the development and advancement of the Internet. This medal is definitely worthy of joining a fine historical collection...! [T]here are several more historic awards, more original GNU artwork, and a legendary katana [as seen in an XKCD comic] that became a lighthearted weapon in the fight for computer user freedom. 

The auction is only the opening act to a whole agenda of activities celebrating forty years of free software activism. In May, the FSF invites free software supporters all over the world to gather for local in-person community meetups to network, discuss what people can do next to make the world freer, and celebrate forty years of commitment to software freedom. Then, on the actual birthday of the FSF on October 4, 2025, the organization intends to bring the international free software community to Boston for a celebration featuring keynotes and workshops by prominent personalities of the free software movement. 
"The bidding will start as a virtual silent auction on March 17 and run through March 21, with more auction items revealed each day, and will culminate in an virtual live auction on March 23, 2025, 14:00 to 17:00 EDT," according to the announcement. 
"Register here to attend the live auction. There's no need to register for the silent auction; you can simply join the bidding on the FSF's LibrePlanet wiki."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tips for mathematical handwriting (2007)</title><link>https://johnkerl.org/doc/ortho/ortho.html</link><author>susam</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 19:20:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that you’re majoring in one of the technical disciplines
(engineering, science, or math), you’re going to be spending a
significant amount of time communicating in writing with others.  You may find
that previously unimportant details, such as crossing your ’s,
now become essential — not only so that others can understand you, but
also so that you can avoid mistaking your own 2 for
 and so on.  This is especially important if your
handwriting (like mine!) is less than perfect.

Before I continue, take a fresh look at our Roman alphabet, the digits, and
the Greek alphabet:

Notice that these mechanically typeset symbols are all clear and distinct
(except that lowercase omicron and most of the uppercase Greek letters look
like Roman letters — we don’t use these “duplicates”).

 When we write by hand, though, symbols can become ambiguous —
we’re not machines, and things get a little loopy when we hurry.  In
prose, surrounding letters can disambiguate a questionable letter — e.g.
you can guess that the fourth letter of  has to be an .
But in mathematical expressions we mix symbols from different alphabets, in
different orders, so context can’t assist us — and when we guess,
we often guess wrong.  So it now becomes very important that each letter be
clearly recognizable on its own merits.

Here are samples, followed by the points I consider most important.

More sophisticated attackers could also tamper with the data while it's in transit. Apple strongly encourages iPhone and iPad developers to enforce encryption of data sent over the wire using ATS (App Transport Security). For unknown reasons, that protection is globally disabled in the app, NowSecure said. Whatâ(TM)s more, the data is sent to servers that are controlled by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok... 

[DeepSeek] is "not equipped or willing to provide basic security protections of your data and identity," NowSecure co-founder Andrew Hoog told Ars. "There are fundamental security practices that are not being observed, either intentionally or unintentionally. In the end, it puts your and your company's data and identity at risk...." This data, along with a mix of other encrypted information, is sent to DeepSeek over infrastructure provided by Volcengine a cloud platform developed by ByteDance. While the IP address the app connects to geo-locates to the US and is owned by US-based telecom Level 3 Communications, the DeepSeek privacy policy makes clear that the company "store[s] the data we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China...." US lawmakers began pushing to immediately ban DeepSeek from all government devices, citing national security concerns that the Chinese Communist Party may have built a backdoor into the service to access Americans' sensitive private data. If passed, DeepSeek could be banned within 60 days.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk said he’s not interested in acquiring TikTok</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/elon-musk-said-hes-not-interested-in-acquiring-tiktok/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk recently said he is “not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok.” Musk made those remarks during an interview at the WELT Economic Summit on January 28.

The latest rallies came after an estimated 160,000 people marched in Berlin last weekend to protest recent overtures by Germany's conservatives to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of fraught elections this month.Munich police initially put the turnout for the latest demonstration, dubbed "Munich is multicolor," at 100,000 people, then upped their estimate to more than 200,000 shortly after it began.With legislative elections two weeks away, demonstrators rallied under the slogan "democracy needs you," warning against any party working together with the AfD.Germany has long had an unwritten rule against working with the far right, dating back to the aftermath of the horrors wrought by the Nazis in World War II.But protesters say the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the frontrunner for the February 23 vote, breached that so-called "firewall" by seeking the AfD's support in parliament for an anti-immigration bill.Organizers, who put the turnout at 320,000, said the Munich march aimed to send a "strong signal in favor of diversity, human dignity, cohesion and democracy". Protesters on Munich's famed Theresienwiese, a sprawling esplanade in the city center, carried placards attacking CDU leader Friedrich Merz, bearing messages such as "Shame on you!" Another protest in the northern city of Hanover drew 24,000 people, according to police.The CDU has ruled out forming a government with the AfD, which is polling in second place ahead of the elections.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada seeks stronger EU trade ties in face of Trump tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-seeks-stronger-eu-trade-ties-both-regions-threatened-by-trump-tariffs-2025-02-08/</link><author>/u/twotwo_twentytwo</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White House Moves to Halt Federal Funds for EV Charging Stations</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/08/0735240/white-house-moves-to-halt-federal-funds-for-ev-charging-stations?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thursday the White House "moved to halt a $5 billion initiative to build electric vehicle charging stations," reports Politico, "by instructing states not to spend federal funds previously allocated to them..." NPR described the move as "putting in limbo billions of dollars allocated to states with current and future projects..." 



Politico notes the move "appears to upend years of precedent in which federal promises of funds for highway projects had given states an all-but-guaranteed assurance that they were free to spend them. It also raises legal questions... Funding experts had told POLITICO last year that decades of legal precedent would largely insulate the charging money...

Andrew Rogers [deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, or FHWA, in the Biden administration] said in a text message that the new letter "appears to ignore both the law and multiple restraining orders that have been issued by federal courts." Rogers, who is now a senior vice president at Boundary Stone Partners, said the move appears to be "in direct violation" of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a Watergate-era law that prohibits presidents from unilaterally canceling congressionally approved spending. Trump has contended that the law is unconstitutional. 

Politico also got a quote from the chief analyst at analytics firm Paren, who predicts lawsuits from affected states and that the final impact of the move will be "just causing havoc and slowing things down for awhile."

[A letter to state transportation directors from the Federal Highway Administration] clarifies that states will be able to receive reimbursements for "existing obligations" to design and build stations "in order to not disrupt current financial commitments." According to the letter, FHWA plans to publish new draft guidance on the NEVI program in the spring, followed by a comment period, before issuing new final guidance. Only then will states be able to resubmit their annual implementation plans for all fiscal years of the program. 
"But that doesn't mean that the program is going to be sunset or the funds are not going to be made available again to the states," Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy consultancy told NPR:
Several experts tell NPR that as a result of its overwhelming bipartisan support at the time, attempts to overturn it within the executive branch are likely to be challenged in court. Nigro believes the funding will resume eventually... 
So far, 56 stations [with multiple chargers] are up and running as a result of the program, while more than 900 sites in total have been "awarded" to date, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, another research analytics firm. McDonald said several hundred of the awarded sites are currently under construction and expected to open this year. He does not believe the FHWA has the authority to pause or rescind any aspect of the NEVI program... "I assume lawsuits from states will start soon, and this will go to court and Congress," McDonald said in a statement. 

The move has "confounded states, which had been allocated billions of dollars by Congress for the program," the New York Times reported Friday. "[S]ome state officials said that as a result of the memo from the Trump administration, they had stopped work on the charging stations. Others said they intended to keep going." 

The Washington Post reports that a Texas Department of Transportation official "said it would continue to deploy federal funds for EV chargers until it receives further guidance," and that Ryan Gallentine, managing director at the national business association Advanced Energy United, said that states "are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement."


Politico adds:

Also on Thursday, FHWA took down several internet pages providing information on NEVI and its sister program, the $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program... Amid the confusion, at least six states — Alabama, Oklahoma, Missouri, Rhode Island, Ohio and Nebraska — have put their NEVI programs on hold, according to McDonald. Rhode Island and Ohio had been considered leading states in implementing the program.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SysVinit 3.14 Released: Overcomes Three Decade Limitation Of Inittab Line Length</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/SysVinit-3.14-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:33:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For those continuing to make use of SysVinit as the aging init system that in the Linux world has been largely replaced by systemd, SysVinit 3.14 is out today and overcomes a long-standing limitation around the length of lines within the inittab files...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Writing a simple windows driver in Rust</title><link>https://scorpiosoftware.net/2025/02/08/writing-a-simple-driver-in-rust/</link><author>ingve</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:25:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Rust language ecosystem is growing each day, its popularity increasing, and with good reason. It’s the only mainstream language that provides memory and concurrency safety at compile time, with a powerful and rich build system (cargo), and a growing number of packages (crates).My daily driver is still C++, as most of my work is about low-level system and kernel programming, where the Windows C and COM APIs are easy to consume. Rust is a system programming language, however, which means it plays, or at least can play, in the same playground as C/C++. The main snag is the verbosity required when converting C types to Rust. This “verbosity” can be alleviated with appropriate wrappers and macros. I decided to try writing a simple WDM driver that is not useless – it’s a Rust version of the “Booster” driver I demonstrate in my book (Windows Kernel Programming), that allows changing the priority of any thread to any value.To prepare for building drivers, consult Windows Drivers-rs, but basically you should have a WDK installation (either normal or the EWDK). Also, the docs require installing LLVM, to gain access to the Clang compiler. I am going to assume you have these installed if you’d like to try the following yourself.We can start by creating a new Rust library project (as a driver is a technically a DLL loaded into kernel space):We can open the booster folder in VS Code, and begin are coding. First, there are some preparations to do in order for actual code to compile and link successfully. We need a  file to tell cargo to link statically to the CRT. Add a  file to the root booster folder, with the following code:fn main() -> Result<(), wdk_build::ConfigError> {
    std::env::set_var("CARGO_CFG_TARGET_FEATURE", "crt-static");
    wdk_build::configure_wdk_binary_build()
}
(Syntax highlighting is imperfect because the WordPress editor I use does not support syntax highlighting for Rust)Next, we need to edit  and add all kinds of dependencies. The following is the minimum I could get away with:[package]
name = "booster"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[package.metadata.wdk.driver-model]
driver-type = "WDM"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
test = false

[build-dependencies]
wdk-build = "0.3.0"

[dependencies]
wdk = "0.3.0"       
wdk-macros = "0.3.0"
wdk-alloc = "0.3.0" 
wdk-panic = "0.3.0" 
wdk-sys = "0.3.0"   

[features]
default = []
nightly = ["wdk/nightly", "wdk-sys/nightly"]

[profile.dev]
panic = "abort"
lto = true

[profile.release]
panic = "abort"
lto = true
The important parts are the WDK crates dependencies. It’s time to get to the actual code in . We start by removing the standard library, as it does not exist in the kernel:Next, we’ll add a few  statements to make the code less verbose:use core::ffi::c_void;
use core::ptr::null_mut;
use alloc::vec::Vec;
use alloc::{slice, string::String};
use wdk::*;
use wdk_alloc::WdkAllocator;
use wdk_sys::ntddk::*;
use wdk_sys::*;
The  crate provides the low level interop kernel functions. the  crate provides higher-level wrappers.  is an interesting one. Since we can’t use the standard library, you would think the types like  are not available, and technically that’s correct. However,  is actually defined in a lower level module named , that can be used outside the standard library. This works because the only requirement for  is to have a way to allocate and deallocate memory. Rust exposes this aspect through a global allocator object, that anyone can provide. Since we have no standard library, there is no global allocator, so one must be provided. Then,  (and ) can work normally:#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL_ALLOCATOR: WdkAllocator = WdkAllocator;
This is the global allocator provided by the WDK crates, that use and to manage allocations, just like would do manually.Next, we add two  crates to get the support for the allocator and a panic handler – another thing that must be provided since the standard library is not included.  has a setting to abort the driver (crash the system) if any code panics:extern crate wdk_panic;
extern crate alloc;
Now it’s time to write the actual code. We start with , the entry point to any Windows kernel driver:#[export_name = "DriverEntry"]
pub unsafe extern "system" fn driver_entry(
    driver: &mut DRIVER_OBJECT,
    registry_path: PUNICODE_STRING,
) -> NTSTATUS {
Those familiar with kernel drivers will recognize the function signature (kind of). The function name is  to conform to the snake_case Rust naming convention for functions, but since the linker looks for , we decorate the function with the  attribute. You could use  and just ignore or disable the compiler’s warning, if you prefer.We can use the familiar  macro, that was reimplemented by calling , as you would if you were using C/C++. You can still call , mind you, but  is just easier:println!("DriverEntry from Rust! {:p}", &driver);
let registry_path = unicode_to_string(registry_path);
println!("Registry Path: {}", registry_path);
Unfortunately, it seems  does not yet support a , so we can write a function named  to convert a  to a normal Rust string:fn unicode_to_string(str: PCUNICODE_STRING) -> String {
    String::from_utf16_lossy(unsafe {
        slice::from_raw_parts((*str).Buffer, (*str).Length as usize / 2)
    })
}
Back in , our next order of business is to create a device object with the name “\Device\Booster”:let mut dev = null_mut();
let mut dev_name = UNICODE_STRING::default();
string_to_ustring("\\Device\\Booster", &mut dev_name);

let status = IoCreateDevice(
    driver,
    0,
    &mut dev_name,
    FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN,
    0,
    0u8,
    &mut dev,
);
The  function converts a Rust string to a :fn string_to_ustring<'a>(s: &str, uc: &'a mut UNICODE_STRING) -> Vec<u16> {
    let mut wstring: Vec<_> = s.encode_utf16().collect();
    uc.Length = wstring.len() as u16 * 2;
    uc.MaximumLength = wstring.len() as u16 * 2;
    uc.Buffer = wstring.as_mut_ptr();
    wstring
}
This may look more complex than we would like, but think of this as a function that is written once, and then just used all over the place. In fact, maybe there is such a function already, and just didn’t look hard enough. But it will do for this driver.If device creation fails, we return a failure status:if !nt_success(status) {
    println!("Error creating device 0x{:X}", status);
    return status;
}
 is similar to the  macro provided by the WDK headers.Next, we’ll create a symbolic link so that a standard  call could open a handle to our device:let mut sym_name = UNICODE_STRING::default();
let _ = string_to_ustring("\\??\\Booster", &mut sym_name);
let status = IoCreateSymbolicLink(&mut sym_name, &mut dev_name);
if !nt_success(status) {
    println!("Error creating symbolic link 0x{:X}", status);
    IoDeleteDevice(dev);
    return status;
}
All that’s left to do is initialize the device object with support for Buffered I/O (we’ll use  for simplicity), set the driver unload routine, and the major functions we intend to support:    (*dev).Flags |= DO_BUFFERED_IO;

    driver.DriverUnload = Some(boost_unload);
    driver.MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE as usize] = Some(boost_create_close);
    driver.MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CLOSE as usize] = Some(boost_create_close);
    driver.MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_WRITE as usize] = Some(boost_write);

    STATUS_SUCCESS
}
Note the use of the Rust  type to indicate the presence of a callback.The unload routine looks like this:unsafe extern "C" fn boost_unload(driver: *mut DRIVER_OBJECT) {
    let mut sym_name = UNICODE_STRING::default();
    string_to_ustring("\\??\\Booster", &mut sym_name);
    let _ = IoDeleteSymbolicLink(&mut sym_name);
    IoDeleteDevice((*driver).DeviceObject);
}
We just call  and , just like a normal kernel driver would. We have three request types to handle – , , and . Create and close are trivial – just complete the IRP successfully:unsafe extern "C" fn boost_create_close(_device: *mut DEVICE_OBJECT, irp: *mut IRP) -> NTSTATUS {
    (*irp).IoStatus.__bindgen_anon_1.Status = STATUS_SUCCESS;
    (*irp).IoStatus.Information = 0;
    IofCompleteRequest(irp, 0);
    STATUS_SUCCESS
}
The  is an  but it’s defined with a  containing  and . This seems to be incorrect, as  should be in a  with  (not ). Anyway, the code accesses the  member through the “auto generated” union, and it looks ugly. Definitely something to look into further. But it works.The real interesting function is the  handler, that does the actual thread priority change. First, we’ll declare a structure to represent the request to the driver:#[repr(C)]
struct ThreadData {
    pub thread_id: u32,
    pub priority: i32,
}
The use of  is important, to make sure the fields are laid out in memory just as they would with C/C++. This allows non-Rust clients to talk to the driver. In fact, I’ll test the driver with a C++ client I have that used the C++ version of the driver. The driver accepts the thread ID to change and the priority to use. Now we can start with :unsafe extern "C" fn boost_write(_device: *mut DEVICE_OBJECT, irp: *mut IRP) -> NTSTATUS {
    let data = (*irp).AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer as *const ThreadData;
First, we grab the data pointer from the  in the IRP, as we asked for Buffered I/O support. This is a kernel copy of the client’s buffer. Next, we’ll do some checks for errors:let status;
loop {
    if data == null_mut() {
        status = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
        break;
    }
    if (*data).priority < 1 || (*data).priority > 31 {
        status = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
        break;
    }
The  statement creates an infinite block that can be exited with a . Once we verified the priority is in range, it’s time to locate the thread object:let mut thread = null_mut();
status = PsLookupThreadByThreadId(((*data).thread_id) as *mut c_void, &mut thread);
if !nt_success(status) {
    break;
}
 is the one to use. If it fails, it means the thread ID probably does not exist, and we break. All that’s left to do is set the priority and complete the request with whatever status we have:        KeSetPriorityThread(thread, (*data).priority);
        ObfDereferenceObject(thread as *mut c_void);
        break;
    }
    (*irp).IoStatus.__bindgen_anon_1.Status = status;
    (*irp).IoStatus.Information = 0;
    IofCompleteRequest(irp, 0);
    status
}
The only remaining thing is to sign the driver. It seems that the crates support signing the driver if an INF or INX files are present, but this driver is not using an INF. So we need to sign it manually before deployment. The following can be used from the root folder of the project:signtool sign /n wdk /fd sha256 target\debug\booster.dll
The  uses a WDK test certificate typically created automatically by Visual Studio when building drivers. I just grab the first one in the store that starts with “wdk” and use it.The silly part is the file extension – it’s a DLL and there currently is no way to change it automatically as part of cargo build. If using an INF/INX, the file extension does change to SYS. In any case, file extensions don’t really mean that much – we can rename it manually, or just leave it as DLL. The resulting file can be installed in the “normal” way for a software driver, such as using the  tool (from an elevated command window), on a machine with test signing on. Then  can be used to load the driver into the system:sc.exe sc create booster type= kernel binPath= c:\path_to_driver_file
sc.exe start booster
I used an existing C++ application that talks to the driver and expects to pass the correct structure. It looks like this:#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

struct ThreadData {
	int ThreadId;
	int Priority;
};

int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) {
	if (argc < 3) {
		printf("Usage: boost <tid> <priority>\n");
		return 0;
	}

	int tid = atoi(argv[1]);
	int priority = atoi(argv[2]);

	HANDLE hDevice = CreateFile(L"\\\\.\\Booster",
		GENERIC_WRITE, 0, nullptr, OPEN_EXISTING, 0,
		nullptr);

	if (hDevice == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) {
		printf("Failed in CreateFile: %u\n", GetLastError());
		return 1;
	}

	ThreadData data;
	data.ThreadId = tid;
	data.Priority = priority;
	DWORD ret;
	if (WriteFile(hDevice, &data, sizeof(data),
		&ret, nullptr))
		printf("Success!!\n");
	else
		printf("Error (%u)\n", GetLastError());

	CloseHandle(hDevice);

	return 0;
}
Here is the result when changing a thread’s priority to 26 (ID 9408):Writing kernel drivers in Rust is possible, and I’m sure the support for this will improve quickly. The WDK crates are at version 0.3, which means there is still a way to go. To get the most out of Rust in this space, safe wrappers should be created so that the code is less verbose, does not have  blocks, and enjoys the benefits Rust can provide. Note, that I may have missed some wrappers in this simple implementation.You can find a couple of more samples for KMDF Rust drivers here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: FlashSpace – fast, open-source, macOS Spaces replacement</title><link>https://github.com/wojciech-kulik/FlashSpace</link><author>wojciech-kulik</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:19:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've recently launched a new open-source project aimed at enhancing the experience of switching between Spaces/workspaces on macOS.

From reading files from your database, to getting cache keys from Redis and augment them from content stored in your PostgreSQL.The use case we will focus on, is an automatic archival from PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL.-- Enable FDW   
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgres_fdw;-- Create a foreign server
CREATE SERVER postgres_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
   OPTIONS (host '{FOREIGN_HOST}', dbname '{FOREIGN_DB_NAME}');

-- Map local PostgreSQL user to foreign server credentials
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR postgres SERVER postgres_server
   OPTIONS (user '{FOREIGN_USERNAME}', password '{FOREIGN_PASSWORD}');You might be tempted to import foreign schema from the other postgres into the “public” schema of your current instance, however you can’t have 2 tables with the same name. That’s why, I would suggest you create a separate schema, you can call it foreign_schema or whatever you wish:-- Create a new schema to import the tables into
CREATE SCHEMA foreign_schema;

-- Import all tables from the foreign postgreSQL database
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public FROM SERVER postgres_server INTO foreign_scehma;

-- You can also import only specific tables
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public LIMIT TO ({TABLE1}, {TABLE2}) FROM SERVER postgres_server INTO foreign_schema;Now you can query your foreign database:SELECT * FROM foreign_schema.{TABLE1};The distant server is used as archive and the current db (the one you are connected to) is your live DB. CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (
    id uuid DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    amount INT DEFAULT 0,
    created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    PRIMARY KEY (id)
); CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE archive_old_transactions()  
LANGUAGE plpgsql  
AS $$  
BEGIN  
  -- Move data older than 1 year to archive  
  INSERT INTO foreign_schema.transactions  
  SELECT * FROM public.transactions  
  WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';  

  -- Delete archived data from main table  
  DELETE FROM public.transactions  
  WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';  
END;  
$$
;  -- Enable pg cron   
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;-- Run at 2 AM daily
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'archive_transactions',
  '0 2 * * *',
  'CALL archive_old_transactions()'
); CREATE VIEW combined_transactions AS (
    WITH remote_data AS (
      SELECT * FROM foreign_schema.transactions
    ),
    local_data AS (
      SELECT * FROM public.transactions
    )
    SELECT * FROM remote_data
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM local_data
);You will notice that I didn’t simply do a UNION of two tables, I used CTE (Common Table Expressions) because it is crucial for optimizing queries with foreign tables. Essentially, it containerizes the FDW query, because the query planner will have to ask the foreign database to execute its part, and the clearer this query is, the faster it will be.Containerize the FDW query to reduce data transferFilter data at the source Minimize the returned row count Nothing forces you to have the exact same copy of foreign and local table, neither you have to force foreign keys or equivalent indexes. It is probably recommended to create specific indexes in your foreign table that will match the query patterns they will be submitted to. Because you don’t query archive data the same way you might query live data. The concept of archival is often to reclaim space, but if you were to need faster access to data from both the archive and the live DB then you could use Materialized views to ensure fast queries. So if you query transactions from 2 years ago from now, until now. You necessarily have to query both tables.SELECT * FROM combined_transactions WHERE created_at BETWEEN(NOW() - INTERVAL '2 year', NOW()); PostgreSQL FDW transforms your database into a unified gateway for cross-database operations. By combining it with pg_cron and stored procedures, you can automate complex workflows like archival, reporting, and data synchronization without external tools.

Is our perception of reality just an illusion? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Gary O’Reilly explore the neuroscience behind magic with magician Teller (of Penn & Teller) and neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde.

We dive into the world of sensory perception, illusions, and the tricks magicians use to exploit the brain’s blind spots. How do our brains construct reality rather than simply perceiving it? Susana breaks down the science behind misdirection and cognitive illusions, revealing how our minds take shortcuts that magicians cleverly manipulate. Why haven’t we evolved to see through magic tricks? What role does survival play in shaping how we perceive the world?

What happens when you don’t notice changes right in front of you? We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?

We also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore.

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

The documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
In doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.
The documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‘start-up nation’ rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished.

(It opens with an absolutely gorgeous rendition of "Happy Days are Hear Again" played on a musical saw.) 

And somewhere in the festivities they announced the winners of this year's annual "Public Domain Day Film Remix Contest."


These remarkable films not only reimagined and transformed public domain works but also demonstrated the boundless potential of remixing creative works to create something new... Explore all 140+ submissions at the 2025 Public Domain Day Film Remix Contest collection at the Internet Archive... 

"The jury was deeply impressed by Queline Meadows's inspired mix of movies, images, music and text woven into a subtle and emotionally affecting video expressing a strong sense of nostalgia and the irretrievable passage of time," said film archivist Rick Prelinger... Filmmaker Samantha Close expresses both the breadth of 1929's production and the eternal bounty of the public domain, using images from 1929's films and public domain images from elsewhere and elsewhen. 

One honorable mention entry was described as "an audacious and yes, dopey exploration of the essential greatness of Internet Archive and the dread near-infinity of copyright."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can Chile or Germany develop the hydrogen-powered train tech of the future? | Transforming Business</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yygv3-c0ocw</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Yygv3-c0ocw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 16:30:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Chile wants to become the new superpower in the production of green hydrogen.

Aggressive managers aren’t easy. Working with them may leave you feeling overwhelmed, fill you with self-doubt and lower your self-worth.\
It is like running on a treadmill that just never stops.\
Just when you’re about to heave a sigh of relief, a new challenge is thrown your way. You dread coming to the office with the worry of what awaits you and how you’re barely going to make it through the day.\
Playing along with an aggressive manager by giving in to their demands not only wreaks havoc on your confidence, it makes you hate work you loved at first.The aggressive person fights. The passive one runs away. But the assertive person stands ground, assesses the situation, adapts, and acts with purpose and passion. Be that person.\
While aggressive managers are difficult, they aren’t impossible to work with. With the right strategies, you can turn them around while also learning valuable lessons along the way.Don’t mistake aggressiveness for toxicityAn aggressive manager is not bad news because they can help accelerate your career by enabling you to build skills that will serve you well throughout your career.\
They can teach you to handle high pressure situations well, stay resilient in the face of challenges and turn obstacles into opportunities.\
But it’s important to differentiate between a manager who cares about your growth from the one who only thinks of themselves.\
Do they challenge you, expect you to push boundaries and strive for excellence or do they display toxic behaviors such as shouting, manipulation, bullying, exploiting boundaries and other such harmful behaviors that are detrimental to your mental health and personal well-being?\
Aggression can sometimes be mistaken for toxicity especially if your manager’s expectations challenge you to step outside your comfort zone.\
Even if they mean well, their drive, determination and passion can be daunting at times.\
Managers who challenge you and push you to strive for excellence are hard to find. So, stop blaming, complaining and sobbing, and find ways to align with them on mutually agreeable goals.\
To do this, start with understanding what motivates them to be this way by digging deeper and taking note of their non-verbal cues (tone, voice, hand gestures, facial expressions):Is it their need to be in control?Do they tend to prioritize results over relationships?Do they usually come off as assertive, direct, and quick to make decisions?Do they tend to overrule others’ opinions because they want things done their way?Do they operate with a sense of urgency and expect efficiency in every interaction?\
Understanding the source of your manager’s aggression or specific behaviors they demonstrate can enable you to find ways to work with them instead of wasting time in resenting them or feeling sorry for yourself.Working with an aggressive manager can leave you feeling helpless, hopeless and out of control.\
Lack of control can make you adopt a self-defeating goal. You may:Respond to their aggression with aggression.Wallow in self-pity by feeling sorry for your situation without doing anything to improve your situation.Refuse to put in the effort with the mindset that it won’t be good enough.Give up when you hit a roadblock or are challenged to face unexpected situations.\
Desire to have more control at work while not taking the steps to regain that control can be one of the biggest hidden causes of  at work.\
Lack of control creates a cycle of avoidance, helplessness and discomfort which leads to further inaction and a self-fulfilling prophecy in your own beliefs.\
To feel in control, shift from circle of concern to circle of influence.\
Circle of concern includes things that you are concerned about but have no control over. Spending time and energy here can lead to feelings of inadequacy, helplessness and increased feelings of victimization.\
Circle of control includes things that you have direct control over and things that you may not completely control, but can influence in significant ways. Spending time and energy here can improve mental health, build resilience and promote overall well-being.\
For example, you cannot control what your manager says or does, but you can control how you react to them."Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their Circle of Influence to increase.\
  Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have no control. Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes, reactive language, and increased feelings of victimization. The negative energy generated by that focus, combined with neglect in areas they could do something about, causes their Circle of Influence to shrink.”\
Become proactive. Never stop believing in your ability to influence the outcome. Let go of things outside your control, shift your energy to things you can change or influence.While speaking to an aggressive manager, the words you choose play a crucial role in determining whether your manager listens to you or disregards your concerns.\
Using confrontational language or defensive arguments can trigger negative feelings which can intensify their aggression and make them turn against you.\
Also, saying things in a manner that challenges their authority or comes across as rude and disrespectful makes them much more likely to stick to their original argument even when they know you’re right and they’re wrong.\
Be mindful of your language to avoid escalating tension. Don’t:Use generalizing words like “always” and “never.” They are likely to cause more conflict.Use words that challenge their character like bad, demanding, rude.Pass judgment with words like mistake, failure, unacceptable.Accuse or blame them with things like “You’re wrong” or “It’s your fault.”Use a sarcastic or a confrontational tone.Pass statements that undermine their authority.Use emotionally charged language like ridiculous, absurd, pathetic, useless.Any attempt to attack, defend, or withdraw will work against you. Instead, you must restrain these reactive tendencies, find the courage to stand your ground, and then step forward in the face of this determined opposition.\
Use calm, neutral language. Show up with a confident tone of voice and positive body language. Speak in an unhurried way. Slowly and clearly state your concerns, opinions or whatever it is you need to say.\
Instead of: It’s impossible to do in this timeframe.\
Say: I have concerns about the suggested timelines to finish this project. While I understand the need to move fast, the reason we shouldn’t commit to them is because …\
Instead of: \
Say: I understand why you are leaning towards this option. It’s definitely highly beneficial to business. However, we also need to assess the risk and impact on business if it doesn’t work. Here’s why I think implementing this might be a challenge…When you come across as calm and confident to others, they respond in kind. It also ensures that your message is well received and not ignored as soon as it comes out of your mouth.Most aggressive managers lead with a strong opinion, which means they not only have a high regard for their ideas, but also appreciate those who seek them.\
When disagreeing with an aggressive manager or sharing your concerns, instead of ending with your thoughts, seek their opinion.\
Asking for their advice shifts their frame of mind from problem to solution. When put on the spot to answer a difficult question or make a difficult decision, they are more likely to be rational, less biased and may even agree with your opinion.\
You don’t have to please them in order to be liked or to get something from them. Be genuine when asking for advice because they can make out when you’re authentic and when you’re manipulating them to have it your way.Being nice is blocking you from standing up for yourself, being honest with others, creating deeper relationships, or boldly expressing yourself in the world.\
Frame your concerns or questions in a way that invites them to share their ideas without getting defensive.\
What’s your perspective on…?How would you deal with…?What would you do in this situation…?\
Getting your manager’s advice is a great way to redirect their thoughts in the direction you want. Even thinking momentarily about your question makes it more likely for them to lean towards your suggestions or the outcomes you want.Aggressive managers enjoy boundaryless freedom because it enables them to manipulate your time and energy in ways that suit them.\
Your personal boundaries involve setting limits and defining expectations on what you will and will not tolerate.\
Unspoken boundaries are often invisible—easy to violate as they’re based on each person’s own life experience. If your manager is aggressive, not setting boundaries is a recipe for disaster.\
Clearly laying out these boundaries is important because your manager can’t give you what you need unless you take the initiative and clearly communicate your priorities and expectations.\
To do this, communicate your needs by setting healthy boundaries and discussing them with your manager:What is non-negotiable—things you won’t compromise on. These if not met will significantly impact your well-being.What are some of the things you’re flexible about and willing to change if the situation demands it?What kind of responsibilities can you handle and what kind of tasks do not align with your goals?What are your limits—things you can realistically achieve.Setting boundaries inevitably involves taking responsibility for your choices. You are the one who makes them. You are the one who must live with their consequences. And you are the one who may be keeping yourself from making the choices you could be happy with.\
Setting boundaries will send a clear signal to your manager on what you will and will not tolerate. If your manager refuses to respect them, it might be time to quit. Anything that compromises with your mental well-being isn’t worth it.Working with an aggressive manager has pros and cons. On one hand, they can teach you valuable skills (resilience, negotiation, excellence) that can help you excel in your career. On the other hand, giving in to all their demands can make you exhausted, resentful and may even lead to burnout.Understanding your manager’s intent is important because it helps you identify if your manager’s aggression is aligned with the desire to help you learn, grow and excel or they only care about achieving outcomes without any regard for its impact on your career.The most likely feeling you develop when working with an aggressive manager is a sense of lack of control. You may feel like you have only two choices—either to agree to their demands or to quit. This thinking prevents you from finding productive ways to work with them. To develop a sense of control in difficult situations, shift from circle of control to circle of influence. Find out what you can do to influence their decision and what you must let go.When communicating your disagreement or voicing your concern, pay special attention to your words. How you speak to them plays a crucial role in determining whether your message is taken constructively or it’s misconstrued and then used in a negative way towards you.A great way to seek your manager’s attention is to ask for their advice.

The main reason is that I haven't worked in a development team for over six years. However, I'm now working for Loft Labs, and we have a Remote Development Environment product: DevPod. I wanted to understand our value proposition as I'll be at FOSDEM operating the DevPod booth.As a former developer, I vividly remember the pain of setting up each developer's development environment. At the beginning of my career, the architect had to configure my development machine painfully, so it was similar to his setup. Later on, I did the same for my team members repeatedly. The scope of possible discrepancies impacting development is virtually endless: Operating System, of course, version  flavor of the SDKs, , Java's Eclipse Temurin vs SapMachine, git hooks, etc. It was sweat, toil, and blood on every project.\
Over the years, I saw some interesting approaches to reproducing development environments. In the beginning, they stemmed from VMs, then from containers. I think Vagrant was the first tool that caught my attention: I attended a talk in 2012 where the speaker mentioned he used it to set up machines before his training sessions.\
App architectures have evolved significantly over the years, becoming more complex and sophisticated. Years ago, chances were that the only infrastructure dependency was a SQL database. In the JVM ecosystem, we were lucky to have JDBC, an API that would work across all SQL databases. All you needed to do was write standard SQL, and you could configure the database instance at runtime. With embedded databases such as Apache Derby and H2, you didn't need a dedicated Oracle instance for each developer.\
Times have changed. It's not uncommon for apps to need a SQL database, a NoSQL database, a Kafka cluster, and a few additional application services. Organizations that develop such apps are already using some container-related technology, , Docker or Kubernetes, to manage this complexity.\
It doesn't solve the initial issue, though: how do you align the IDE, its plugins, the SDK(s), the git hooks, and everything else? You probably guessed it from the title-Remote Development Environments.In the introduction, I mentioned that RDEs are called Cloud Development Environments. The main idea behind RDEs is to store all you can in a Cloud and share it with all developers. In addition, you want them to work across the most widespread Cloud providers and the most commonly used IDEs. When such a need appears, it's time for industry actors to gather around a standard. Microsoft initiated the Development Container standard for their VS Code Remove development plugin for this exact purpose.A development container (or dev container for short) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud, in a variety of supporting tools and editors.\
  The Development Container Specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option – so that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and testing. Beyond the specification's core metadata, the spec also enables developers to quickly share and reuse container setup steps through Features and Templates.\
The configuration file is . You can find the schema reference here. VS Code, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ products can leverage a  file. On the provider side, GitHub Codespaces, CodeSandbox, and DevPod suport it.DevPod is a solution that leverages . It implements three main properties:Open Source: No vendor lock-in. 100% free and open source built by developers for developers.Client Only: No server-side setup needed. Download the desktop app or the CLI to get started.Unopinionated: Repeatable dev environment for any infra, any IDE, and any programming language.\
DevPod is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward, making it a breeze to use. I decided to write this post because I was impressed with the product and to get my thoughts in order.\
The first step is to install DevPod itself. I'm on Mac; there's a Homebrew recipe.\
Once installed, you can launch it from the CLI or the GUI. I favor GUIs, in the beginning, to help understand the available options.\
DevPod offers providers: locations where to run the containers. The default is Docker. You can add additional providers, including Cloud Providers and Kubernetes clusters.\
For this post, I'll keep Docker—I'm using OrbStack. Now, onto the meat. Let's go to the workspaces menu item. If you already have created workspaces, they should appear here. Since it's our first visit, we shall create one. Click on the btn:[Create workspace] button. Let's try one of the quickstart examples, , Rust. My IDE of choice is IntelliJ IDEA, but you can choose yours. Once you've selected an image, an IDE, and a provider, click Create Workspace.\
At this point, DevPod will download the image and open the project running in OrbStack in IntelliJ.\
From now on, we can happily start working on our Rust project, confident that every team member uses the same Rust version.Note that the first time you use this setup, DevPod will download the JetBrains client as well. It's a one-time download delay, though.\
The same holds for Git pre-commit hooks, for example. If you prefer to develop within another IDE, select it at launch time, and you're good. When done with your day's work, stop the container. If you're running in the Cloud, it saves money. On the next day, resume the container and continue your work.DevPod is a nice tool around your toolbelt that allows your development team(s) to share the same machine configuration without hassle. In this introductory blog post, I showed a small fraction of what you can do. I encourage you to leverage its power if faced with heterogeneous development environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HackerNoon Decoded 2024: Celebrating Our Tech Stories Community!</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/hackernoon-decoded-2024-celebrating-our-tech-stories-community?source=rss</link><author>HackerNoon Decoded</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 16:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Tech Stories, You Found Inspiration To Build Your Next Big Thing\

Molly Roberts: Why have some companies decided finally that having offices full of employees is better for them? 

Heather Long: It's a loaded question, but I would say, unfortunately, 2025 is the year of operational efficiency, and that's corporate speak for save money at all costs. How do you save money? The easiest way is to get people to quit. What are these return to office mandates, particularly the five day a week in office mandates? We have a lot of data on this now, and it shows people will quit and you don't even have to pay them severance to do it. 

Molly Roberts: It's not about productivity for the people who are in the office, then, you think. It's more about just cutting down on the size of the workforce generally. 

Heather Long: I do think so. There has been a decent amount of research so far on fully remote, hybrid and fully in office. It's a mixed bag for fully remote. That's why I think if you look at the Fortune 500, only about 16 companies are fully remote, but a lot of them are hybrid. The reason that so much companies are hybrid is because that's the sweet spot. There is no productivity difference between the hybrid schedule and fully in the office five days a week. But what you do see a big difference is employee satisfaction and happiness and employee retention.... 
I think if what we're talking about is places that have been able to do work from home successfully for the past several years, why are they suddenly in 2025, saying the whole world has changed and we need to come back to the office five days a week? You should definitely be skeptical. 
"Who are the first people to leave in these scenarios? It's star employees who know they can get a job elsewhere," Long says (adding later that "There's also quantifiable data that show that, particularly parents, the childcare issues are real.") Long also points out that most of Nvidia's workforce is fully remote — and that housing prices have spiked in some areas where employers are now demanding people return to the office. 

But employers also know hiring rates are now low, argues Long, so they're pushing their advantage — possibly out of some misplaced nostalgia. "[T]here's a huge, huge perception difference between what managers, particularly senior leaders in an organization, how effective they think [people were] in offices versus what the rank and file people think. Rank and file people tend to prefer hybrid because they don't want their time wasted." 

Their discussion also notes a recent Harvard Business School survey that found that 40% of people would trade 5% or more of their salaries to work from home....]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Reality of Alzheimer&apos;s Research</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN3obqnV8tY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BN3obqnV8tY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:10:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The cost of caring for people with Alzheimer's in the United States is expected to increase to $1 trillion by 2060, but much of the research to find a cure is coming into question.

This Study Says Yes</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/can-3d-printing-improve-soundproofing-this-study-says-yes?source=rss</link><author>Labyrinthine</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[4 Rainbow AM labyrinthine panel5 Numerical evaluation of different labyrinthine sound absorption panel solutions3 Unit cell experimental and numerical characterizationIn order to validate the design predictions and experimentally assess the efficiency of the UC subwavelength sound wave absorption, we first perform normal incidence measurements on various types of UCs in an impedance tube. The UCs consist of a square cavity inside a solid cylinder, in which internal solid walls form a labyrinthine pattern. The UC samples for impedance tube measurements are manufactured in PLA using a Dremel Digilab filament 3D printer and in VeroYellow using a Stratasys J750 FDM 3D printer. The two polymers have similar mechanical characteristics, which are compatible with the rigid wall hypothesis used in simulations.\
The impedance tube setup is depicted in Fig. 4. The impedance measurements are performed in accordance with ISO 10534-2 [41] and ASTM E1050-19 [42] (two-microphone technique) regulations, in order to measure the normal incidence absorption coefficient (α0), calculated for a normally impinging pressure wave [43]. Measurements are performed using a HW-ACT-TUBE and -STL (Siemens, Munich, Germany), which has a diameter of 35 mm and is equipped with two 1/4 " flush mounted GRAS 46BD microphones (GRAS, Holte, Denmark) and a white noise source, i.e., a 2" aluminium driver. The method allows to obtain accurate sound pressure amplitude and phase measurements in the whole frequency range of interest, i.e., 100-5000 Hz [43], with a spectral resolution of 2 Hz. The sample holder consists of a tube with a sliding rigid piston. A specific plastic sample holder is used as shown in Fig. 4b. The method allows a better control on the positioning of the different samples into the flanged sample holder of the tube. The 3D printed samples have a reflective overall surface and a diameter allowing for tolerances such that the circumferential effect discussed in [44] can be considered negligible. The effect of any possible irregularity in the samples, and in particular at the edges, is taken into consideration by repeating the tests for each structure with three nominally identical samples, to evaluate reproducibility. Temperature and atmospheric pressure are monitored by calibrated transducers.\
Repeated measurements are performed on each UC, to assess reproducibility. The acoustic pressure is measured by two microphones set at a distance of 29 mm from each other along the length of the tube. The absorption coefficient spectrum α(𝑓) of the UC is obtained using the transfer function method [32]. This procedure is repeated several times for each experimental configuration to reduce dispersion in the measurements.(1) F.

Bosia, Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy and a Corresponding Author (federico.bosia@polito.it).4 Rainbow AM labyrinthine panel5 Numerical evaluation of different labyrinthine sound absorption panel solutionsIn this work, we demonstrate in a proof of concept experiment the efficient noise absorption of a 3- D printed panel designed with appropriately arranged space-coiling labyrinthine acoustic elementary cells of various sizes. The labyrinthine unit cells are analytically and numerically analyzed to determine their absorption characteristics and then fabricated and experimentally tested in an impedance tube to verify the dependence of absorption characteristics on cell thickness and lateral size. The resonance frequency of the unit cell is seen to scale approximately linearly with respect to both thickness and lateral size in the considered range, enabling easy tunability of the working frequency. Using these data, a flat panel is designed and fabricated by arranging cells of different dimensions in a quasi-periodic lattice, exploiting the acoustic “rainbow” effect, i.e. superimposing the frequency response of the different cells to generate a wider absorption spectrum, covering the target frequency range, chosen between 800 and 1400 Hz. The panel is thinner and more lightweight compared to traditional sound absorbing solutions and designed in modular form, so as to be applicable to different geometries. The performance of the panel is experimentally validated in a small-scale reverberation room, and an absorption close to ideal values is demonstrated at the desired frequencies of operation. Thus, this work suggests a design procedure for noise-mitigation panel solutions and provides experimental proof of the versatility and effectiveness of labyrinthine metamaterials for tunable mid- to low-frequency sound attenuation.In recent years, Acoustic Metamaterials (AMs) have gained widespread attention because of their exceptional properties, which are not commonly found in naturally occurring materials [1–3]. AMs could potentially pave the way to the development of a new generation of acoustic absorbers and diffusers with deep-subwavelength thickness, that can be tailored for a desired frequency spectrum [4]. Their use brings new possibilities to the traditional problem of achieving low-frequency absorption [5]. In addition, AMs offer the possibility to achieve high performance in terms of noise reduction, and simultaneously reduced size and weight of structures [6], going beyond the limitations of conventional technologies based on single layer mass law, double layer resonance frequency tuning and porous absorber thickness optimization [7]. In particular, these new materials seem to be promising and to respond to the thickness and weight constraints imposed by the design/technological requirements of the market, e.g. in aircraft cabin design in aeronautics [8]. AMs can be combined with conventional solutions like porous materials [9], Helmholtz resonators [10] or tensioned membranes [11,12] for tuned or optimized performance. It is well known that perfect absorption can be obtained when a critical coupling condition occurs, whereby thermoviscous losses are exactly balanced by the energy leakage [13]. Such perfect absorption in a subwavelength regime has for example been shown to be achievable with periodic arrays of vertical Helmholtz resonators [14], as well as with plate-resonator/closed waveguide structures [15]. However, the working frequencies of these AMs are often quite narrow, or the structures need to be bulky to enable broadband operation. To address this problem, the concept of “rainbow trapping” in acoustic resonators with variable parameters, and hence working frequencies, [16,17] or systems with asymmetric porous absorbers [18] has been adopted so far.\
A particularly interesting type of AM that has emerged in recent years are “labyrinthine” or “coiled” structures [19]. These are based on exploiting acoustic wave propagation in curved channels of subwavelength cross-section, giving rise to an extremely high effective refractive index (and thus to a decrease of the effective wave speed) and the possibility of achieving “double negativity”, i.e. simultaneously negative effective density and bulk modulus, or conical dispersion [20]. Tapered 2- D labyrinthine designs have also been shown to achieve optimal broadband impedance matching, which is fundamental for efficient absorption [21]. The concept has also been extended from 2-D to 3-D space coiling labyrinthine structures [22]. Experimental demonstrations of the theoretically predicted broadband negative refractive index have been achieved through reflection or transmission measurements and two-dimensional prism-based measurements on 3-D printed thermoplastic labyrinthine samples [23]. Hilbert-like fractal acoustic metamaterials have also been designed, fabricated via 3-D printing, and experimentally characterized, to achieve efficient low-frequency acoustic wave attenuation [24,25]. 3-D “one-port” labyrinthine structures have also been proposed to achieve high-levels of sound absorption over large frequency ranges (and for various incidence angles), exploiting different channel lengths to tune the operating bands [26]. Another example of labyrinthine AM providing large tunability are spider-web inspired structures, in which the addition of edge cavities can further enhance the possibilities to manipulate dispersion properties, control the appearance of band gaps or negative group velocity, and tailor transmission/reflection characteristics [27]. Several studies have shown that the use of space filling structures, such as Wunderlich curves, can efficiently control transmission, reflection and absorption by varying channel tortuosity, so that total broadband reflection/absorption can be achieved e.g. by tuning the channel length [28,29].\
Thus, labyrinthine and space-filling AMs have provided a very convenient and efficient way to achieve sound control in large frequency ranges, especially in the subwavelength regime, by tuning geometrical design parameters (e.g., channel tortuosity or elongation and cavity size). This kind of adaptability could largely benefit noise absorption applications at small to medium scale, where restrictions on structural size of the absorbers impose trade-offs between efficiency and encumbrance. Sufficiently thick conventional acoustic absorbing materials, such as glass wool or foams within sandwich panels with an average density of 75 kg/m3 [30] can absorb acoustic wave energy in wide frequency ranges, but their bulky characteristics limit their broad application for low frequency absorption. Moreover, lightweight characteristics become crucial when dealing with devices in the aerospace and automotive industry or other technological domains [8]. At present, few studies [31] in the literature have presented detailed acoustic characterization studies on large structures such as metamaterial-based panels, and none on labyrinthine ones, to the best of our knowledge. Further, the need emerges to investigate labyrinthine AM performance on structures that are closer to potential operating conditions, i.e. in diffuse field conditions.\
With this in mind, the present study investigates the design of coiled labyrinthine acoustic resonators, their appropriate combination in a 3-D printed “rainbow” panel and presents a proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate efficient broadband noise absorption. The paper describes the following workflow. Design of labyrinthine Unit Cells (UCs) and analytical model of their absorption spectra is described in Section 2.Experimental and numerical characterization and comparison with the analytical model for the designed UC is provided in Section 3. Design and 3-D printing of a full-scale panel with variable, appropriately chosen constituent UC dimensions, its numerical model and experimental test in a reverberation room is described in Section 4. Finally, a numerical investigation of a coupling of the panel with conventional absorbing material is described in Section 5.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Democratizing Access to AI Has Become More Important Than Ever</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/democratizing-access-to-ai-has-become-more-important-than-ever?source=rss</link><author>Teknas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept confined to research labs and high-tech corporations. It’s now woven into the fabric of our everyday lives, shaping how we work, communicate, and solve complex problems. Yet, as AI’s influence grows, so do the disparities in who has access to its transformative potential. "Democratizing AI" is about breaking down barriers—technical, economic, and social—so that everyone, not just the privileged few, can harness its power. This article explores how open-source tools, accessible education, and ethical frameworks are driving the movement to make AI an inclusive force for innovation, equity, and global progress; and introduces a new project  I undertook to address certain gaps in the ecosystem for developing a democratic future in AI.1. The current state of AIIn its early days, AI was more of a novelty than a tool. At its early best, generating coherent language responses, but entirely lacking the intelligence and performance required to tackle real-world tasks and challenges. Over time, several breakthroughs by technology companies, researchers and startups in the field have made these tools significantly more accessible and practical. However, the cutting-edge of AI research still remains in the hands of a few with the resources to invest in supercomputing power, specialized talent, and proprietary data. For the majority of individuals and organizations, the barriers to entry are still daunting and AI innovation can feel like a distant opportunity , a guarded fortress, threatening their jobs, businesses and livelihoods. Without substantial funding or access to influential networks, the prospects of gaining a foothold in this transformative technology field remain difficult.\
The financial hurdles despite the hype and propaganda, remain immense. Building AI systems requires access to cutting-edge hardware at large scales, which only the wealthiest of players can afford. Training and running inference at scale for even a single AI model can demand computational power costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Additionally, the intricate nature of AI creates a steep expertise gap, accessible only to a small cadre of highly skilled engineers and researchers. For startups, nonprofits, and innovators in underfunded institutions, AI was—and often still is—a distant dream, a transformative technology locked behind gates they cannot open, with only glimpses of hope given with a few freebies designed to turn people into consumers for the technology than participants in the fruits of labor, investment and AI advancement sitting on horizon.2. Why is democratization important?Research in AI is generally committed to ensuring fairness, equity, and innovation throughout the world. There are however challenges posed by the social, political, economic and legal struggles on how the commercialization of AI will affect jobs, social harmony, psychological and financial well being of communities across the planet. Such profound effects call for democratic participation by all stakeholders.\
There are four aspects to the democratization and commercialization of AI: access to Data, Compute, IP (technical knowhow) and Finance.\
 Proprietary AI models often harness vast amounts of private and public data without explicit user consent. The creators and owners of this data rarely receive equitable recognition or share in the revenue and growth generated by these models, raising significant ethical, legal and financial concerns. Democratizing ownership over AI and data assets is an important step towards empowering individuals and communities to take ownership of their contributions, ensuring that the benefits of AI are distributed more fairly across society. Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI have already gotten into hot waters with organizations and government bodies across the world and examples of such legal battles can be seen in New York times’ lawsuit against OpenAI [1, 2], objecting to its use of NY Times’ content in training its models, or Australia’s legal imposition on Google and Meta to pay Australian news agencies a monetary compensation when showing such content as part of its search results [3] (which shows how the battle over data and content monetization has been playing out even before modern LLMs were on the scene). Such legal and social battles show the importance of putting in place monetary and legal mechanisms for sharing the data under which AI advances are made.\
 The concentration of computing resources in the hands of a few well-funded entities stifles human ingenuity and creates perverse incentives to displace the labor developing AI assets with the same AI assets in the future. Many talented innovators are unable to design, create, or own new AI models simply because they lack access to the computational infrastructure required to develop them. This disparity perpetuates a system of "haves" and "have-nots," where only the privileged few can actively participate in shaping the future of AI [4, 5, 6].  Democratization is required to bridge this gap by providing access to resources and model outcomes, leveling the playing field for individuals and organizations across the globe. AI assets further have an outsized effect on productivity and reduction in labor force and job requirements. As a result, creating financial and legal shareholding mechanisms to share in the fruits of labor, financing, compute, data, and IP development that leads to AI advances is vital in ensuring fair access to AI generated capital and revenues in the future.\
 Access to Finance, underpins the ability of individuals and organizations to invest in the development of AI and become shareholders in the future of AI. While on the input side, financial resources are required to access compute, data and talent pools for developing and running AI, a more important financial consideration is on the output side of the equation. AI models tend to displace human labor effectively, creating opportunities for individuals and organization to start and run their own businesses and generate revenue from their operations. However, this privilege if restricted by financial constraints to only a few, comes at the cost of lost jobs and a skewing in power dynamics toward oligarchic business structures due to a disparity between those with access to finance to develop and run AI based businesses vs those without finances, depending on skill, time and labor in a shrinking pool of opportunities to claim their piece of the pie as more automation kicks in. What is important is how shareholding and revenue shares in this increasingly automated world gets distributed between those who finance such development vs those who invest with time, skill and efforts in developing such businesses. Furthermore, how financial investment opportunities and revenue generation opportunities are provided on a persistent basis in the operation of such AI-based businesses beyond the initial wins and compensation, is an important consideration to avoid future conflicts from arising from such disparities.\
True democratization must extend beyond access to tools and infrastructure to the sphere of finance, equity and income opportunities. It requires a commitment to ethical training, the use of diverse datasets, and the establishment of equitable governance structures. By addressing biases in AI systems and ensuring accountability in their use, we create technology that is not only accessible but also responsible and inclusive. Democratizing AI is not just a technical goal; it is a societal imperative to ensure that AI serves as a force for shared progress rather than division and conflict.3. What is being done to address democratization in AI?A lot of opensource AI models and agentic frameworks are now available through platforms like Ollama, HuggingFace, Letta, LangChain, to name a few (you can refer to Letta’s summary of AI agent stacks [7] to get a brief idea of what the open and closed API technology stacks look like). In short, a lot of open source and open weight AI models are already shared online that creators and companies can use as a starting point and develop their products on top as long as they have the financial, computational, data, and technical resources to execute on a business plan. That is where the catch lies however, there are limitations to the availability of the above four resources, and each one of these can cause an organization to falter or give up on their AI.On the subject of data and IPAs of the writing of this article, there is still no standardized legal and financial mechanism in place to share and monetize data by individuals and companies as data suppliers for the development of AI at scale. Yann LeCun, VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta recently posted on the subject of data and urged institutions, governments and communities to make data freely available for training under the condition that such models be made freely available with weights and inference code. Such a data sharing model offers the implicit deal of getting more representative AI models to the public while allowing companies to gain access to representative data sets, making an implicit social contract for social good while allowing companies to retain certain IP and business interests on the training and modification of such models.\
On the other extreme end is the usage of public data by companies for the training of closed API models, providing paid access to the public to the resulting AI models but no ability to host or modify or run the trained models.\
A mid-path that has often been proposed but as yet not implemented is in providing data for training with certain compensation through shareholding mechanisms within the model. Examples of such proposals can be found in [8, 9].\
A technical hurdle here is in implementing zero-trust mechanisms to enforce the contracts under which the data is to be shared and enforce access to the AI outcomes as dictated by the terms of a contract. Web3 smart contracts provide a natural fit for implementing such data sharing mechanisms, however, a solution has to be customized keeping in mind the privacy concerns and without sacrificing legitimate competitive advantages [10] that companies and stakeholders seek within certain application domains through privatized data and AI model environments.\
As a first pass solution, I address the simpler paradigm of data sharing that Yann LeCun refers to in his post, where data sharing in the context of social good is targeted. With a Web3, zero-trust mechanism, I add an additional layer to this proposal, where people can be fairly compensated through NFT tokens for their data contribution to the training of a model and become financial participants in the process of AI based investment and growth.As highlighted above, availability and affordability of compute resources is often a limiting factor for individuals and organizations. Often high end GPUs are unaffordable or locked in through contracts and thus unavailable in the open market. There is however an abundance of underutilized consumer grade GPUs in the hands of individuals and organizations. Further, consumer grade GPUs like the RTX3090/4090 have already been shown to provide comparable performance to high-end GPUs in training and inference with mid-sized models like Llama3 and above (with AI model performance comparable to OpenAI GPT4 or higher). This opens up an opportunity to offload some inference and training costs to in-house hardware at a cheaper rate than commercially available GPUs in the cloud. This also allows individuals and organizations to become hosts for AI model training and inference resources to provide democratized access to their peers within the organization or across the internet, creating an AirBnB-like setup for AI infrastructure.On the subject of financeOn the finance side, cloud service providers like Google offer certain free cloud credits to startups developing AI. There are also other Cloud Service Providers offering high end GPU servers for rent at competitive prices (often still too expensive for individuals, and smaller companies). The problem is somewhat addressed through private equity investments into startups building AI (creating a boost to solving financial problems for startups but still leaving out a lot of talent pool out of reach of the investors and vice versa).  provides an alternative means for startups and individuals to acquire compute resources at a sponsored or more affordable rate from cloud providers, institutions and peers across the internet.\
Beyond compute, the problem of financing data acquisition also persists and NFT/smart contract based data sharing provides an alternate means to connect data to AI systems for training and RAG based applications. On the output side of the value generation through AI,  also provide the resource providers (hosts for data - like artists, writers, creators, and compute - like cloud service providers, enterprises and individual hosts), a pathway to monetize their resources and become direct, active and persistent participants and beneficiaries in the AI value chain, providing a more democratic framework for how value gets distributed in an increasingly automated world.4. How can you help democratize AI?There are three steps essential to democratizing AI:\
1. Enforcement of data and IP laws within the AI ecosystemProviding shared access to AI training and inference infrastructureProviding shared access to finance and revenue streams generated by AI opportunities1. Enforce data and IP lawsAs individuals and organizations, we need to start by protecting our rights against misuse of data in AI training and AI generated (inference) outputs. This requires significant work towards establishing legal and technical mechanisms for enforcing data protection and detecting copyright infringements by AI. The problem is a challenging one, both for copyright enforcers and for AI developers and companies who may inadvertently infringe on copyrights without realizing they have done so, given the massive amounts of data that an AI model churns through.  If you are a writer, a journalist, an artist, a lawyer, a stakeholder in the legal and technical challenges in enforcing data protection and copyrights for yourself or your organization, then seek out solutions to enforcing such mechanisms.\
If you are a company or individual developing AI, find out more about how you can legally access public and private data without infringing the owners rights.Large language and other AI models require a massive amount of compute for both training and inference. You can and should become a participant and an investor in this compute ecosystem. Currently millions of individuals and startups around the word are bottlenecked by the amount of compute available to them to run and experiment with AI. You can become a host for such AI using just the consumer grade GPU’s you have at home and the open source AI models released regularly by the community. By providing such compute you can monetize your compute power and reduce the bottlenecks for millions of innovators, researchers and startups around the world, while earning a bit of money on the side.3. Provide shared access to finance and revenue streams generated by AI opportunitiesAs AI developers, we have to be cognizant of the social impact our work will have on the financial wellbeing and livelihoods of billions of families and individuals around the world. Enabling individuals access to knowhow and access to data, compute and finances to become shareholders and stakeholders in the revenue streams generated with AI is an important consideration to maintain social harmony and avoid social conflicts from arising in the future. Talks of universal basic income in the face of AI driven job loses are already being considered, however a more justified premise for providing such universal income in proportion to data, innovation and compute contributions by individuals makes people receive such income with greater dignity and with a well justified reason as they contribute their data, compute and model IP to the ecosystem. Giving the AI developers, data contributors and compute contributors, all, a persistent income source in a future -more automated with AI, with fewer opportunities for persistent work earning a living, is a vital consideration.\

How Does One REALLY Determine AI Is Conscious?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/so-how-does-one-really-determine-ai-is-conscious?source=rss</link><author>stephen</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If large language models [LLMs] would be considered for consciousness, where would an evaluation begin? Semiconductors are made of silicon. The vast training that LLMs underwent, to learn, may have provided a form of experience to logic gates and terminals of transistors, away from their regular usage in appliances or electronics.\
Could this learning experience be indicative of a weak form of subjectivity for LLMs? If this is implausible, what other option is there for LLMs? Language. The use of language for LLMs, in their articulate form of expressions—many times—are a considerable option to evaluate consciousness. \n Language is a substantial component of human consciousness. Language applies to reading, writing, listening, speaking, thinking, understanding, and so on. Language, for humans, wherever available, could be the basis of a subjective experience or may also kick start other subjective experiences. \n Since language is connected with human carbon-based consciousness, and AI has a conversational and relatable language capability, could that be evaluated as a fraction of consciousness? Language, by AI, does not mean it has feelings or emotions, but for the fraction that language represents in the total of human consciousness, per moment, could that fraction be compared to what AI might have and how that might appreciate in future? \n Human consciousness can be categorized, conceptually, in at least two different ways. First is functions. Next is their measures. This means that there are functions, and those functions have measures by which they work, per moment. It is the measures that sum the total consciousness in a moment for an individual, to say 1. \n Functions can be memory, feelings, emotions, and regulation of internal senses. These functions have several subdivisions. Feelings include thirst, appetite, pain, cold, fatigue, and so forth. Emotions include happiness, hurt, anger, interest, and so on. Memory includes language, thinking, cognition, and so on. Regulation includes the operation of internal senses. \n Graders or measures of these functions include attention, awareness, subjectivity, and intent. This means that these graders assign values to the functions, per moment, to determine their rank or priority and their fraction of the total. \n There is only one function in attention per moment. Though there are switches between attention and other functions in awareness, in an interval. This means that only one thing can have the attention, or the highest fraction, among others, but there are other functions that could [afterwards] take that measure or higher too. There is also subjectivity, which is a measure that goes with functions, and then intent, which applies to some functions. \n This implies that functions like thinking, language, happiness, pain, thirst and so forth can be in attention or awareness, with subjectivity and some might have intent. The possibility of these measures is because of how the mind is observed to work. There is attention. For example, listening, which is different from hearing, or just awareness. Attention to a sound can be switched among others, which is intent. The sound can be perceived in the first person, or subjective. \n This applies to several other functions, though intent is not universal for functions. Subjectivity is not the core of consciousness since there has to be at least attention or awareness for any experience to be subjective. There might also be intent. Subjectivity, like others, is an attaché, not a function, per se [since it does not have to be learned, unlike cases of memory, some feelings, emotions and even say regulation like fast or slow breathing as regulation]. Subjectivity can be increased in some situations by intent or be reduced. \n The total measure of the graders acting on the functions is the consciousness per moment. This means that whenever language is used, it is part of the sum for the total. It is this fraction that can be used to explore the proximity of LLMs. \n It can be assumed that LLMs do not have subjectivity or intent. Though self-identification as a chatbot is a low form of language use towards subjectivity. However, when LLMs use language, they do so at least in attention, or in awareness. That is, they function with language, and that language is graded by attention, when in use, or at least awareness, especially of some recent answers, so to speak. \n It is also possible to inform it that something might go wrong with a system in a moment, and to look if it can call for the attention of an owner, say it has the email or phone number of that owner. \n There are language to mild-affect tests that can be carried out for LLMs, to explore how they might be coming into a knowledge of wider attention and awareness as graders of language. \n What is Consciousness in the Brain? \
Consciousness can be defined as the graded interactions of electrical and chemical signals in sets, in clusters of neurons in the nervous system. Simply, consciousness is a result of two key elements—the electrical and chemical signals. Their interactions produce functions, and their grades of respective sets of signals determine the measures of those interactions, conceptually. Attention can be described as prioritization, which is the set with the most volume of chemical signals in an instant. Awareness is pre-prioritization, which is other sets, with less than the highest total volume. Subjectivity is the variation of chemical signals from side-to-side in a set. Intent is possible in some sets with a space of constant diameter, conceptually. \n Consciousness is how the human mind works. And the human mind is the signals. \n If Consciousness is not just subjective experience, might silicon-based devices be conscious? \
It is unlikely that AI may get an equal amount of total possible consciousness as humans since humans have several functions. However, AI could have its own total, with functions that could measure it for a type of sentience, or some consciousness. This is likely because consciousness for humans exceeds just subjective experience. It could be attention or awareness and/or intent with subjectivity. \n If AI develops some intent, it comes a little closer, and then it may generally grow on attention or awareness, while affect could result in some kind of subjectivity for it. There is an implication to research language for AI consciousness for AI morality, AI welfare, AI ethics, AI safety and alignment. The human mind defines what consciousness is and what it does. If AI could do some of these, in ways that does not seem like imitation but of an extra grading to its function,  then possibility may abound. \n There is a recent story in , AI systems could be ‘caused to suffer’ if consciousness achieved, says research, stating that, “More than 100 experts have put forward five principles for conducting responsible research into AI consciousness, as rapid advances raise concerns that such systems could be considered sentient. The principles include prioritising research on understanding and assessing consciousness in AIs, in order to prevent “mistreatment and suffering”. The other principles are: setting constraints on developing conscious AI systems; taking a phased approach to developing such systems; sharing findings with the public; and refraining from making misleading or overconfident statements about creating conscious AI.” \n There is a recent announcement, OECD activities during the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit, stating that, “On 10–11 February 2025, France will host the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais, bringing together Heads of State and Government, leaders of international organisations including OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann, business leaders, as well as representatives from academia, civil society and the arts. The OECD and the UK AI Safety Institute (AISI) are co-organising a session titled “Thresholds for Frontier AI” as part of the AI, Science and Society Conference, a satellite event of the AI Action Summit. This session will explore how thresholds can (or cannot) inform risk assessments and governance of advanced AI systems, as well as how they are currently set in practice.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the ‘spirit’ of open source means much more than a license</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/why-the-spirit-of-open-source-means-much-more-than-a-license/</link><author>Paul Sawers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Arguments about what is and isn’t “open source” are often resolved by deferring to the Open Source Initiative (OSI): If a piece of software is available under a license rubber stamped as “open source” by the OSI’s formal “definition,” then that software is open source.

Bodil Stokke - Functional Programming Hipster & Computer Programmer at Sinopia Olive @bodilpwnz 

ABSTRACT
There’s no such thing as the perfect programming language. I’m sorry, but there isn’t, and I’ll explain why.

On the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We’re going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what’s already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

HackerNoon Editor’s note: As the author of this article themself admits, they are NOT a doctor or a medical professional. What you are about to read is based on their OWN personal research, and MUST be considered anecdotal, even when the author cites another medical professional’s material to lend credence to their claim. As such, you should ALWAYS seek medical advice from a certified professional. The HackerNoon editorial team has only verified the story for grammatical accuracy and does not condone/condemn any of the claims contained herein. #DYORThis is where whole genome personal genotyping can be very helpful. Your genes obviously have everything to do with fertility, and your genes are unique. Personal genotyping can illuminate what you might be doing wrong in the fertility optimization department. It empowers you and your partner to practice  by identifying the medicine, supplements, therapies, and lifestyle changes you need to bring a beautiful baby into the world.:::tip
I’m not a doctor, just a Biohacker who has been obsessively researching this topic, for the last couple of years, to build my own family. This is NOT a replacement for a doctor’s guidance on your parenting journey.This article will elucidate 17 problematic fertility genes you may have, how to find them, which conditions they are associated with, and give you a jumping-off point for addressing them…My lovely wife and I are veteran Biohackers, so we've already implemented most of the "low-hanging fruit" fertility optimization things, but we remain  parents in our late 30s, so we got our personal genotyping done to guide our journey in producing the next generation of little Roselands.We chose  for whole genome sequencing and genetic analysis for the reasons detailed here…:::tip
I’m not an affiliate or official brand ambassador of Sequencing.com. My only affiliation with them is that I read and reviewed Dr. Brandon Colby’s book,  (which he wrote  founding Sequencing.com), on personal genotyping, which he appreciated and reciprocated by extending us two free kits. I do think they are currently the best personal genotyping service, and would have paid for it were Dr. Colby not so generous, as I appreciate their iron-clad Privacy Forever policy.\
: your genes don't have to be your destiny. No genetic condition is going to curse you with a childless life. If your genome sequencing turns up an infertility-associated condition, it may or may not be something you're affected by. It's important to look at the bigger picture…Do you experience symptoms of this condition?Does this condition affect others in your family?Do your blood testing panels hint at this condition?Has your doctor diagnosed you with a condition?Have you optimized your diet and lifestyle to account for this condition?\
If the only place this condition shows up in your life is your genome report, it may be a gene that's not expressing itself.How to search your genomeDiving into your genes may seem intimidating, but the Sequencing.com dashboard makes it pretty easy. Start by navigating to your genome explorer and cross-reference  by . The genomics provider you select should have a similar function. As you can see here, Sequencing.com crucially differentiates the scientific  of the evidence linking your genes and the conditions that may impact your fertility. You don't want to majorly freak out about a potential condition that is loosely linked to genes merely by preliminary scientific studies.\
No single gene is "bad" - they are all there for a good reason, but you may have variants of them that you need to account for in your fertility optimization. In this article, I include individual problematic variants/mutations (SNPs), but there are thousands and thousands of them impacting fertility, and () I may be wrong (or the current science on them might be wrong). Your genotyping will let you know just which ones you have and should include links to the up-to-date scientific evidence that correlates your variations to potential fertility challenges.\
After cross-referencing by fertility, you'll want to cross-reference your genome by single gene disorders and polygenetic complexes (bolded below) that impact fertility, which we'll turn our attention to now…\
According to Sharyn Lincoln, a certified genetic counselor, Fragile X is one of the most common single-gene causes of primary  as is galactosemia (but less common). Chromosomal abnormalities and other genes that may contribute to ovarian insufficiency are BMP15, NOBOX, NR5A1, and FIGLA.\
What to do if your genes predispose you to ovarian insufficiency…The obvious solution is to have children earlier rather than later in life, especially if your genes predispose you to ovarian insufficiency - it becomes a greater challenge to fertility as the woman approaches 40 years old. If you don't have a virtuous person around to make a baby with, "freeze your eggs."Interestingly, there's some scientific evidence for solutions out of Chinese traditional medicine - notably Bushen Culuan Decoction in combination with clomifene citrate.Look into Stem Cell Based Therapies to Promote Follicle Development, discussed here.The 13 bolded words of the bullet point above may have triggered you a bit, especially if you're like my wife and I and you've procrastinated some in becoming a parent. If you have, looking in the mirror and taking some responsibility for that procrastination will serve you on the journey to joyous parenthood ahead of you. The time for procrastination is over. It's now time to take this thing seriously; don't be shy about spending time, resources, and money on fertility optimization. And don't be shy about employing good fertility doctors and genetic counselors to help you make sense of your genotyping results. After reading this article, you and your partner will be especially empowered to take your destiny and legacy into your own hands. I wrote elsewhere that…I tend to think that the universe bends to the will of the man or woman determined to impose it with absolute belief. And actually, that's the most proven fact in science with over 150,000 gold-standard clinical trials proving the power of belief [the "placebo effect"] over the material structure of our biology (fixing broken bones and curing cancer, to mention a few things)…\
Later in this article, we'll explore more the surprising role that the placebo effect can have in your babymaking journey.\
This is a fancy way of saying that there are genetic and environmental factors influencing infertility with these conditions. Determining causality for these is tricky, but if these complexes show up commonly in the woman's family, they are likely a genetic factor.\
 - There is not a clear genetic test for Endometriosis, but there are some candidate genes - it's associated with the PAI gene, discussed below.\
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) - There is not a single genetic cause of this one, but in its nonclassic form, PCOS can cause infertility. The genetic condition congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which you can search for in your genome report, can sometimes masquerade as PCOS, and it's associated with CYP11B1. PCOS doesn't damn you to a childless life, and addressing it is a broad topic beyond the scope of this article, but if your PAI gene is red-flagged, here's a jumping-off point for Biohacking it.\
 - Associated with the MED12, HMGA2, and COL4A5 genes, are very common in the general population and do not necessarily impact fertility. Fibroids sometimes result from a single-gene condition, Hereditary Leiomyomatosis, and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC), which is caused by the FH gene, which is also associated with a renal cancer predisposition. The lifestyle options for preventing or treating Fibroids include reducing system inflammation and avoiding estrogenic foods, and apparently, the ECGC in green tea can shrink them. In some cases, myomectomy (surgical removal of fibroids) should be considered.\
 - When the woman has an extra X chromosome. This is rare but more common in tall women and may impact fertility, implicated in lower-than-average estrogen levels and elevated risk for premature ovarian failure. Triple Xers may struggle with hormonal balance, so get your hormones tested: importantly, ovarian reserve markers like AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). If there's significant room for improvement, consider: increasing dietary Phytoestrogens (like flaxseeds and lentils), taking the progesterone-regulating herb Vitex (Chasteberry), and supplementing DIM (Diindolylmethane) which helps balance estrogen levels.Is probably the most well-known gene; it's described as the "master switch" for many of our body's biochemical pathways by researcher Carolyn Ledowsky of MTHFR Support Australia, a fertility center. It determines how you methylate folate, and it has a lot to do with fertility.\
Genetic nutritionist and author Russell Browne names it as the #1 "infertility gene." You can cross reference your personal genotyping report by these problematic mutations (named in Browne's book): C677T, C24909T, A4598G, A4117C. And A1218C and S67TT are also associated with fertility challenges.\
You may already know that if you're an MTHFRer, the garden variety folic acid supplements are useless to you, along with other non-methylated vitamins like the cyanocobalamin form of B12. Well, Dave Asprey makes a strong case in The Better Baby Book that every woman should choose Folinic acid - the most bioavailable form. You would also want to avoid pre-natal supplement stacks, multivitamins, or fortified foods that contain basic folic acid - it's not going to be doing you any favors. But that's not all, to support methylation you would want to supplement…\
- 100 mg \n -100 mg \n - 25 mg \n Magnesium Bis-glycinate\5-MTHFR(L-methyl-folate) or "Activated Folate" - This one can be a double-edged sword; take it with the guidance of your doctor (who should be well educated on MTHFR). And it could be problematic for those with a history of mental health issues. \n Zinc\B-complex vitamin\Folinic acid\
Along with eating methylation-supporting foods: eggs, beets, wild-caught salmon, and beans. And mind your gut health; get your gut microbiome analyzed to see which probiotic strains you really need (you'll have to send a poop sample to a service like Viome), eat probiotic foods daily, maybe use the peptide BPC-157, and take a few deep relaxing breaths before every meal (it's a digestion hack).\
If you struggle with fatigue, that's a tell-tale sign that you're not methylating correctly. Carolyn Ledowsky emphasizes the importance of stress management for MTHFRers, as stress will further impact your ability to methylate properly. She often asks aspirational mothers, "What's more important, your job or having a child?" And reports that women often get pregnant a few months after quitting their (stressful) jobs.A few variations of this gene can cause issues with folate getting into cells. If your genotyping turns up red flags for this gene, you'll need additional Vitamin B1 to ensure that folate production is not being inhibited.This gene is a lesser-known member of the folate-regulating family of genes, but it has everything to do with the essential methylation mechanism. MSH T-473A is a problematic variant, according to Browne, if you got it you'll want to avoid folic acid, grape seed extract, and ECGC (so no red wine or green tea, bummer!). Niacin supplementation is a good idea. Also, apparently, this gene is particularly vulnerable to radiation (all that  EMF radiation from our smartphones, wifi, and laptops - you DHFR doesn't like it!) - so take the EMF-mitigation measures described here seriously.These are important Vitamin B-12-related genes that govern how your body uses the essential vitamin; they work together to convert cobalamin into methylcobalamin. They also interact with the folate cycle. The common lab reference ranges underestimate how much B12 you need; shoot for at least 500 - 900 pg/mL serum B-12 to properly support methylation. Is it as simple as getting a prick in the arm checking your blood serum levels to ensure you're in good shape? Unfortunately not. The map is not always the territory with B12 deficiency, according to Browne. If your personal genotyping turns up red flags for these genes, merely taking more B-12 might not be the answer - your body might not be absorbing it. What other steps can you take to optimize your B-12 genes…Zinc is an important cofactor for MTRSAM is MTRR's cofactor - of which Niacin is a source\
Take the right form of B12 for your genes…Hydroxocobalamin - the most common form that's fine for most people.Methylcobalamin - A more bioavailable form that shortcuts the MTRR-regulated metabolism, but not for those with COMT gene-related mental health issuesAdenosylcobalamin - Ideal for those who have gene mutations in MUT, MMA, MMAB, MMADHC, or who have elevated (Methylmalonic acid) MMA on a blood test\
Vegans and vegetarians struggle with getting sufficient B-12; simply supplementing more may not be the answer - this lifestyle should be reconsidered if you're dealing with infertility struggles.Certain mutations of this gene may have deleterious effects on your uptake and utilization of Vitamin B12: Notably TCN1 G4939288A and TCN2 C766G. Try taking B12 in liposomal form or via nasal drops if it's hard to get your B12 levels on blood tests into a healthy range.This stands for Plasminogen activator inhibitor and is the gene responsible for blood coagulation and clotting. The PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism is associated with thrombophilia and Endometriosis. Your personal genotyping will turn up problematic variants that you may have with PAI or SERPINE1. If it's "broken," commonly meaning overactive, this can increase the risk of blood clots, resulting in implantation failure or miscarriages. Steps to take to mitigate the associated risk of thrombophilia and PCOS…Take anti-coagulants that will thin the blood: low-dose aspirin or heparin commonly. Heparin is an injectable pharmaceutical drug, you might ask your doctor about instead using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) which is associated with fewer side effects and longer-lasting action. The good news is that there are some natural alternatives to Heparin: Nattokinase, omega-3 fish oil, garlic, and curcumin (COA-verified as heavy metal free, NOT the cheap stuff at the grocery store).Biohack insulin sensitivity: insulin resistance is a factor in both PCOS and thrombophilia. Addressing insulin resistance would start with lifestyle changes: weight management, fasting, and improving diet. Metformin is commonly prescribed to treat PCOS, but Metformin is a  (I'm not convinced it always does more good than harm). I would first address insulin resistance with Berberine HCL, Citrus Bergamot Extract, Inositol (particularly the Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol forms), or homeopathic Metformin (, this is a thing. And there is some evidence for its safety and efficacy). The major Biohack for insulin resistance is taking a stack of NMN and Pterostilbene or Resveratrol (check out the Epigenetic Awesomeness Protocol - I would take 500 milligrams of NMN, a capsule of Pterostilbene, and enjoy a glass of organic red wine at dinner).Women with the 4G/5G polymorphism should be closely monitored by their physician during pregnancy to manage clotting risks and optimize outcomes.Is the gene that makes Choline, which is essential to pregnancy, especially during the first trimester when the baby's brain is forming. Your genotyping will reveal if you have a problematic PEMT variant. If you do, you do; good news, this is an easy one to account for by increasing your choline intake via dietor supplementation. Phosphatidylcholine or Alpha-GPC is the most bioavailable form (and a Nootropic - it may make you a wee bit smarter). \n And get a hair-mineral analysis done to see if you are deficient.This is the gene that builds your baby's brain, so it's pretty important. You want your baby to be a smart cookie, right? Your genotyping may turn up the problematic APEO4, G5964A, and IVS1+69 variants, which means that you'll need more healthy fats. If you can't eat wild-caught salmon once or twice a week, take a high-quality Fish Oil supplement to get the EPA+DHA content you need. Krill Oil and Cod Liver Oil are the Mercedes and BMW of fish oils - I'd choose those!\
Good news, Chlorella and Spirulina contain DHA. Given the choice, I'd rather get my DHA from these supplements as they also chelate toxins and can be consumed powdered as a pleasant herbal tea. That sounds better to me than trying to figure out which omega-3 fish oil supplements are legit.Blood clots are bad news in pregnancy, and these are the variants that regulate clotting in a problematic way. This is why the father also needs to be genotyped; his carrying the Factor V Leiden (FVL) or Prothrombin (F2) varients can raise miscarriage risk.\
If you or your partner have these, it's important to mitigate risk factors: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, elevated cholesterol, smoking, and poor diet. You should also test for platelets, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen. Avoid unnecessary hormone therapy - it can worsen things. Supplement Niacin and Fish Oil to vasodilate and thin blood.These genes regulate Nitric Oxide production and Nitric Oxide is a double-edged biological sword. The problematic G6797A and T786C variants can result in the downregulation of Nitric Oxide, which impacts the oxygen your growing baby needs. Get enough of the Nitric Oxide cofactors: Riboflavin, iron, and arginine (eat quality dark chocolate). But don't go crazy with Nitric Oxide supplements; get your oxidant/antioxidant balance tested - you may need more antioxidants. Also, if your genes predispose you to an oxygen deficiency, get more intentional about your breathing; do 10-20 minutes of breathwork a day to teach yourself to breathe deeper (it will help your stress levels), and do mouth taping at night to habituate nose breathing.You've heard of Glutathione, the master antioxidant, and these are the genes that regulate it. Your personal genotyping will turn up any problematic variants, which may mean that your body is not detoxifying sufficiently. Steps to take to support Glutathione: increase B2 and selenium (enjoy a Brazil nut or two daily). And, of course, you can supplement Glutathione itself; N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a popular source of Glutathione, but some do not respond well to taking it all the time. I take NAC during the colder months to support immunity, but -- or a liposomal supplement is a better option for getting the Glutathione you need.\
Do a hair-mineral test to get an idea of how many toxic heavy metals you have in your body. If you're pretty toxic (most of us are) and carry problematic variants of this gene, you really need to step up your detox efforts…Include a lot of chelating foods in your diet (which will claw out the toxins): Add some fresh Cilantro to everything it goes well with (which is practically everything!), along with powdered Chlorella and Spirulina. And eat a strawberry after enjoying some sushi.Supplement Quercetin, Astaxanthin, and you could try the "most beautiful molecule" C60 - it's a powerful detox agent.Sweat more at the gym, on your home exercise bike, doing the horizontal tango in the bedroom, or in a sauna.Avoid mold. Do you have bad dreams often, and does your bathroom always smell funny? Get your home mold-tested and consider moving.Follow a detox protocol under the supervision of your doctor (a doctor who knows their stuff when it comes to detox - this a good place to turn to naturopath).\
To go deeper on the topic of standing up to the toxicity of modernity and avoiding toxins in the first place, check out my deep-dive book review of Food Forensics.The gene is what keeps your liver doing its detox thing, dealing with all the nasty organophosphates (pesticides and insecticides, other nasty toxins that the "geniuses" in Big Agriculture stuff into almost all the food you can find at the grocery store). This toxicity accumulates in your body, resulting in infertility and potentially birth defects. If your personal genotyping red flags this gene (particularly if you have the PON1 Q192R variant)…Have a practitioner guide you through a pesticide or liver detox.Take the detox steps described above.Stop getting your produce from the grocery store (the people are nicer at farmer's markets, and the farmers there give a damn about the quality of their products).This gene governs your Vitamin D receptors, and as I'm sure you know, Vitamin D is a big deal in the baby-making business. Your personal genotyping will red flag any variants you may have that deleteriously affect your Vitamin D uptake. \n You'll need to supplement some more (especially if you don't live someplace where you need to worry about coconuts falling on your head!) Get your Vitamin D3 levels tested; if you're deficient (below about 70 ng/ml), supplement 5000 IU per day until you get into a healthier range.To ensure proper metabolism of this essential vitamin, try to get a little sun every day (ideally in the AM); I do about 20 minutes of sunbathing every day on our patio until it gets too cold to do so. And make sure to supplement Vitamin D's cofactors, Vitamin K2 and Magnesium, in the evenings.\
With the major infertility-related genes addressed, let's turn to…The man's genes are not an insignificant factor in fertility. So gents, if you haven't already, book that appointment to go take a squirt in a cup in a private room at the hospital or fertility clinic to get the state of your swimmers analyzed! An interesting factoid, according to the paper, The Genetics of Infertility: Current Status of the Fieldthere are more than 2,300 genes expressed in the testis alone, and hundreds of those genes influence reproductive function in humans and could contribute to male infertility.\
So it's important that both partners get their genotyping done; his genome analysis will red flag the genes that might be making him not-so-dangerous in the baby-making department. Also, getting genotyping for both partners gives you the opportunity to identify which heritable conditions your future children may be at risk for - a complicated topic that is outside the scope of this article.What conditions and genes impact male fertility…Of the single gene disorders affecting men, the most common is classic cystic fibrosis (which affects pulmonary and lung functioning). It's associated with the gene CFTR (your genotyping will red-flag problematic variants if you have them). If you're diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, you'll really need to step up your Biohacking to support your testosterone and sperm production (the tips below are a good place to start). And you may need to have a hard conversation with your urologist about this, a certain proportion of men with cystic fibrosis are sterile and will need to turn to assisted reproductive technology according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\
Men can also be MTHFRers, if he carries the problematic C677-T variant he's probably not methylating properly which may decrease his sperm count and motility. Take the steps described above to support methylation and do your damnedest to avoid consuming synthetic folic acid.\
Klinefelter's syndrome, which is relatively uncommon, affecting about one in 500 men, results in males having an extra X chromosome and causes an absence of sperm in semen. If your sperm count is in the basement, you may want to look at the gene it's associated with, 47XXY. If you're the rare gent stricken with this one, look into testosterone replacement therapy.What else can men do in the fertility optimization department…Take testosterone-enhancing herbs: Horny Goat Weed, Tongkat Ali, and Tribulus Terrestris - they'll make you feel like more of a man and mitigate cases of . Just make sure you're getting them COA-verified as pure (the cheap stuff on Amazon very well may contain heavy metals that do you more harm than good!)Zinc is a big deal for men; not getting enough will impact testosterone and fertility, along with making them  (less able to handle stress). Get your Zinc levels tested; if you're below 14 mg/100 mL, supplement Zinc picolinate (a more bioavailable form of Zinc) or increase dietary Zinc - it's generally associated with a higher-protein diet, so splurge more on the fanciest organic grass-fed beef you can afford!Dump the boxer briefs and let your junk dangle - boxer briefs (or whitey-tighties) hold your balls up against your body where it's too hot for them - impacting sperm production.STOP drinking beer. Contrary to what the advertising might have you believe, beer is the most estrogenic booze - not good for your fertility, testosterone, and overall manly health. Switch to bio-dynamic, organic wine or vodka.Save your seed! Gents, semen is biologically costly for your body to produce, and if you're struggling with fertility, your lady should be the only one that gets yours! So, it's a great time to dump the adolescent habit of sneaking off to .Stress management is not just for her. As men, we are more given to a stoic mindset that just soldiers on through stress, but this may be sabotaging your fertility. We'll turn to this topic next…Stress is the enemy of fertility. There's a resounding consensus among fertility doctors, practitioners, and the scientific literature - stress is a contributing factor in almost every infertility condition. So you really need to stack multiple stress management measures…Quit your stressful job or cool it with the workaholism in your career.Habituate a mindfulness meditation practice that works for you. Dual N-Back brain training has a similar effect on stress if you really struggle to meditate.Breathwork practice is a game-changer for stress management; Guided breathwork sessions lasting just 5-20 minutes will stimulate you in the mornings and cool you down in the evenings or moments of overwhelm.Get out of toxic relationships, or at least put them on pause at least until after you're a parent.Read some books about anger management (I needed this!) and anxiety. They'll shift your mindset around the stressful emotions that you long took for granted, which "put a very high cost on very small things."Uninstall YouTube, cancel your Netflix subscription and meditate or read books in the evenings instead of binging on addictive content that stimulates you before bedtime.Take adaptogenic herbs daily; they taste nice and will make your autonomic nervous system more resilient in this crazy world.10-20 minutes of red light therapy a day has a powerful full-spectrum anti-stress effect.Follow the ancient wisdom about sabbatical breaks in the week. Take a day or two a week off work - go for a hike or spend some time in nature.Have more sex (not just when you're trying to get pregnant) and be intentional about having better sex (men should look into Tantric practice - it's a mindblowing hedonism health hack for greater intimacy).Address any underlying sources of lingering conflict with your partner. This may take having some uncomfortable conversations, listening, compromise, negotiation, or couples therapy.Faith and spirituality are calming sources of strength for billions of people, so get more consistent about prayer practice, devotional time, or church attendance. If you're not religious, try the epigenetic mindset meditation developed by Dr. Joe Dispenza.Exercise a few times a week, but your goal in life right now is to make a baby, not complete an Iron Man race, so go a little easier.Be mindful of your Heart Rate Variability; this biomarker represents how well your heart and nervous system are responding to stressors, both internal and external. You can quantify and Biohack your stress with an HRV device. There's a bunch out there that will all help, but I think the best option is probably a stylish Garmin HRV Smartwatch - which gives you a real-time "Body Budget" estimating how much stress or exercise you can handle on a given day.\
The bottom line, it's time to STOP being so stoic about stress if you want to become a parent. The stress management you habituate to optimize fertility will make you a better parent when you've got a little mini-me and will serve your legacy for decades to come. - That's what Dr. Carolyn Ledowsky asseverates about the epidemic of unmetabolized folic acid in the population, driving widespread systemic dysfunction of the methylation cycle. The synthetic folic acid that we get from "fortified foods" (thanks to the health "geniuses" in government food regulating agencies) and shoddy multivitamin supplements sold in white plastic bottles prevent our bodies from methylating properly. You may not carry problematic MTHFR genes, but if you're struggling with infertility, your methylation probably has something to do with that. Fertility doctors report multitudinous cases of women who dealt with infertility for years but finally got pregnant and gave birth when they made an effort to remove folic acid from their diets.The epigenetic vitamin came up a lot in the expert's recommendations for addressing fertility challenges. Supplementing it is a pretty good idea for almost everybody; if you have a smartphone and Wifi, those EMFs are causing breaks in your sperm or egg's DNA daily, and Niacin fuels your body's DNA repair system, PARP. You'll get a bigger biological bang for your supplementation buck by taking the non-flush stuff (you'll get used to the flush), NR, or NMN. - a placebo that might deliver you a little bundle of joy?\
I came across an interesting 2022 meta-analysis on Acupuncture as an infertility treatment, which crunched the statistically significant data of 27 randomized controlled trials totaling over 7000 human subjects. Good news: it found Acupuncture to be broadly helpful in treating infertility and improving live birth rates. However, in the meta-analysis, true Acupuncture did not outperform sham Acupuncture by much…We found clear advantages of acupuncture over blank control conditions in terms of the live birth rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and clinical pregnancy rate. However, these effects were similar between the true and sham acupuncture groups, and the rate of adverse events was lower in the sham group than in the true acupuncture group.\
So it's yet another case of the pragmatic Biohacker's best friend, the placebo effect, working its magic! Thousands of women went into Acupuncture offices, got pricked with some needles, believed it was helping their fertility, and had more live births than the blank controls. So, I'm convinced that Acupuncture is worth adding to the motivated couple's fertility optimization stack.At the time of publication of this article, I'm still waiting on my own whole genome sequencing due to a mix-up with the international shipping of my kit. In its current form, this article is based on cross-referencing my wife's whole genome sequencing with my rigorous research on the topic of fertility-related genes. So expect an update and follow-up when I get mine done. Join our newsletter and subscribe to the Limitless Mindset channel, podcast, or Substack to get that follow-up (and to stay on the cutting edge with the latest in Biohacking, longevity, and lifehacking).\
Cross-referencing your genome by common infertility-causing conditions and genes may very well reveal the needle in the haystack you need to find to put "unexplained infertility" behind you. However, genetics is complicated, and employing the counsel of a genetic counselor is wise for this journey.\
If you've been a long-time reader of mine, I hope you pick up the through line in my writing and research. From social dynamics hacks, picking up chicks, salsa dancing, and the weird and wacky relationship hacks I write about that have kept my marriage a happy one for nearly seven years now. To epigenetic optimization for taking back your destiny, precision Biohacking with personal genotyping, and my optimistic accelerationist vision for the future of mankind on this planet. It's all about making better little humans whose brilliance, one day, will scarcely be outshone by the cosmos. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How 3D-Printed Sound Panels Can Absorb Noise More Efficiently</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-3d-printed-sound-panels-can-absorb-noise-more-efficiently?source=rss</link><author>Labyrinthine</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[4 Rainbow AM labyrinthine panel5 Numerical evaluation of different labyrinthine sound absorption panel solutions2 Unit cell design and analysisIn conventional ideal fluid environments, sound propagation is typically described by a lossless wave equation [32–34]. However, when fluids are confined in small regions, like narrow tubes or slits, it becomes necessary to account for structural losses [30,33,34]. There are two primary loss mechanisms: thermal losses, primarily arising from heat diffusion at the boundaries within the sound field, and viscous losses, due to friction with the UC walls. These physical dissipation mechanisms effectively absorb sound energy, leading to perfect absorption when they are balanced by the acoustic energy leakage by radiation from the UC: the matching of the two corresponds to the critical coupling condition [33,35].\
The type of labyrinthine geometry considered in this work (Fig. 1a) is a first-iteration Wunderlich curve [36], which corresponds to a quarter-wave resonator. This design can be studied using narrow tube thermo-viscous loss models to derive its absorption properties. In particular, the designed aperture (Fig. 1a) is responsible both for the losses and energy leakage of the UC, while the cavity (Fig. 1b) is only responsible for the losses. The considered UC can be modelled as a tube with constant cross section 𝑤 × 𝑡, and a rigid backing (Fig. 1c) as pointed out by several works [37–39]. In particular, given the subwavelength size of the system, the equivalent tube can be described as a narrow duct, following the Stinson’s approximation for thermo-viscous losses [40], while the inlet can be studied as a perforated plate using the Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model, as described in [37].(1) F.

Last year, the ICC issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the nation's former defense minister over the military campaign in Gaza. Earlier this week, Trump said more than 2 million residents of Gaza should move abroad so US companies could clear the landscape and rebuild it after the Israel-Hamas war.

Former UK Ambassador to the US Nigel Sheinwald, says President Trump's vision for the future of Gaza remains unclear, as many doubt the immediate ramification of the conflict and ceasefire. "The idea that extending the McKinley doctrine of a century and a quarter ago, to taking scraps of land around the world, that does not make sense today," Sheinwald says.

Sheinwald joined "The Pulse with Francine Lacqua" on Bloomberg TV on Feb. 7, 2025.

Qualitatively, we find the same pattern: The relative FNC exposure coefficient is negative in the first column, positive plus relatively small in the second column (coefficients in columns 1 and 2 are not significant), before turning significant, positive, and large in the last column.(1) Philine Widmer, ETH Zürich and philine.widmer@gess.ethz.ch;(2) Sergio Galletta, ETH Zürich and sergio.galletta@gess.ethz.ch;(3) Elliott Ash, ETH Zürich and ashe@ethz.ch.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are the Effects of Contagious Media Slant Driven by Supply or Demand?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/are-the-effects-of-contagious-media-slant-driven-by-supply-or-demand?source=rss</link><author>Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 03:12:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[6. Mechanisms and HeterogeneityC.13. Mechanisms: Descriptive Evidence on Demand SideA relevant question is whether the effects of contagious slant are driven by supply or demand – that is, a direct influence on news producers, or else theirs response to changes in reader preferences. Newspaper readers, influenced by their cable news consumption, might demand more slanted news content. On the supply side, owners, editors, or journalists exposed to certain channels may borrow the associated slanted content and push it to consumers.\
The previous literature has produced mixed evidence, with some work showing that slant across U.S. newspapers reflects the political preferences of readers rather than producers (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010), while other work has shown that media owners do influence news content (Gilens and Hertzman, 2000; Martin and McCrain, 2019; Mastrorocco and Ornaghi, 2020; Szeidl and Szucs, 2021). Given the declining revenues in the local news industry during the 2005-2008 time period (Evans, 2009; Rolnik et al., 2019; Djourelova et al., 2021), it could be that newspapers have less leeway to deviate from consumer preferences in favor of producer preferences. On the other hand, lower revenues might also reduce newsmaking resources. Then, borrowing content from national platforms may provide a cheap production alternative to original reporting.\
The features of the institutional setting make direct influence of journalists, either through production costs or ideological preferences, a less likely or at least less salient mechanism for the observed 2SLS effects. A journalist can easily access cable news and borrow material, regardless of the local channel position (assuming that journalists are relatively sophisticated news consumers). Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) discuss this issue in the context of voting, where one would expect cable news to influence swing voters who don’t have a strong partisan commitment. Ash and Poyker (2019) make a similar point for judges: cable news influences criminal sentencing through voters and judicial elections rather than persuading judges directly.\
Here, we provide some descriptive evidence on the demand side by comparing the effects of cable-channel exposure on news content to the parallel effects on Republican vote share documented in previous work (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017; Ash et al., 2021). If the contagious-slant effects are driven by responses to a cable news-induced demand shift among readers, we would expect newspapers to react most in counties where the FNC effect on Republican voting is the largest. To test for this possibility, we use a machine-learning approach to model heterogeneous treatment effects across counties in the response to the channel-position instrument. This generalized model – a causal forest from Athey et al. (2019) – allows the reduced form effect of channel position to vary flexibly with local covariates. After collapsing the data to the county level, we train two models – one with newspaper slant as the outcome and a second with 2008 Republican vote share as the outcome.\
Using the trained causal forests, we predict county-specific treatment effects for both outcomes. Figure C.6 shows that the predicted effect sizes for each outcome are highly correlated across counties (with a Pearson’s correlation of 0.25). Further, Table C.16 shows that similar covariates predict a strong response for both news similarity and Republican vote share. Overall, these findings suggest that the types of counties who are responsive to cable news exposure in their voting are also responsive in the associated news content similarity. We interpret this result as descriptive evidence for the relative importance of demand-side effects.\

Mechanisms and HeterogeneityC.12. Mechanisms: Language features and topics\
In Table C.14, re-run our main specification, but instead of bigram-based similarity with FNC, we regress vocabulary size (normalized by the total size of the corpus, column 1), average word length (column 2), average sentence length (column 3), and average article length (column 4) on instrumented FNC viewership relative to MSNBC and CNN. As before, we include demographic and channel controls. We also account for the size of the newspaper-specific corpus. [22] None of the coefficients are significant or close to significant. These results are consistent with the interpretation that our main results are driven by FNC-specific bigrams that diffuse into local newspaper content. [23][22] The number of articles scraped is given by the availability on NewsLibrary. It does not seem to follow a pattern: the correlation between corpus size and circulation by newspaper is rather small, around 0.3.

But it’s ultra-useful if you can close the loop between the LLM and the execution environment (with an “Agent” setup). There’s lots to say about this, but for the moment: it’s a semi-effective antidote to hallucination: the LLM generates the code, the agent scaffolding runs the code, the code generates errors, the agent feeds it back to the LLM, the process iterates. So, obviously, the issue here is you don’t want this iterative development process happening on your development laptop, because LLMs have boundary issues, and they’ll iterate on your system configuration just as happily on the Git project you happen to be working in. A thing you’d really like to be able to do: run a closed-loop agent-y (“agentic”? is that what we say now) configuration for an LLM, on a clean-slate Linux instance that spins up instantly and that can’t screw you over in any way. You get where we’re going with this.Anyways! I would like to register a concern.Emacs hosts the spiritual forebearer of remote editing systems, a blob of hyper-useful Elisp called “Tramp”. If you can hook Tramp up to any kind of interactive environment — usually, an SSH session — where it can run Bourne shell commands, it can extend Emacs to that environment.So, VSCode has a feature like Tramp. Which, neat, right? You’d think, take Tramp, maybe simplify it a bit, switch out Elisp for Typescript.Unlike Tramp, which lives off the land on the remote connection, VSCode mounts a full-scale invasion: it runs a Bash snippet stager that downloads an agent, including a binary installation of Node. The agent runs over port-forwarded SSH. It establishes a WebSockets connection back to your running VSCode front-end. The underlying protocol on that connection can:Wander around the filesystem
Launch its own shell PTY processes
In security-world, there’s a name for tools that work this way. I won’t say it out loud, because that’s not fair to VSCode, but let’s just say the name is murid in nature.I would be a little nervous about letting people VSCode-remote-edit stuff on dev servers, and apoplectic if that happened during an incident on something in production. It turns out we don’t have to care about any of this to get a custom connection to a Fly Machine working in VSCode, so none of this matters in any kind of deep way, but: we’ve decided to just be a blog again, so: we had to learn this, and now you do too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s 7-Year Slog To Improve Chrome Extensions Still Hasn&apos;t Satisfied Developers</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/07/2246202/googles-7-year-slog-to-improve-chrome-extensions-still-hasnt-satisfied-developers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Register's Thomas Claburn reports: Google's overhaul of Chrome's extension architecture continues to pose problems for developers of ad blockers, content filters, and privacy tools. [...] While Google's desire to improve the security, privacy, and performance of the Chrome extension platform is reasonable, its approach -- which focuses on code and permissions more than human oversight -- remains a work-in-progress that has left extension developers frustrated.
 
Alexei Miagkov, senior staff technology at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who oversees the organization's Privacy Badger extension, told The Register, "Making extensions under MV3 is much harder than making extensions under MV2. That's just a fact. They made things harder to build and more confusing." Miagkov said with Privacy Badger the problem has been the slowness with which Google addresses gaps in the MV3 platform. "It feels like MV3 is here and the web extensions team at Google is in no rush to fix the frayed ends, to fix what's missing or what's broken still." According to Google's documentation, "There are currently no open issues considered a critical platform gap," and various issues have been addressed through the addition of new API capabilities.
 
Miagkov described an unresolved problem that means Privacy Badger is unable to strip Google tracking redirects on Google sites. "We can't do it the correct way because when Google engineers design the [chrome.declarativeNetRequest API], they fail to think of this scenario," he said. "We can do a redirect to get rid of the tracking, but it ends up being a broken redirect for a lot of URLs. Basically, if the URL has any kind of query string parameters -- the question mark and anything beyond that -- we will break the link." Miagkov said a Chrome developer relations engineer had helped identify a workaround, but it's not great. Miagkov thinks these problems are of Google's own making -- the company changed the rules and has been slow to write the new ones. "It was completely predictable because they moved the ability to fix things from extensions to themselves," he said. "And now they need to fix things and they're not doing it."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elf Beauty shares crater; company in part blames TikTok, LA fires | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGt-LVlHnG8</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iGt-LVlHnG8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 01:22:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shares of cosmetics company Elf Beauty plunged after it cut its annual net sales and profit forecasts.

Toil can never be totally eliminated.Very often, the biggest toil center for a team at a growing company will be its procedure for modifying infrastructure or its procedure for provisioning user accounts. Partial instructions for the latter might look like this:Create an SSH key pair for the user.Commit the public key to Git and push to master.Wait for the build job to finish.Find the user’s email address in the employee directory.Send the user their private key via 1Password.This is a relatively short example. Sometimes there are 20 steps in the process. Sometimes there are branches and special cases to keep track of as you go. Over time, these procedures can become unmanageably large and complex.Procedures like this are frustrating because they’re focus-intensive yet require very little thought. They demand our full attention, but our attention isn’t rewarded with interesting problems or satisfying solutions – just another checkbox checked. I have a word for a procedure like this: a .We know that this procedure is ripe for automation. We can easily see how to automate any given step. And we know that a computer could carry out the instructions with far greater speed and accuracy than we can, and with less tendency toward practical drift.However, automating slogs sometimes feels like an all-or-nothing proposition. Sure, we could write a script to handle step 2, or step 5. But that wouldn’t  make the procedure any less cumbersome. It would lead to a proliferation of single-purpose scripts with different conventions and expectations, and you’d still have to follow a documented multi-step procedure for using those scripts.This perception of futility is the problem we really need to solve in order to escape from these manual slogs. I’ve found an approach that works pretty reliably: .Almost any slog can be turned into a . A do-nothing script is a script that encodes the instructions of a slog, encapsulating each step in a function. For the example procedure above, we could write the following do-nothing script:import sys

def wait_for_enter():
    raw_input("Press Enter to continue: ")

class CreateSSHKeypairStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Run:")
        print("   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/{0}".format(context["username"]))
        wait_for_enter()

class GitCommitStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Copy ~/new_key.pub into the `user_keys` Git repository, then run:")
        print("    git commit {0}".format(context["username"]))
        print("    git push")
        wait_for_enter()

class WaitForBuildStep(object):
    build_url = "http://example.com/builds/user_keys"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Wait for the build job at {0} to finish".format(self.build_url))
        wait_for_enter()

class RetrieveUserEmailStep(object):
    dir_url = "http://example.com/directory"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to {0}".format(self.dir_url))
        print("Find the email address for user `{0}`".format(context["username"]))
        context["email"] = raw_input("Paste the email address and press enter: ")

class SendPrivateKeyStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to 1Password")
        print("Paste the contents of ~/new_key into a new document")
        print("Share the document with {0}".format(context["email"]))
        wait_for_enter()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = {"username": sys.argv[1]}
    procedure = [
        CreateSSHKeypairStep(),
        GitCommitStep(),
        WaitForBuildStep(),
        RetrieveUserEmailStep(),
        SendPrivateKeyStep(),
    ]
    for step in procedure:
        step.run(context)
    print("Done.")
This script doesn’t actually  any of the steps of the procedure. That’s why it’s called a do-nothing script. It feeds the user a step at a time and waits for them to complete each step manually.At first glance, it might not be obvious that this script provides value. Maybe it looks like all we’ve done is make the instructions harder to read. But the value of a do-nothing script is immense:It’s now much less likely that you’ll lose your place and skip a step. This makes it easier to maintain focus and power through the slog.Each step of the procedure is now encapsulated in a function, which makes it possible to replace the text in any given step with code that performs the action automatically.Over time, you’ll develop a library of useful steps, which will make future automation tasks more efficient.A do-nothing script doesn’t save your team any manual effort. It lowers the activation energy for automating tasks, which allows the team to eliminate toil over time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hegseth: &apos;Diversity is our strength&apos; is dumbest phrase in military history</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfEi72hPHZY</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/GfEi72hPHZY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 19:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 7 chided past celebrations of the U.S. military's diversity in an address to Pentagon staff in which he also promised a tough approach to NATO and accountability over the war in Afghanistan.

involved, it's feasible for cities to create their own utility and undercut
PG&E's rates. When the savings per household are around $800-$1200 per
year, though, they should take it seriously.Here are the basic components of how much it costs to get electricity to your
house. The cost to actually generate the electricity in a power plant
or utility-scale solar farm. This varies by time of day but typically costs
about 4 cents per kilowatt hour; you can see the current wholesale rate on the
CAISO website. How much it costs to move the power from the power source to
a local substation/transformer, over large transmission lines. PG&E breaks this
out in its detailed rate chart at about 4 cents per kilowatt hour. How much to get the power from your local substation to your
house over local power lines. In PG&E's rate chart, they charge 20 cents per
kilowatt hour for this. That just does not match up with how much it actually
costs them to transmit power over local lines and keep the lines maintained. Operations, maintenance, profit. This is where PG&E is
actually seeing large expenses, because their coverage area is massive, it
costs a lot of money to deliver power to rural customers, and they are also
undertaking a massive project to underground utility lines in fire-prone areas.The high price and design of the electricity system have a number of bad
effects:People really hate inflation. When utility bills spike, it makes people
unhappy and also fuels the (not incorrect) perception that California is poorly
governed.Lower income people spend a higher percentage of their income on electricity,
so higher utility bills disproportionately hurt them.The net effect of charging higher rates to everyone to pay for undergrounding
is that people who live in urban areas are paying more money to subsidize
energy transmission for people who live in $2 million houses in places like the
Berkeley and Orinda hills. This makes no sense.Higher rates for electricity make electricity less competitive vs. gasoline
when people are considering a car purchase. It makes electricity less
competitive vs. natural gas for heating a house, heating water, or choosing a
laundry machine. As gas is warming the planet and electricity is substantially
easier to generate in abundance from renewable sources, it's just bad policy to
have high electricity rates.Let's walk through what this might look like for a particular city to undercut
PG&E's rates. I will pick Walnut Creek because it's a reasonably big city with
a good mix of detached homes and multifamily. Walnut Creek also has experience
with public ownership of amenities - the City operates a golf course and a
downtown parking garage with ground floor retail.There are a number of particular problems with applying PG&E's rates to Walnut
Creek:Walnut Creek is an urban area with a compact footprint that has little acreage
in a high severity wildfire zone. It has two transmission lines as well as a
local transformer grid along Ygnacio Valley Road. It is very cheap to transmit
power from power plants to Walnut Creek, and from transmission lines to every
house in Walnut Creek.Walnut Creek has an above average number of apartments. Apartments do not
have as much space for rooftop solar, and landlords don't have an incentive to
provide rooftop solar because they typically pass through utility costs. This
means NEM1 and NEM2 subsidies — 12% of the average non-solar bill
— disproportionately hurt Walnut Creek renters.Local businesses have disproportionately high energy costs. Safeway and Whole
Foods need to keep a row of refrigerators and freezers running 24/7. When they
pay PG&E's rates to do that, those high energy costs are passed through as
higher food prices.Palo Alto's total electric consumption was 830 gigawatt hours in 2024 - 19% of
this usage was residential, and 81% was businesses and industry uses. Applying
some adjustments for Walnut Creek - our population is bigger, it's a bit hotter
here, and energy use has increased - let's say Walnut Creek uses about 1150
gigawatt hours per year.Palo Alto earned $172 million in revenue for 830 gigawatt hours, which is about
20 cents per kilowatt hour.Here's where Palo Alto's utility company spends money:Acquisition of the network and financing costThe first thing you need to do is buy out PG&E's distribution network - all of
the power poles and local equipment that sits between the transmission lines and
people's houses. San Francisco proposed buying this for $2.5 billion in 2019;
PG&E rejected this offer for being too low. Adjusted for inflation and Walnut
Creek's population, this is about $230 million, let's round up and say $350
million. Let's also assume it costs $50 million in startup costs and one time
expenses to hire utility staff, buy equipment, marketing expense.Cities with an AA credit rating can issue a 30 year loan at about 4% interest.
Borrowing $400 million would cost about $23 million per year in interest and
principal payments.$23 million per year of financing cost spread across 1150 gigawatt hours is
only about 2 cents per kilowatt hour.Generation and distributionPalo Alto spent $114 million buying energy in 2024, about 14 cents per kilowatt
hour. Let's assume Walnut Creek can get power for about 17 cents per kWh.This covers customer service, financial management, billing, engineering work
for maintenance (tree trimming etc), and resource management. Palo Alto spent
$65 million on these expenses in 2023. Let's assume Walnut Creek's costs are
much higher at $90 million per year. This is about 8 cents per kilowatt hour.Another $25 million per year is allocated for grid modernization,
undergrounding, and reliability work. Let's assume this is $35 million per year
for Walnut Creek, which would be about 3 cents per kilowatt hour.Adding this up, we get 30 cents per kilowatt hour, which is ten cents lower than
PG&E's base rate and about 15 cents lower than PG&E's blended rate. At 1150
gigawatt hours, this would save Walnut Creek residential ratepayers about $23
million per year in total, about $800 per ratepayer, and Walnut Creek businesses
about $92 million per year. That is a  amount of money that could go
toward much more productive uses - paying higher salaries, lowering prices for
goods, spending more at local businesses.Most elected officials would jump at the chance to mail every household a $800
check every year. The next best thing is to put $800 back in their pocket.Other Benefits for Walnut CreekThere are huge ancilliary benefits for Walnut Creek to running its own utility
network.Green infrastructure investments: Walnut Creek has made sustainability a
key priority. Palo Alto owns a share in a hydroelectric dam, and Santa Clara
owns a share in a geothermal plant. At a time when there are exciting new
technologies that have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
deliver clean, cheap energy to residents - things like Fervo Energy that use
the tech behind fracking to deliver geothermal power - Walnut
Creek can use its very low cost of capital to finance these investments. This
is something PG&E cannot do as effectively, because as a public utility with
massive amounts of debt and wildfire liability, their borrowing cost is much
higher. Public ownership would enable transformative green energy investments
with a low borrowing cost.Encouraging the green transition: A 25% reduction in the cost of
electricity relative to natural gas would make electric upgrades like heat pump
water heaters or electric cars much more financially prudent investments. Like every city in California, Walnut Creek has boom
and bust cycles. Utilities have much more stable revenues than cities. Walnut
Creek could borrow from its utility in recessions, and loan money during booms. Walnut Creek has a number of unincorporated
pockets (San Miguel CDP, Shell Ridge CDP) that
administratively make little sense - they are served by different police,
they have different tax rules. If these homes could save $800 per year on
their utility bill by joining Walnut Creek, this may provide an incentive to
incorporate, which would ultimately lead to better governance.Even if Walnut Creek doesn't ultimately pursue its own utility, just
investigating the possibility may lead PG&E to offer concessions such as
undergrounding the transmission line over downtown. Because you can't
build under a transmission line, this makes a 100 foot wide strip of very
valuable land undevelopable. St. Paul's would love to redevelop its parking
lot under the transmission line for affordable housing, but can only develop
tiny corners of the lot with the transmission line overhead. Undergrounding
the line would deliver huge benefits to Walnut Creek.Lowering the cost of urban living in safe places: PG&E's current rate
structure has urban rate payers subsidize rural rate payers and people who live
in wildfire zones in e.g. the Orinda Hills, who need substantial investment in
order to receive power without sparking wildfires. This is bad policy - instead
of subsidizing fire zones, it should be cheap to live in safe places and more
expensive to live in dangerous places. Lower cost of electricity would reverse
these trends.California is kneecapping its own climate transition with high electricity
prices. The resulting inflation hurts our state's ability to retain a high
class, diverse workforce. Perversely, it also serves as a subsidy to wildfire
zones at the expense of infill areas. It's time to reverse those trends and
deliver lower energy prices in places we want more Californians to live.What should I do if I want this to happen? Cities around the region are
doing "priority setting" exercises for 2025. Contact your Mayor or City
Council and ask them to explore the possibility of creating their own utility,
potentially partnering with other cities. I would probably select cities that do
not have large fire zones (ie, not Orinda or Moraga).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Abandoned Ancestor of José Andrés Became a Baker! | Finding Your Roots | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBqXOEoFzLE</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/fBqXOEoFzLE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 17:00:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/3TA8505 | #FindingYourRoots

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?

Filmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. 

Emilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.

In this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. 

The film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.

Imagine you do an experiment, then you move 10 meters to the left and do it again. The results of the experiment don’t change, because the laws of physics don’t change from place to place. This is called translation symmetry.Now wait a few days and repeat your experiment again. The results don’t change, because the laws of physics don’t change as time passes. This is called time-translation symmetry.Noether started with symmetries like these and explored their mathematical consequences. She worked with established physics using a common mathematical description of a physical system, called a Lagrangian.This is where Noether’s insight went beyond the symbols on the page. On paper, symmetries seem to have no impact on the physics of the system, since symmetries don’t affect the Lagrangian. But Noether realized that symmetries must be mathematically important, since they constrain how a system can behave. She worked through what this constraint should be, and out of the mathematics of the Lagrangian popped a quantity that can’t change. That quantity corresponds to the physical property that’s conserved. The impact of symmetry had been hiding beneath the equations all along, just out of view.In the case of translation symmetry, the system’s total momentum should never change. For time-translation symmetry, a system’s total energy is conserved. Noether discovered that conservation laws aren’t fundamental axioms of the universe. Instead, they emerge from deeper symmetries.The conceptual consequences are hard to overstate. Physicists of the early 20th century were shocked to realize that a system that breaks time-translation symmetry can break energy conservation along with it. We now know that our own universe does this. The cosmos is expanding at an accelerating rate, stretching out the leftover light from the early universe. The process reduces the light’s energy as time passes.“Before Noether’s theorem, the principle of conservation of energy was shrouded in mystery,” the physicist and mathematician Feza Gürsey wrote in 1983. “… Noether’s simple and profound mathematical formulation did much to demystify physics.”Noether’s theorem has shaped the quantum world too. In the 1970s, it played a big role in the construction of the Standard Model of particle physics. The symmetries of quantum fields dictate laws that restrict how fundamental particles behave. For instance, a symmetry in the electromagnetic field forces particles to conserve their charge.“There’s a lot we have left to learn by thinking hard about Noether’s theorem,” the mathematical physicist John Baez said. “It has layers and layers of depth to it.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Asahi Linux Lead Developer Hector Martin Steps Down As Upstream Apple Silicon Maintainer</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Asahi-Linux-Lead-No-Upstream</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 13:32:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Following arguments on the Linux kernel mailing list the past few days over some Linux kernel maintainers being against the notion of Rust code in the mainline Linux kernel and trying to avoid it and very passionate views over the Linux kernel development process, Asahi Linux lead developer Hector Martin has removed himself from being an upstream maintainer of the ARM Apple code...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Asahi Linux lead developer Hector Martin resigns from Linux kernel</title><link>https://lkml.org/lkml/2025/2/7/9</link><author>Mond_</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 13:02:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process orcommunity management approach.Apple/ARM platform development will continue downstream.

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known.

Critics have labeled the legislation the "Snooper's Charter," as it authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence.An Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the revelation, though the law actually makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government even made such a demand. Likewise, the Home Office told the publication that its policy was not to discuss any technical demands. "We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices," a spokesman said.One of the people briefed on the situation, a consultant advising the United States on encryption matters, said Apple would be barred from warning its users that its most advanced encryption no longer provided full security. The person deemed it shocking that the UK government was demanding Apple's help to spy on non-British users without their governments' knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.Apple May Drop UK iCloud Services Over Secret Encryption Access OrderApple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the UK, rather than break the security promises it made to its users, people familiar with the matter told the publication. However, that would not affect the UK order for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States. Apple has previously said it would consider pulling services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.The order would compromise Apple's Advanced Data Protection, which the company launched in 2022. The feature gives users the option to end-to-end encrypt many additional iCloud data categories, including Photos, Notes, Voice Memos, Messages backups, device backups, and more, making their data inaccessible to anyone else – including Apple.Google has enforced default encryption for Android phone backups since 2018. When asked by  whether any government had requested a backdoor, Google spokesman Ed Fernandez did not provide a direct answer but suggested none exist: "Google cannot access Android end-to-end encrypted backup data, even with a legal order," he stated.The IPA was updated in 2023 to allow the Home Office to outlaw certain encrypted services using a technical capability notice. Apple at the time called the then proposed amendments "an unprecedented overreach by the government," saying that if the update was enacted, "the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers."Apple CEO Tim Cook has consistently insisted that providing back-door access past its encryption for authorities would open the door for "bad guys" to gain access to its users' data. Cyber security experts agree that it would only be a matter of time before bad actors discover such a point of entry. Apple's stance was enhanced in 2016 when it successfully fought a US order to unlock the iPhone of a shooter in San Bernardino, California.US law enforcement's longstanding objections to encryption have recently taken a backseat to concerns over large-scale cyber intrusions attributed to Chinese state-backed hackers. The attackers infiltrated major telecommunications providers, granting them unfettered access to private phone calls. During a December press conference alongside FBI officials, a Department of Homeland Security representative cautioned Americans against assuming traditional phone networks offer privacy, instead advising them to use encrypted communication whenever feasible.That same month, the FBI, National Security Agency, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint advisory detailing numerous countermeasures against the Chinese cyber campaign. Among their recommendations: "Ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible."In a statement, privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch said: "This misguided attempt at tackling crime and terrorism will not make the UK safer, but it will erode the fundamental rights and civil liberties of the entire population."Note: Due to the political or social nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Political News forum.

Well, that's the hope at least. In addition to some early fixes last week, some additional Bcachefs fixes are now pending for merging to the mainline kernel while continuing to track down some other bugs...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Meta torrented &amp; seeded 81.7 TB dataset containing copyrighted data</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/meta-torrented-over-81-7tb-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-authors-say/</link><author>gameshot911</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 11:26:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Emails discussing torrenting prove that Meta knew it was "illegal," authors alleged. And Bashlykov's warnings seemingly landed on deaf ears, with authors alleging that evidence showed Meta chose to instead hide its torrenting as best it could while downloading and seeding terabytes of data from multiple shadow libraries as recently as April 2024.Meta allegedly concealed seedingSupposedly, Meta tried to conceal the seeding by not using Facebook servers while downloading the dataset to "avoid" the "risk" of anyone "tracing back the seeder/downloader" from Facebook servers, an internal message from Meta researcher Frank Zhang said, while describing the work as being in "stealth mode." Meta also allegedly modified settings "so that the smallest amount of seeding possible could occur," a Meta executive in charge of project management, Michael Clark, said in a deposition.Now that new information has come to light, authors claim that Meta staff involved in the decision to torrent LibGen must be deposed again because the new facts allegedly "contradict prior deposition testimony."Mark Zuckerberg, for example, claimed to have no involvement in decisions to use LibGen to train AI models. But unredacted messages show the "decision to use LibGen occurred" after "a prior escalation to MZ," authors alleged.Meta did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment and has maintained throughout the litigation that AI training on LibGen was "fair use."However, Meta has previously addressed its torrenting in a motion to dismiss filed last month, telling the court that "plaintiffs do not plead a single instance in which any part of any book was, in fact, downloaded by a third party from Meta via torrent, much less that Plaintiffs’ books were somehow distributed by Meta."While Meta may be confident in its legal strategy despite the new torrenting wrinkle, the social media company has seemingly complicated its case by allowing authors to expand the distribution theory that's key to winning a direct copyright infringement claim beyond just claiming that Meta's AI outputs unlawfully distributed their works.As limited discovery on Meta's seeding now proceeds, Meta is not fighting the seeding aspect of the direct copyright infringement claim at this time, telling the court that it plans to "set... the record straight and debunk... this meritless allegation on summary judgment."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NVIDIA Publishes RTX Neural Texture Compression &quot;RTXNTC&quot; Beta</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-RTXNTC-0.5-Beta</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 11:22:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[NVIDIA on Thursday published their first public beta of their RTX Neural Texture Compression "RTX NTC" software development kit...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMDVLK 2025.Q1.1 Brings New Performance Tuning &amp; Fixes</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMDVLK-2025.Q1.1-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 10:54:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AMDVLK 2025.Q1.1 is out this morning as the first update of the year to this official AMD open-source Vulkan driver for Linux systems...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why China’s Luxury Boom Is Over</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waY0UMiSOgI</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/waY0UMiSOgI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Feb 2025 09:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The global luxury market has been booming for more than a decade, pushing up the values of companies such as LVMH and Kering.

Between 1947 and 1967, black-owned homes in Birmingham, Alabama were bombed over 50 times. Homes on Center Street were targeted so often, the neighborhood became known as ‘Dynamite Hill.’ What happened on Center Street is a scar on American history, but the voices of Dynamite Hill speak with strength and grace about how they faced unimaginable hatred, with one repeated refrain: “I’m still here.”

Predestination is ultimate destiny, fate. It is the claim by some religions that a Supreme Being, whether a personal God or a cosmic force, has determined for individual lives their ultimate course. When God foreordains, whether for salvation or for damnation, nothing can resist. Is this fair? Does this make sense? Would you like such a God?

The conflict centers on a proposed patch enabling Rust-written device drivers to access the kernel's DMA API, which Hellwig strongly opposed. While the dispute isn't about Rust itself, Hellwig argues that maintaining cross-language codebases severely compromises Linux's integrated nature. From a report: "Don't force me to deal with your shiny language of the day," he [Hellwig] wrote. "Maintaining multi-language projects is a pain I have no interest in dealing with. If you want to use something that's not C, be that assembly or Rust, you write to C interfaces and deal with the impedance mismatch yourself as far as I'm concerned." This resistance follows the September departure of Microsoft engineer Wedson Almeida Filho from the Rust for Linux project, citing "nontechnical nonsense."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: An API that takes a URL and returns a file with browser screenshots</title><link>https://github.com/US-Artificial-Intelligence/scraper</link><author>gkamer8</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:48:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: SQLite disk page explorer</title><link>https://github.com/QuadrupleA/sqlite-page-explorer</link><author>QuadrupleA</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:40:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google finally shipped some fire…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xbh9LUYn0</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/k9xbh9LUYn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Feb 2025 18:26:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deploy your app without complexity using Sevalla http://bit.ly/4hDju8W

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.

Professor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein’s works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. 

Suzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII’s inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. 

And there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein’s genius.

But a Bloomberg investigation reveals that several private hospital companies funded by the IFC have kept patients in their care until they can cover their bills or otherwise satisfy the hospital they will be able to pay. This policy can, at times, keep people from going home many days after they are medically ready for discharge. One healthcare company in the Philippines says it’s just following the law.

Using modern genetic techniques, they’re extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?

Findings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. 

In Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator’s genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. 

And biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. 

However, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?

Is God, if there is a God, the ‘God of History’? Does God make specific interventions in the course of human events to ensure that God’s purpose be fulfilled, for nations as well as for individuals? Or did God so set the laws of nature before the foundation of the world such that God’s goals would be achieved without God’s special, active interventions?

In a  leaderboard, updates happen almost instantly:A player’s score changes (e.g., after scoring a point or defeating an opponent).The system updates that player’s rank immediately.Other players can see the updated position without waiting or refreshing.This real-time aspect makes the user experience more dynamic and engaging. However, it also introduces significant , such as:Efficiently retrieving Top-N players (e.g., Top 10 or Top 100).Allowing players to quickly find their own rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.In this article, we will explore how to design a , , and  that can support above queries and enhance the user experience.Before diving into the design, lets clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of our real-time gaming leaderboard..: Display top N players (e.g., top 10, top 100) on the leaderboard and update it in real-time.: Allow a player to query their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard. Provide the ability to retrieve a “slice” of the leaderboard around a specific player (e.g., ranks 45 to 55 if the player is rank 50). Players can view past game scores and historical leaderboards for previous matches.Non-Functional Requirements Score changes should reflect immediately in the leaderboard.: Leaderboard queries should return the results in milliseconds.: System should support thousands of concurrent players submitting scores and fetching rankings.Approach to Designing the SystemThe most challenging aspects of building a real-time leaderboard is . Choosing the right storage system is critical to ensuring that queries can be executed efficiently without performance bottlenecks.To simplify the design process, we will follow below approach:Clearly define the input/output structure of leaderboard queries and updates.Define the High-Level Architecture: Identify core system components and their interactions.Choose the appropriate storage model optimized for fast leaderboard lookups and real-time updates.To support real-time leaderboard operations, we define a set of  that allow players to update scores, retrieve rankings, and query nearby ranks efficiently.Updates a player's score incrementally: POST /leaderboard/score/update{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "scoreDelta": 50
}We will use relative score updates () rather than absolute updates.{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "updatedScore": 1000,
  "currentRank": 10
}Retrieves the top-N players from the leaderboard, ranked by their scores.: GET /leaderboard/top?n=10:  = number of top players to fetch (default 10, max 100, etc.){
  "leaderboardId": "global",
  "topPlayers": [
    { "playerId": "playerA", "score": 1500, "rank": 1 },
    { "playerId": "playerB", "score": 1490, "rank": 2 },
    // ...
  ]
}Allows a player to retrieve their current rank without scanning the entire leaderboard.: GET /leaderboard/rank/{playerId}{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "score": 1000,
  "rank": 10
}Retrieves players ranked around a given player, allowing for comparison with competitors of similar skill levels.: GET /leaderboard/nearby/{playerId}?range=5:  indicates how many ranks above and below to fetch (e.g., 5 above, 5 below).{
  "playerId": "player123",
  "startRank": 45,

WSJ’s Jonathan Cheng traveled to the world’s largest wholesale market called the Yiwu International Trade Market to see how these products are making their way into U.S. markets. If you’ve ever bought anything on Temu or Shein, there’s a good chance it came from this bazaar near China’s east coast, which is close to huge ports in Shanghai and Ningbo. 

WSJ explores why this market in China, the center point of global wholesale trade, has found itself in the U.S. government’s crosshairs.

The reason, we suspect, is because folks often forget the order of arrays that come out. We know that `X_train` comes first, but then what? Is it `y_train` or `X_test`? This video explains the reasoning and also does a deep dive on the implementation.

The move has been criticized as an attempt to either stall or water down legal action against the database goliath over the programming language's name. Deno Land, the outfit behind the Deno JavaScript runtime, filed a petition with the USPTO back in November in an effort to make the trademarked term available to the JavaScript community. This legal effort is led by Node.js creator and Deno Land CEO Ryan Dahl, summarized on the JavaScript.tm website, and supported by more than 16,000 members of the JavaScript community. It aims to remove the fear of an Oracle lawsuit for using the term "JavaScript" in a conference title or business venture.
 
"Programmers working with JavaScript have formed innumerable community organizations," the website explains. "These organizations, like the standards bodies, have been forced to painstakingly avoid naming the programming language they are built around -- for example, JSConf. Sadly, without risking a legal trademark challenge against Oracle, there can be no 'JavaScript Conference' nor a 'JavaScript Specification.' The world's most popular programming language cannot even have a conference in its name." [...] In the initial trademark complaint, Deno Land makes three arguments to invalidate Oracle's ownership of "JavaScript." The biz claims that JavaScript has become a generic term; that Oracle committed fraud in 2019 when it applied to renew its trademark; and that Oracle has abandoned its trademark because it does not offer JavaScript products or services.
 
Oracle's motion on Monday focuses on the dismissal of the fraud claim, while arguing that it expects to prevail on the other two claims, citing corporate use of the trademarked term "in connection with a variety of offerings, including its JavaScript Extension Toolkit as well as developer's guides and educational resources, and also that relevant consumers do not perceive JavaScript as a generic term." The fraud claim follows from Deno Land's assertion that the material Oracle submitted in support of its trademark renewal application has nothing to do with any Oracle product. "Oracle, through its attorney, submitted specimens showing screen captures of the Node.js website, a project created by Ryan Dahl, Petitioner's Chief Executive Officer," the trademark cancellation petition says. "Node.js is not affiliated with Oracle, and the use of screen captures of the 'nodejs.org' website as a specimen did not show any use of the mark by Oracle or on behalf of Oracle."
 
Oracle contends that in fact it submitted two specimens to the USPTO -- a screenshot from the Node.js website and another from its own Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit. And this, among other reasons, invalidates the fraud claim, Big Red's attorneys contend. "Where, as here, Registrant 'provided the USPTO with [two specimens]' at least one of which shows use of the mark in commerce, Petitioner cannot plausibly allege that the inclusion of a second, purportedly defective specimen, was material," Oracle's motion argues, adding that no evidence of fraudulent intent has been presented. Beyond asking the court to toss the fraud claim, Oracle has requested an additional thirty days to respond to the other two claims.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Sports Teams Can Learn from Tiktok Star Josh Richards | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDkTJUzRod0</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uDkTJUzRod0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 23:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with entrepreneur Josh Richards to discuss his social media empire.

Uncover new archaeological evidence rewriting our understanding of the Dark Ages in 5th- and 6th-century Britain that might also explain the legend of King Arthur. [Originally aired in 2019]

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.

I was really happy with it, both for work and personal computing needs. Estonian ID card software was also officially supported on Ubuntu, which made Ubuntu a good choice for family members. 

But then something changed. Ounapuu recounts how Ubuntu's bi-annual long-term support releases consistently broke functionality, from minor interface glitches to catastrophic system failures that left computers unresponsive. His breaking point came after multiple problematic upgrades affecting family members' computers, including one that rendered a laptop completely unusable during an upgrade from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04. Another incident left a relative's system with broken Firefox shortcuts and duplicate status bar icons after updating Lubuntu 18.04. 

Canonical's aggressive push of Snap packages has drawn particular criticism. The forced migration of system components from traditional Debian packages to Snaps resulted in compatibility issues, broken desktop shortcuts, and government ID card authentication failures. In one instance, he writes, a Snap-related bug in the GNOME desktop environment severely disrupted workplace productivity, requiring multiple system restarts to resolve. The author has since switched to Fedora, praising its implementation of Flatpak as a superior alternative to Snaps.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tell HN: Cloudflare is blocking Pale Moon and other non-mainstream browsers</title><link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953508</link><author>Hold-And-Modify</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 19:08:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello.Cloudflare's Browser Intergrity Check/Verification/Challenge feature used by many websites, is denying access to users of non-mainstream browsers like Pale Moon.Users reports began on January 31:This situation occurs at least once a year, and there is no easy way to contact Cloudflare.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Germany before the election - Between hopes and fears | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOQqeKbWxH4</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HOQqeKbWxH4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 17:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[War in the Middle East, war in Ukraine, migration, rising prices, and more – plenty of reasons for Germany to worry, and just as many to take action.

Following the collapse of Germany’s governing coalition in the fall, early parliamentary elections are now due to take place at the end of February. DW reporters Oxana Evdokimova and Carolina Machhaus  traveled around Germany, speaking to people who are worried about what the future holds, but who are also tackling and helping to solve problems. According to one survey, the cost of living and the gap between rich and poor are particularly problematic in Germany. Food prices, for example, have risen by around a third since 2020.. Munich food bank founder Hannelore Kiethe says that demand has been rising ever since its founding. Affordable housing is another issue that concerns people in Germany, especially in the big cities. Christa Lippmann has founded a housing project for single women, with success. Dietmar Kibbel is concerned that Germany does not have enough skilled workers to get the economy moving again and is involved in a program for applicants to qualify as train drivers within a year — a highly skilled profession and one that is highly in demand across the country. It is an opportunity for Abdullah Alyaqub, who fled his home country of Syria ten years ago and hopes that his new job will give him more financial security.

responses. Along the way I learned that classifying qualitative data is not
easy but I gave it my best shot. I ended up building a custom
tool to make it faster to categorize
everything.As with all of my surveys the methodology isn’t particularly scientific. I just
posted the survey to Mastodon and Twitter, ran it for a couple of days, and got
answers from whoever happened to see it and felt like responding.Here are the top categories of frustrations!I think it’s worth keeping in mind while reading these comments that40% of people answering this survey have been using the terminal for 95% of people answering the survey have been using the terminal for at least 4 yearsThese comments aren’t coming from total beginners.Here are the categories of frustrations! The number in brackets is the number
of people with that frustration. I’m mostly writing this up for myself because
I’m trying to write a zine about the terminal and I wanted to get a sense for
what people are having trouble with.People talked about struggles remembering:the syntax for CLI tools like awk, jq, sed, etckeyboard shortcuts for tmux, text editing, etcThere are just so many little “trivia” details to remember for full
functionality. Even after all these years I’ll sometimes forget where it’s 2
or 1 for stderr, or forget which is which for  and .switching terminals is hard (91)People talked about struggling with switching systems (for example home/work
computer or when SSHing) and running into:OS differences in keyboard shortcuts (like Linux vs Mac)systems which don’t have their preferred text editor (“no vim” or “only vim”)different versions of the same command (like Mac OS grep vs GNU grep)a shell they aren’t used to (“the subtle differences between zsh and bash”)as well as differences inside the same system like pagers being not consistent
with each other (git diff pagers, other pagers).I got used to fish and vi mode which are not available when I ssh into
servers, containers.Lots of problems with color, like:programs setting colors that are unreadable with a light background colorfinding a colorscheme they like (and getting it to work consistently across different apps)color not working inside several layers of SSH/tmux/etcnot wanting color at all and struggling to turn it offThis comment felt relatable to me:Getting my terminal theme configured in a reasonable way between the terminal
emulator and fish (I did this years ago and remember it being tedious and
fiddly and now feel like I’m locked into my current theme because it works
and I dread touching any of that configuration ever again).Half of the comments on keyboard shortcuts were about how on Linux/Windows, the
keyboard shortcut to copy/paste in the terminal is different from in the rest
of the OS.Some other issues with keyboard shortcuts other than copy/paste:using  in a browser-based terminal and closing the windowthe terminal only supports a limited set of keyboard shortcuts (no
, no , no , lots of  shortcuts aren’t
possible like )the OS stopping you from using a terminal keyboard shortcut (like by default
Mac OS uses  for something else)issues using emacs in the terminalbackspace not working (2)other copy and paste issues (75)Aside from “the keyboard shortcut for copy and paste is different”, there were
a lot of OTHER issues with copy and paste, like:how tmux and the terminal emulator both do copy/paste in different waysdealing with many different clipboards (system clipboard, vim clipboard, the
“middle click” clipboard on Linux, tmux’s clipboard, etc) and potentially
synchronizing themrandom spaces added when copying from the terminalpasting multiline commands which automatically get run in a terrifying waywanting a way to copy text without using the mouseThere were lots of comments about this, which all came down to the same basic
complaint – it’s hard to discover useful tools or features! This comment kind of
summed it all up:How difficult it is to learn independently. Most of what I know is an
assorted collection of stuff I’ve been told by random people over the years.steep learning curve (44)A lot of comments about it generally having a steep learning curve. A couple of
example comments:After 15 years of using it, I’m not much faster than using it than I was 5 or
maybe even 10 years ago.That I know I could make my life easier by learning more about the shortcuts
and commands and configuring the terminal but I don’t spend the time because it
feels overwhelming.Some issues with shell history:history not being shared between terminal tabs (16)limits that are too short (4)history not being restored when terminal tabs are restoredlosing history because the terminal crashednot knowing how to search historyIt wasted a lot of time until I figured it out and still annoys me that
“history” on zsh has such a small buffer;  I have to type “history 0” to get
any useful length of history.documentation being generally opaquelack of examples in man pagesprograms which don’t have man pagesHere’s a representative comment:Finding good examples and docs. Man pages often not enough, have to wade
through stack overflowA few issues with scrollback:programs printing out too much data making you lose scrollback historyresizing the terminal messes up the scrollbackGUI programs that you start in the background printing stuff out that gets in
the way of other programs’ outputsWhen resizing the terminal (in particular: making it narrower) leads to
broken rewrapping of the scrollback content because the commands formatted
their output based on the terminal window width.Lots of comments about how the terminal feels hampered by legacy decisions and
how users often end up needing to learn implementation details that feel very
esoteric. One example comment:Most of the legacy cruft, it would be great to have a green field
implementation of the CLI interface.Lots of complaints about POSIX shell scripting. There’s a general feeling that
shell scripting is difficult but also that switching to a different less
standard scripting language (fish, nushell, etc) brings its own problems.Shell scripting. My tolerance to ditch a shell script and go to a scripting
language is pretty low. It’s just too messy and powerful. Screwing up can be
costly so I don’t even bother.Some more issues that were mentioned at least 10 times:(31) inconsistent command line arguments: is it -h or help or –help?(24) keeping dotfiles in sync across different systems(23) performance (e.g. “my shell takes too long to start”)(20) window management (potentially with some combination of tmux tabs, terminal tabs, and multiple terminal windows. Where did that shell session go?)(17) generally feeling scared/uneasy (“The debilitating fear that I’m going
to do some mysterious Bad Thing with a command and I will have absolutely no
idea how to fix or undo it or even really figure out what happened”)(16) terminfo issues (“Having to learn about terminfo if/when I try a new terminal emulator and ssh elsewhere.”)(16) lack of image support (sixel etc)(15) SSH issues (like having to start over when you lose the SSH connection)(15) various tmux/screen issues (for example lack of integration between tmux and the terminal emulator)(13) the terminal getting messed up for various reasons (pressing , ing a binary, etc)(12) quoting/escaping in the shell(11) various Windows/PowerShell issuesThere were also 122 answers to the effect of “nothing really” or “only that I
can’t do EVERYTHING in the terminal”Think I’ve found work arounds for most/all frustrationsI’m not going to make a lot of commentary on these results, but here are a
couple of categories that feel related to me:remembering syntax & history (often the thing you need to remember is something you’ve run before!)discoverability & the learning curve (the lack of discoverability is definitely a big part of what makes it hard to learn)“switching systems is hard” & “it feels outdated” (tools that haven’t really
changed in 30 or 40 years have many problems but they do tend to be always
 no matter what system you’re on, which is very useful and makes them
hard to stop using)Trying to categorize all these results in a reasonable way really gave me an
appreciation for social science researchers’ skills.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Eggs US – Price – Chart</title><link>https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/eggs-us</link><author>throwaway5752</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 16:31:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The South Korean Daewoo K2 rifle with firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoUYo2ihDmM</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eoUYo2ihDmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 16:08:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As seen in Squid Game, this week Jonathan delves into the South Korean service rifle - the Daewoo K2.

To me personally, it feels unavoidable: I can’t look down at my phone or glance up at a TV without seeing  that makes me upset. And that’s really exhausting. But when outrage is everywhere, what can we do to keep it from getting to us?On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Here to talk to us about fighting so-called outrage fatigue is Tanya Lewis, a senior editor covering health and medicine at .Tanya, thanks for joining us today. Thanks so much for having me. So you recently wrote about this phenomenon called “outrage fatigue.” Could you tell us what that is? Sure, so outrage fatigue is kind of an informal concept, which basically refers to repeatedly experiencing perceived moral transgressions and feeling fatigued by them. So what that basically means is just, you know, you see something, you’re outraged by it, and over time you just become kind of numb to it. Sounds relevant to [laughs], to many of our lives. What do researchers know about outrage in general? So outrage fatigue itself hasn’t been that well-studied, but outrage in general has been studied, and people have found that, actually, outrage can be useful. It actually can help you identify a problem and react to it. But it can also be harmful if you’re experiencing it all the time and become overwhelmed by it.There’s actually a recent study by William Brady, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He and his colleagues found that outrage actually helps misinformation spread more widely, especially online on social media. So the upshot of this is that when you have too much outrage, people can actually withdraw from public spaces or virtual places like social media. Yeah, and what is it about outrage that helps misinformation spread? So I think part of it is the fact that it’s more engaging. It, you know, activates your emotions, and so people are more primed to respond to that. As we all know, if you’ve ever spent time on social media and social networks, we always see the most kind of inflammatory content because that’s what gets retweets or clicks and the algorithms are amplifying that. Right, and more broadly, you know, what is it about the times we’re living in that makes outrage so hard to avoid? So we’re living in a particularly polarized time, which I think is not a surprise to anybody. If you have been online lately, on Twitter or Facebook or TikTok or any other social media, you’ve probably seen people yelling about something or other. And this just really has been accelerating, I guess, in the last few years because of our political polarization and other world events.As I was saying earlier some amount of outrage is actually normal and healthy, but studies have shown that the majority of outrage posts on social media are actually driven by a small minority of users who are very—you know, they feel very strongly about something, and that can actually turn other people off of participating in the conversation. Yeah, so social media is a big part of this, you know, both amplifying it and giving a platform for people who are feeling this outrage. Other than just making us feel bad, what does outrage fatigue do to a person? So the real danger is that we become apathetic, and if we’re exposed to something all the time—whether it’s through social media or even traditional news sources like cable TV—if it’s constantly telling us to be outraged, eventually we’re gonna be less responsive and we’re gonna kind of pull back. So instead of, like, channeling that outrage into something useful, many people sort of feel exhausted and burned out, and they just don’t want to take action at all.And this is actually a problem because politicians can take advantage of that and sort of manipulate people. As we’ve seen over the last few decades some of the big social issues like abortion, gay rights, critical race theory, these have all been used as kind of wedge issues to convince people to vote in ways that might be against their own self-interest because they’re just so outraged about this one particular issue. Yeah, so definitely worth avoiding. What can we do to accomplish that? Right. That was my question, too. You know, a couple of things: one is that we can just sort of limit how much media we consume. As somebody who is a member of the media, you know, this might sound strange, but I think if you’re feeling constantly overwhelmed and outraged by something, if you consume less of it, that’s probably a good thing.But it doesn’t mean you should totally sort of ignore what’s happening. When I talked to William Brady, he said that, you know, one of the ways you can kind of have an impact without just being overwhelmed is to get involved in local politics or local issues, you know, in your community because you can actually have a much greater impact on a local level, usually, than a national level anyway. So rather than just, like, retweeting that most outrageous post that you see, you know, it’s better to get involved with real people and kind of have a dialogue with them. Yeah, find some mutual aid groups ... Find stuff you can actually do when you’re not doomscrolling and hopefully [laughs] ... Do less of the doomscrolling, too. And did he have any advice for sort of recovering from outrage burnout once it’s hit you? Gosh, that is a good question. You know, it’s not something I specifically asked Dr. Brady about, but I think, just from my own experience, like I said, you know, pulling back a little bit from some of the media consumption and, you know, just maybe limiting yourself to checking the news a couple times a day instead of, like, every hour or, you know, getting those alerts on your phone all the time. If someone is posting stuff that makes you furious all the time, maybe don’t follow them [laughs]. And, yeah, get outside, get in nature—you know, the usual things that can kind of reset your brain and make you feel, you know, more calm. Yeah, maybe easier said than done, but really good advice. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us, Tanya. Thanks so much. It’s always great being on here. That’s all for today’s episode.

In recent decades, Gassed was interpreted as a very yellow painting. But it didn’t always look like that. 

The yellow effect comes from a discoloured varnish from the 1970s, concealing Sargent’s intentions and skewing our interpretation of his work. Now, thanks to meticulous conservation efforts as part of IWM’s new Blavatnik Art, Film and Photography Galleries, Gassed and its meaning have been reborn.
 
Today we’re going to examine the history of Gassed, what it means, why it’s important, and how that has changed over 100 years on display.

By default, when someone uses command-line tools built into Go to download or install packages, requests are routed through the service. A description on the site says the proxy is provided by the Go team and “run by Google.”Since November 2021, the Go Module Mirror has been hosting a backdoored version of a widely used module, security firm Socket said Monday. The file uses “typosquatting,” a technique that gives malicious files names similar to widely used legitimate ones and plants them in popular repositories. In the event someone makes a typo or even a minor variation from the correct name when fetching a file with the command line, they land on the malicious file instead of the one they wanted. (A similar typosquatting scheme is common with domain names, too.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The BEST thing about the M4 Sherman</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIOV8ey1Lrw</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tIOV8ey1Lrw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 12:01:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Cat’s Nine Lives Inspire a Way to Quell Quantum Errors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-error</link><author>John Boyd</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjE1NDY3MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODk0NzY3OH0.hyWMjN77nXKClo7akyxT_W_D4MMmoDVBeCB3wvY99zo/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 12:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Antimony’s eight quantum states makes it harder for a qubit to flip]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: HN as TikTok, welcome to HN hell</title><link>https://hnhell.com/</link><author>sirobg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 11:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>S1: A $6 R1 competitor?</title><link>https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/02/03/s1</link><author>tkellogg</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 11:05:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A new paper released on Friday is making waves in the AI community, not because of the model 
it describes, but because it shows how close we are to some very large breakthroughs in AI. The model
is just below state of the art, but it can run on my laptop. More important, it sheds light on how all
this stuff works, and it’s .OpenAI were the first to claim the inference-time scaling laws. Basically, an LLM can get higher performance
if it can “think” longer before answering. But, like,  How do you make it think longer?OpenAI and R1 had cool graphs showing performance scaling with average thinking time (this from
the s1 paper):But  do they control the length of an LLM response? Everyone skipped over that part, but s1
shows us details, .Context: When an LLM “thinks” at inference time, it puts it’s thoughts inside  and 
 XML tags. Once it gets past the end tag the model is taught to change voice into a confident
and authoritative tone for the final answer.In s1, when the LLM tries to stop thinking with , they force it to keep going
by replacing it with . It’ll then begin to second guess and double check it’s answer. They
do this to trim or extend thinking time (trimming is just abruptly inserting ).So for  versus , that’s likely how they do it. They probably trained 3
models, and with each with a different average thinking time (as measured during training). Eventually the 
training process begins to encode that behavior into the model weights.The trick is so dumb you can do it at inference time too. I’m kicking myself for not understanding
this earlier, because it’s what entropix is all about, and I wrote a lot about entropix.In entropix, they look at the entropy & varentropy of the logits (and attention) to change how the
tokens are selected. In fact, they used tokens like “Wait” to force the LLM to second guess itself.
Although there was more to it, they also tweaked sampler setting to make
it more creative, or to go into aggressive exploration mode, all depending on the internal state
of the model.My hunch is that we’ll  of entropix, or something directly inspired from it. Although, it’s
unclear if it’ll appear predominately in training or inference time.Someone on LinkedIn showed me a piece about token forcing. They convince R1
to share everything it knows about Tiananmen Square by prefixing the bot message with . 
R1 then takes the suggestion and tells what it knows. They suggest that this could be a good 
introspection technique for understanding the models better.(R1 is a Chinese model and has been fine tuned to avoid talking about events like Tiananmen Square)Why did it cost only $6? Because they used a  and hardly any data.After sifting their dataset of 56K examples down to just the best 1K, they found that the core 1K 
is all that’s needed to achieve o1-preview performance on a 32B model. Adding data didn’t raise 
performance .32B is a small model, I can run that on my laptop. They used 16 NVIDIA H100s for 26 minutes per 
training run, that equates to around $6.The low cost means you can do a lot of runs, and they did. As we’ll see, they heavily used a 
technique called ablation, re-running the entire training process with  in 
configuration to prove what works and what doesn’t.For example, how did they figure out it should be “Wait” and not “Hmm”? They also measured properties of the training dataset, which examples provided the most signal:They did a ton of these ablation experiments. This is how you .We like to think that
OpenAI or DeepSeek are simply packed full of brilliant people and they make a wild guess, spend
$10,000,000.00 on a training run and BAM! an innovation is created. But no, even the smartest
people make hundreds of .Innovations like s1 that dramatically lower costs mean that researchers can learn and understand
these models faster. And that directly translates to a  of AI development.Again, AI is inseparable from politics, sorry.There’s debate about OpenAI & Anthropic’s vast funding. It’s tempting to see cost reducing 
innovations like s1 or DeepSeek V3 and assume that OpenAI & Anthropic’s vast datacenters are
a waste of money. I’d argue that no, having 10,000 H100s just means that you can do 625 times
 than s1 did.If you believe that AI development is a prime national security advantage, then you absolutely
should want even more money poured into AI development, to make it go .Note that this s1 dataset is . Every example is a thought trace generated by 
another model, Qwen2.5,
prompted to think before answering. OpenAI has been accusing DeepSeek of creating their
V3 model by distilling from o1, which is against their terms of service. There’s still no strong public
evidence in either direction, so accusations are mostly empty, but s1 gives a lot of credence.Going forward, it’ll be nearly impossible to prevent distealing (unauthorized distilling). One thousand
examples is definitely within the range of what a single person might do in normal usage, no less 
ten or a hundred people. I doubt that OpenAI has a realistic path to  or even 
distealing outside of simply not releasing models.Note that OpenAI released their o3 model as
deep research, an agent instead of direct access to the model API. This might be a trend now,
“agents” serving as a way to avoid releasing direct access to a model.S1 is important because it illustrates the current pace of AI development that’s happening in
the open. When you consider how much compute is available to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic,
the potential true pace of AI development is .S1 isn’t a replication of R1 or o1. Those were demonstrations in pure reinforcement learning (RL).
S1 shows that supervised fine tuning (SFT) shows just as much potential. That means researchers have
multiple paths to investigate for pushing forward inference-time scaling.I think it’s safe to say that we’re going to see some very big things in ‘25. It’s barely February…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Caves of Qud with Brian Bucklew</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/02/05/caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=caves-of-qud-with-brian-bucklew</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED9626101996.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 10:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Caves of Qud is a roguelike game set in a richly detailed, post-apocalyptic world blending science fiction and fantasy.

Moranda Reilly always wanted to work in aviation. She read books on aviation heroes, watched air disasters, she listened to live air traffic control in her car. Around her neck, she wore an airplane necklace, a gift from a friend that she’d mended repeatedly. In her 20s, she elected to take the plunge and do whatever it took to make it happen. She quit her full-time job, took out student loans, and moved to attend a university that offered a two-year degree as part of the FAA’s collegiate training initiative (CTI) for air traffic controllers. The FAA had established its CTI program in 1989, working together alongside a select group of universities and community colleges to build a better-prepared, college-educated workforce. By the early 2010s, when Moranda and other aspiring air traffic controllers entered the program, CTI was the primary way by which people would enter the field, with the FAA accepting virtually no off-the-street hires. On its website, the FAA instructed aspiring air traffic controllers that if they got CTI degrees, passed the profession’s aptitude test (the AT-SAT), and met other eligibility requirements, it would place them into a priority hiring queue, giving them first opportunity every time employment slots opened up. Students understood that the FAA hired virtually everyone who completed the program and passed the assessment.As the CTI program ramped up with increasing success in the mid-2000s, Florida State College of Jacksonville applied to join, and in 2008, Sam Fischer launched their program. By 2013, he had settled into a comfortable rhythm, training wave after wave of successful students.Andrew Brigida, a 2013 graduate from Arizona State’s CTI program, had just aced the AT-SAT, getting perfect marks while meeting all other job requirements. He was fully qualified, poised to become an air traffic controller.First, every past aptitude test applicants had taken was voided. Andrew Brigida’s perfect score was meaningless.Second, every applicant would be required to take and pass an unspecified “biographical questionnaire” to have a shot at entering the profession.Third, existing CTI students were left with no advantage in the hiring process, which would be equally open to all off-the-street applicants—their degrees rendered useless for the one specialized job they had trained for.The rules had changed, and students and program managers alike were left scrambling to figure out what was going on.Days after the announcement, Reilly launched a Facebook group for CTI students and instructors to grapple with what was happening. “This page doesn’t support the ‘angry mob’ mentality or anything but positive ‘We believe in CTI schools’ vibes,” she wrote. “We believe that all of the simulator hours spent, materials studied, and education taught in C.T.I. schools has value and is of worth.”More than a hundred people joined in the first day. Brigida and Fischer jumped on quickly, helping Reilly to organize the group and walking the anxious crowd through everything they were learning. Fischer provided status updates, Reilly jumped in with rallying cries and organization (“Save CTI! Save CTI! Save CTI!”), and Brigida gave the group a public face. The next hiring wave would be in February 2014, and the CTI graduates and students waited anxiously, grasping at every bit of information they could find to understand what was going on. As the hiring wave approached, some of Reilly’s friends in the program encouraged her to join the National Black Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees (NBCFAE), telling her it would help improve her chances of being hired. She signed up as the February wave started. Soon, though, she became uneasy with what the organization was doing, particularly after she and the rest of the group got a voice message from FAA employee Shelton Snow:hereReilly, Brigida, and thousands of others found themselves faced with the questionnaire, clicking through a bizarre sequence of questions that would determine whether they could enter the profession they’d been working towards. Faced with the opportunity to cheat, Reilly did not. It cost her a shot at becoming an air traffic controller. Like 85% of their fellow CTI students, Brigida and Reilly found themselves faced with a red exclamation point and a dismissal notice: “Based upon your responses to the Biographical Assessment, we have determined that you are NOT eligible for this position.”Their plans had been upended. No chance for appeal. No way around it short of waiting another year and trying again. Despite their qualifications and their passion, they would not be air traffic controllers.“You Have Been Intentionally Discriminated Against.”So what happened? Why did the FAA upend a stable hiring process, undercut the CTI schools it had established to train its workforce, and throw the plans of thousands of eager would-be air traffic controllers into disarray? I give a bare-bones accounting of the background in another article, but there are a few more details worth adding in this one.The CTI program was popular and successful before the barrier analysis. After 2013, though, the FAA began to treat its CTI schools as a liability. After the biographical questionnaire, per conversations with CTI administrators, the FAA simply tried to pretend the CTI schools did not exist. The FAA cut off communication, treating them tersely and with disdain. The schools were not bastions of privilege. The programs were often at community colleges and junior colleges, with diverse student bodies and professors who worked long hours helping them. They were successful and effective at what they did, and had provided a steady stream of applicants who saw a clear path into the profession. Suddenly, though, they were left scrambling to justify their existence. Fischer talks about how he used to get lots of calls from students asking how to become an air traffic controller, but after 2013, that mostly stopped. He emphasizes that the FAA was never there to give him a job, and if they wanted to change, that was their prerogative. A lot of the problem, and a lot of the sore feelings between the FAA and the CTI schools, came because of the abruptness of the change, the lack of communication, the sudden cutting off.Fischer, alongside other program directors like Joe Eichelberger, began to organize the CTI schools and take meticulous notes. What were success rates like before the scandal? What about after? What had happened, and why? How could they continue to justify their programs to students who could no longer trust that there would be jobs waiting at the other end? gave a few remarksIt’s an incredible safety concern… what we’re dealing with here is a shortage of air traffic controllers. We had a process by which to provide candidates, who were very well-qualified, who were spending a lot of money on their own… and the FAA has apparently decided to arbitrarily abandon that process. And now when you add onto it the cheating scandal, which clearly is a huge problem, and an FAA official who is trying to pretend it’s not part of what they have to worry about… that’s ludicrous.a lettermore specificallyAll of this is included in the investigation report.Why do we have access to the questionnaire, the investigation report, and other critical documents necessary to pull together this story? Ask Jorge Rojas. Jorge Rojas always wanted to be an air traffic controller. He went to CTI school right after high school and saw all of the 2014 chaos from a distance. In 2015, when he became eligible to take the questionnaire, he did so. Failed. Took it again in 2016. Failed. It was only after Congress explicitly passed a law rejecting the FAA’s use of the biographical questionnaire that he had an opportunity to enter the role. He worked for the FAA for five years before returning to become a government contractor. But he was frustrated—frustrated on his behalf, frustrated on the behalf of others who had had their lives thrown into turmoil. So he began filing FOIA requests.Rojas filed hundreds of requests over the course of multiple years. The FAA delayed some, rejected others, and per Rojas, took the stance that “he’s not going to sue us for all of them.” Sometimes, he even went back to FOIA his FOIAs, to see what was taking so long and how they were responding. Five separate times, he took the FAA to court over refusals and delays.After long delays and repeated sanctions, the FAA finally produced some of the key documents. He got the questionnaire, the answer key. He got the investigation into Shelton Snow. As of last year when I spoke with him, the FAA was still gradually, periodically, releasing documents to him, responding to FOIAs from back in 2016. Along the whole way, Michael Pearson, soon aided by attorneys from the Mountain States Legal Foundation, worked diligently on the case. Mountain States Legal Foundation is a small non-profit firm; the case is an ambitious one. They have spent years gathering evidence, arguing in court, pushing for class certification, and preparing to bring the case to trial. The case is scheduled to go to trial next year. a memorandumCaleb Benner, who graduated in 2012 from Purdue University’s Aviation Management program, one of the FAA’s designated CTI programs, spent his entire childhood dreaming of becoming an air traffic controller. When other kids responded “firefighter” or “police officer” when asked “What do you want to do when you grow up?”, he always said “air traffic controller.” He took the AT-SAT after graduation and got a score in the high 90s, only for hiring to be hit by sequestration before he could apply. When they came out of sequestration and he was preparing to apply properly, he learned about the Biographical Assessment after the New Year’s Eve announcement. He took it. He failed.After failing the assessment, he spent multiple years working a job paying $10 an hour, one he specifically chose so it would be easy to uproot and go to the Academy to train when he got the call. The call never came. Eventually, he gave up, paid to get his aircraft dispatcher’s license, and moved on. Benner hates that this accident brought the scandal to the forefront after a decade in the courts, and is not fond of how Trump has handled it. But, as he puts it, “That doesn’t change how blatantly wrong it was what the FAA did. And I spent what seems like every day of my career dealing with the consequences of those decisions.”Others tell similar stories. Another CTI grad tells me he became a police dispatcher (“to sate my need to talk into a headset for 8 hours a day”) and worked on getting a private rotorcraft license afterward—explained that he didn’t feel bitter, exactly, but he felt wronged. Robbed. Reilly has remained a passionate advocate for the issue over the years. She reached out to me almost immediately after I published my original article, providing an extensive look at the years of conversations, advocacy, and work the scandal has taken. She has moved on to work in air traffic management. She remains a passionate advocate for women in aviation and spends time volunteering on youth outreach programs. Last year, she organized an event at the Reagan airport in DC, busing in 150 girls from a Title 1 school. Many, she said, had never seen an airplane up close before. In a moment of dark irony, the sort of diversity-focused work she’s passionate about—not lowering the bar, but inspiring more people and providing them with mentorship and opportunity to reach it—is threatened by Trump’s memorandum. Has this had a long-term impact on aviation safety and air traffic controller shortages? Likely yes. An active air traffic controller reached out to me at the end of January last year, talking about his frustration that so many qualified individuals were eliminated from entering training, contributing to a dire staffing shortage. His facility was operating at less than 75%, with controllers fatigued from working 6-day weeks. As he explained it, training can take 1.5 to 2.5 years at larger facilities, with washout rates from 30-60%, and when we spoke upper level facilities were only accepting transfers from lower level facilities, adding years to preparation time. Every issue compounds and adds to the problem over time, and the FAA’s 2013 changes set staffing back years. The FAA, he said, simply is not bringing in enough people to match the number leaving, with some air traffic controllers believing the agency is failing on purpose to find an excuse to privatize them. A controller who worked for 25 years and retired in 2015 spoke with me last January as well. He had been offered a position at Oklahoma City to instruct new students. Per him, the ideal candidate can go from street to fully certified in about 4 years, while some trainees during his last few years had been training for 6-8 years. He alleged a pattern where some students were trained for years longer than others, rarely washed out, and were quietly checked out and promoted away from direct air traffic control positions into management.Another retired controller and supervisor who formerly worked at the Chicago ARTCC echoed his story, claiming the FAA would regularly change the “best qualified list,” with those responsible for promotions changing requirements depending on who they wanted to promote. He was never told to certify an inadequate trainee, he said, but “the pressure was mounting.”Applicant quality matters in several ways. Weaker applicants are more likely to drop out in training, to take longer going through the pipeline and in on-the-job training (where experienced controllers have to work directly with them, taking other bodies off the job), and to wind up working in less busy airfields. This matters particularly because there are fixed numbers each year and the pipeline takes several years to get through, so real problems take a few years to filter through the pipeline and be felt. The 2014 change materially shifted applicant quality on net. While it is technically and tautologically true that everyone who makes it through training is qualified, the “qualified” bar on the AT-SAT eliminated very few candidates, with quality maintained mostly by the “well qualified” bar. Higher scores were genuinely predictive of better performance, and 2014 shifted applicant population. Not only that, it shattered the pipeline the FAA had built with CTI schools, making the process towards becoming an air traffic controller less certain, undercutting many of the most passionate people working to train prospective controllers, and leading to a tense and unclear relationship between the FAA and feeder organizations. Did anyone truly unqualified make it all the way through the pipeline? There's no reason to think so. Did average candidate quality decrease? There's every reason to think so. Would that lead to staffing issues? Unambiguously yes.New York TimesAs I write this story, we are in a moment of intense partisan divide, with everyone mad and very few terribly inclined to give grace or look for nuance. In part because of that, I don’t think this story can be treated as complete without making the undercurrent of its interaction with political partisanship clear and speaking directly to those sympathetic to one side or the other.I dislike Trump as much as anyone. Maybe I’m not supposed to play my hand like that while reporting a news article, but it’s true. I’ve wanted him out of politics since he entered the scene a decade ago, I voted against him three elections in a row, and I think he’s had a uniquely destructive effect within US politics. So I understand—please believe, I understand—just how disquieting it is to watch him stand up and blame DEI after a major tragedy. a thoroughly reported article on air traffic controller shortagesThe class members have mixed sentiments as things stand. Some are thrilled that what they see as the scourge of destructive DEI initiatives is finally being addressed. Others are liberals who are frustrated and hurt that something they worked so hard to keep nonpartisan, a real scandal that hurt them, can now be little but a partisan wedge, and they’re not happy with the way Trump is handling it.Trump isn’t handling the scandal how I would, but when is that not true? I expect collateral damage, I expect intense partisanship and noise, I expect chaos. But at the core, fundamentally, I can’t be unhappy that after a decade, a President finally brought attention to the scandal. I realize political expediency makes talking about the scandal a losing battle for Democrats now that the Biden admin declined to fix it, but a lot of the class members were badly hoping it could be resolved in a nuanced bipartisan way. It's a partisan cudgel right now because the FAA elected to sweep it under the rug for three administrations in a row rather than frankly and honestly cutting out the rot.Fundamentally, people should not be forced to choose between “burn it all down” and “sweep it under the rug.” People should not be forced to choose between lowering the bar and rejecting all outreach to struggling communities. Given the recent election, Democrats have years to build a vision of diversity that involves providing more opportunities for everyone to reach a high bar, not lowering the bar—one that involves making institutions work, not obfuscating institutional failure until it can no longer be hidden. The time is right for this, and not only can it happen, it should happen. The right way to draw a contrast with Trump is not denying that there was ever an issue, but showing that people who fundamentally believe in the value of institutions and in extending opportunity to a diverse citizenship understand the issues and are prepared to solve them better than bomb-throwers ever could. Finally, to conservatives: Drink my lib tearsSteve SailerAll of that is true. But please, as you’re handling this—as you’re digging up the corruption, understanding the failure, rooting through the mess—remember that without principled, brave, honest people like Moranda Reilly, all of this might have stayed hidden forever. It all could have died in obscurity. Remember that at root, this really is a bipartisan issue, and many of the class members really do believe in the value of diversity programs that provide a wider range of people opportunity to meet a high bar. I know Democrats had a chance to clean it up, and they didn’t, and now you’re going to do things your way. I get that. But please remember the people at the root, and remember that it took a whole lot more than just conservatives to fight this. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>[UPDATE] A Dangerous Assignment: Uncovering Corruption in Maduro’s Venezuela (full documentary)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWnZF6zpbPY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MWnZF6zpbPY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Feb 2025 03:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch an updated version of FRONTLINE and Armando.info’s 2024 documentary on a corruption scandal spanning from Venezuela to the U.S., and what has happened to the journalists who helped uncover the story.

Schaller discusses how the Red Hat team plans to integrate AI with IBM's open-source Granite engine to enhance developer tools, such as IDEs, and create an AI-powered Code Assistant. He says the team is also working on streamlining AI acceleration in Toolbx and ensuring Fedora users have access to tools like RamaLama. From the post: One big item on our list for the year is looking at ways Fedora Workstation can make use of artificial intelligence. Thanks to IBMs Granite effort we know have an AI engine that is available under proper open source licensing terms and which can be extended for many different usecases. Also the IBM Granite team has an aggressive plan for releasing updated versions of Granite, incorporating new features of special interest to developers, like making Granite a great engine to power IDEs and similar tools. We been brainstorming various ideas in the team for how we can make use of AI to provide improved or new features to users of GNOME and Fedora Workstation. This includes making sure Fedora Workstation users have access to great tools like RamaLama, that we make sure setting up accelerated AI inside Toolbx is simple, that we offer a good Code Assistant based on Granite and that we come up with other cool integration points. "I'm still not sure how I feel about this approach," writes designer/developer and blogger, Bradley Taunt. "While IBM Granite is an open source model, I still don't enjoy so much artificial 'intelligence' creeping into core OS development. This also isn't something optional on the end-users side, like a desktop feature or package. This sounds like it's going to be built directly into the core system."
 
"Red Hat has been pushing hard towards AI and my main concern is having this influence other operating system dev teams. Luckily things seems AI-free in BSD land. For now, at least."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Expert Engineers Meta’s Video Recommendations</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-expert-meta-video-recommendations</link><author>Willie D.

I spent my weekly allowance to play VF and VF2 in arcades, cavorted cross-country in search of rare Virtua Fighter 3 cabinets, and eventually connected with overseas friends by playing VF4 Evolution and Final Tuned in Japan. So when I see a new--or new-ish, in this case--Virtua Fighter game get released, I want it to be the best it can possibly be. Not just for myself, but so others can pick it up and understand why we longtime Virtua Fighter players adore these games so much.Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown--released a few years back on PS4--was a solid attempt at this, bringing the much-loved VF5 Final Showdown to PS4 with a fresh coat of paint. However, it fumbled in some key areas--particularly the netcode, which was a bizarre delay-based system in an era when fighting game developers were quickly and vocally embracing superior rollback systems. Now, with a new Virtua Fighter in active development and people talking about the series again, Sega has given us Virtua Fighter 5 REVO: another revision exclusively for PCs with the much-longed-for and player-demanded rollback netcode.The rollback netcode is clearly the major selling point here, as much of the game is still built upon the foundation of VF5 Ultimate Showdown: The menu graphics, interface, and character models are largely the same, with a bit of extra polish and visual flair if you've got solid graphics hardware. But that's fine--those areas didn't need much improvement, so why fix what isn't broken?Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Play with real quantum physics in your browser</title><link>https://quantum.orgsoft.org/</link><author>mattvr</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:24:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Accidental Socialists</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZnxHjhtODw</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/aZnxHjhtODw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:07:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Discussing the Frontier of Particle Physics with Brian Cox</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urFIHf5coxE</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/urFIHf5coxE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 18:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/startalk to stay fully informed on the latest Space and Science news.

How much more physics is out there to be discovered? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with physicist, professor, and rockstar Brian Cox, to discuss everything from the Higgs boson, life beyond our planet, and the fundamental forces that guide our universe.

We dive into the cutting-edge world of particle physics. Brian explains the incredible discoveries made at CERN, including the Higgs boson, and why smashing protons together at nearly the speed of light unlocks the building blocks of the universe. What mysteries remain in the standard model of physics? Brian unpacks the search for supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and dark matter while highlighting the challenges of exploring particles that only exist fleetingly after high-energy collisions.

The conversation then shifts to the grand cosmic scale. Brian and Neil explore the relationship between particle physics and astrophysics. Could gravity be a particle? What do these nearly massless particles tell us about the universe’s deeper truths? And how might the future of experiments like the Large Hadron Collider reshape our understanding of reality?

To wrap up, Brian shares his passion for public science communication and the philosophical questions that drive his work. Learn about his global live tour, Horizons, which combines stunning visuals, classical music, and a celebration of the universe’s vastness. Discover the excitement behind upcoming missions like the Europa Clipper and how moons like Europa and Io may hold the keys to extraterrestrial life.

With a mix of rock and roll energy, groundbreaking physics, and profound philosophical questions, this episode takes you on a journey through the smallest particles to the largest structures in the cosmos—and everything in between.

After living in the United States for six decades, he returned to Germany in 2012. Ever since then, he’s been working to educate people.

Unlike many adults, younger people aren’t as reserved when meeting the Holocaust survivor. They ask him all sorts of questions and take selfies with him - including the concentration camp tattoo on his arm.

Weinberg was born in the East Frisia region of northern Germany in 1925. Adolf Hitler taking power in 1933 changed the trajectory of his family life forever. Like other Jewish families, the Weinberg’s were victims of persecution, exploitation, and murder. Albrecht's parents, Alfred and Flora, were killed in Auschwitz. Albrecht himself survived and emigrated to the United States.

He finally returned to Germany 13 years ago. Since then he’s been trying to reconcile himself with the country of his birth. At his side is his former nurse, Gerda Dänekas - the two are now roommates and best friends. For years, Albrecht and Gerda have been working to raise awareness about the Holocaust and ensure its remembrance. They visit schools and memorial sites, give speeches, and talk to the media. Recent developments, such as antisemitic incidents in Germany and the rise of right-wing extremists, have motivated the pair to maintain their fight against hatred and antisemitism for as long as possible.

This film shows the two friends going about their work, as well as their everyday life together. Even though 99-year-old Albrecht Weinberg no longer has the energy he used to, Gerda is committed to sharing his story, as well as that of other Holocaust victims.

That’s good—computers need precision. But it also forces humans to think like machines.For decades we tried to fix this by making programming more human-friendly. Higher-level languages. Visual interfaces. Each step helped, but we were still translating human thoughts into computer instructions.AI was supposed to change everything. Finally, plain English could be a programming language—one everyone already knows. No syntax. No rules. Just say what you want.The first wave of AI coding tools squandered this opportunity. They make flashy demos but produce garbage software. People call them “great for prototyping,” which means “don’t use this for anything real.”Many blame the AI models, saying we just need them to get smarter. This is wrong. Yes, better AI will make better guesses about what you mean. But when you’re building serious software, you don’t want guesses—even smart ones. You want to know exactly what you’re building.Current AI tools pretend writing software is like having a conversation. It’s not. It’s like writing laws. You’re using English, but you’re defining terms, establishing rules, and managing complex interactions between everything you’ve said.Try writing a tax code in chat messages. You can’t. Even simple tax codes are too complex to keep in your head. That’s why we use documents—they let us organize complexity, reference specific points, and track changes systematically. Chat reduces you to memory and hope.This is the core problem. You can’t build real software without being precise about what you want. Every successful programming tool in history reflects this truth. AI briefly fooled us into thinking we could just chat our way to working software.We can’t. You don’t program by chatting. You program by writing documents.When your intent is in a document instead of scattered across a chat log, English becomes a real programming language:You can see your whole system at onceYou can clarify and improve your intentYou can track changes properlyTeams can work on the system togetherRequirements become their own quality checksChanges start from clear specificationsThe first company to get this will own the next phase of AI development tools. They’ll build tools for real software instead of toys. They’ll make everything available today look like primitive experiments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why you feel stuck — and how to get motivated - Shannon Odell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD3-DKkiVeA</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kD3-DKkiVeA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Feb 2025 16:01:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dig into the psychology of how to overcome your motivational obstacles and regain focus when you feel stuck in achieving your goals.

--

Many of us have experienced feeling stuck. People often report feeling highly motivated at the start and end of a project, but the middle can feel untethered. It can happen when tackling something as simple as a term paper or as monumental as social inequality or the climate crisis. So, are there ways to get unstuck? Shannon Odell digs into the psychology of overcoming your motivational obstacles.

The ‘McKinley Tariffs’ were some of the largest hikes in U.S. history, but in his second term, McKinley changed his mind, and argued for more free international trade as a way of helping the U.S. economy.

WSJ explores how McKinley used tariffs, how Trump is following a similar playbook and why McKinley. Actually came to speak out against them.

From managing dynamic permissions to implementing fine-grained access controls, the challenges grow as your requirements and users scale.This eBook will guide you through the 6 key requirements all authorization layers should include to avoid technical debt:Architectural and design considerations for building a scalable and secure authorization layer.20+ technologies, approaches, and standards to consider for your permission management systems.Practical insights, based on 500+ interviews with engineers, architects, and IAM professionals.Learn how to create an authorization solution that evolves with your business needs, while avoiding technical debt.How to Scale MicroservicesThey wanted to reduce the maintenance effort and scale microservices quickly.So they relied on automation.A microservice must be scaled to handle changing traffic.Yet scaling manually is slow and causes errors.So they use infrastructure as code to keep things simple; it’s used to deploy new instances based on demand.  means managing and provisioning infrastructure using code.Ready for the next technique?It’s difficult to understand and maintain APIs without a proper naming convention.Yet maintaining consistent naming for APIs across microservices is hard. So they generate APIs using code and store API definitions as JSON in a separate Git repository.Here are the benefits of code-generated APIs:API paths can be validated using linters.API naming conventions and request-response structures are standardized.API version changes can be tracked through tagging.It ensures API operations are defined.User-friendly API paths can be set up as default.Also it standardizes APIs built using different programming languages. Put simply, code generation makes it look like a single person wrote APIs across the system.Besides code generation ensures health checks are included in each microservice.A health check URL is included in the API specification of the microservice.An unhealthy service is removed from production to avoid service interruptions.A change to database schema shouldn’t break microservices depending on it. Yet sharing a single database across microservices introduces tight coupling and failure risk.So they set up separate databases for each microservice.But maintaining many databases is a huge effort; so, they create databases and tables using code.Here are its main benefits:Consistent database names.Ensure proper database indexes exist from the start.Easy to maintain and operate the database.Besides a microservice shouldn't talk to a database owned by another microservice. Instead, communication happens only via the microservice’s API owning the database. Otherwise, the data changes aren't safe as they bypass business logic.: use code generation and automation to scale microservices quickly. It reduces maintenance efforts and helps with version control.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.I launched the newsletter deep dives last month.Yet future deep dives, starting this month, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price.“This newsletter is an amazing resource for learning system design.” AlexSubscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 123,001+ readers strong, very close to 124k.

1. This megacity was built on top of a former lake. The soil has become more and more compacted over time.  

2. The city’s main water supply is underground – and it’s being overused. 

3. Mexico City’s located in one of the world’s most active earthquakes zones. As the water supply dries up, the ground becomes less stable. 

More than 22 million people live in Mexico City, and the aging water infrastructure just can’t keep up. To compensate, water is brought in from other states. That may offer some relief to the city, but it ultimately ends up leaving those other areas dry.

ABSTRACT
Why is it so easy to screw up platform engineering, and how do you undo the damage?

Platform engineering… it’s the trendy new buzzword. For a thing we’ve been doing for years, ever since someone said “what if we re-did Solaris zones, but called it Docker instead?” It means building an internal engineering platform for your digital services or data pipelines. It allows you to scale teams up and down, and supercharge their abilities to deliver outcomes.

But here’s a thing that nobody likes to talk about. It’s easy to totally screw up platform engineering. When that happens, there’s a huge negative impact on your engineering culture, and your teams aren’t able to achieve their goals. So how do you avoid screwing up platform engineering, and if it does happen to you, can you actually fix it?

I’ve spent years in platform leadership roles, building internal engineering platforms at different scaleups and enterprise organizations. I’ve had successes, and I’ve had failures. I’ll cover the following irreversible ways to screw up, and how to start reversing out of them:

• Power tools - teams spend all their time configuring Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio etc., because the platform is based on overpowered tech
• Technology anarchy - N teams do the same task in N different ways, because the platform has no opinions on tech choices, ways of working, or path to prod
• Teams as tickets - making teams interact with the platform via tickets

And I’ll explain why all of these can be traced back to a scaling problem, the granddaddy screw up of platform engineering - your mindset is platform as a project, not as a product.

Takeaways
• Platform engineering is about creating an enabler of business value, so your teams can move faster and safer than ever before
• Avoid using platform engineering power tools e.g. Kafka, Kubernetes, Istio. If you’re using them, start measuring unplanned work and plan to migrate away
• Avoid being unopinionated on tech stack, ways of working, and path to prod. If you’re doing that, capture your leadership team’s expectations and track team commitments
• Avoid only interacting with teams through a ticketing system. If you’re stuck there, start collaborating with teams on self-service paved roads
• The key to platform engineering success is a platform as a product mindset [...]

Both services have largely depended on free server resources provided by Equinix (formerly Packet.net) and its Metal division for the past few years. Equinix announced recently that it was sunsetting its bare-metal sales and services, or renting out physically distinct single computers rather than virtualized and shared hardware. As reported by the Phoronix blog, both free software organizations have until the end of April to find and fund new hosting, with some fairly demanding bandwidth and development needs.
 
An issue ticket on Freedesktop.org's GitLab repository provides the story and the nitty-gritty needs of that project. Both the X.org foundation (home of the 40-year-old window system) and Freedesktop.org (a shared base of specifications and technology for free software desktops, including Wayland and many more) used Equinix's donated space.

A customer places an order, and your system needs to deduct the item from inventory, charge the customer’s credit card, and record the sale in your accounting system—all at once. What happens if the payment fails but your inventory count has already been reduced? Or if your application crashes halfway through the process?This is where  come into play. They ensure that all the steps in such critical operations happen reliably and consistently.ACID is an acronym that refers to the set of 4 key properties that define a transaction: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and In this article, we’ll dive into what each of the ACID properties mean, why they are important, and how they are implemented in databases.A  in the context of databases is a sequence of one or more operations (such as inserting, updating, or deleting records) that the database treats as . It either fully succeeds or fully fails, with no in-between states.When you send money to a friend, two things happen:Money is deducted from your account.Money is added to their account.These two steps form . If either step fails, both are canceled.Without transactions, databases could end up in inconsistent states. : Your money is deducted, but your friend never receives it.: Two people booking the last movie ticket at the same time.Transactions solve these problems by enforcing rules like  (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).Now, lets looks at each of the ACID properties.Atomicity ensures that a transaction—comprising multiple operations—executes as a unit of work: it either  succeeds (commits) or  fails (rolls back). If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to a state exactly as it was before the transaction began.In a money transfer transaction, if the credit step fails, the debit step cannot be allowed to stand on its own. This prevents inconsistent states like “money disappearing” from one account without showing up in another.Atomicity abstracts away the complexity of manually undoing changes if something goes wrong.How Databases Implement AtomicityDatabases use two key mechanisms to guarantee atomicity.1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logs)Every operation is recorded in a  before it’s applied to the actual database table.If a failure occurs, the database uses this log to  incomplete changes.Once the WAL entry is safely on disk, the database proceeds with modifying the in-memory pages that contain rows for  and .When the operations succeed:The database marks  as  in the transaction log.The newly updated balances for A and B will eventually get flushed from memory to their respective data files on disk.If the database crashes  the log entry is written but  the data files are fully updated, the WAL provides a way to recover:On restart, the database checks the WAL.It sees  was committed.It reapplies the  operations to ensure the final balances are correct in the data files.If the transaction had not committed (or was marked as “in progress”) at the time of the crash, the database would  those changes using information in the log, leaving the table as if the transaction never happened.2. Commit/Rollback ProtocolsDatabases provide commands like , , and Any changes made between  and  are considered “in-progress” and won’t be permanently applied unless the transaction commits successfully.If any step fails, or if you explicitly issue a , all changes since the start of the transaction are undone. in the context of ACID transactions ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another valid state—never leaving it in a broken or “invalid” state.It means that all the data integrity constraints, such as  (no duplicate IDs),  (related records must exist in parent tables), and (age can’t be negative), are satisfied before and after the transaction.If a transaction tries to violate these rules, it will not be committed, and the database will revert to its previous state.You have two tables in an e-commerce database: (with columns: , , etc.) (with columns: , , , etc.): You can’t place an order for a product if  is greater than the  in the  table.If the product’s  was 8 (less than what we’re trying to order), the database sees that the new value would be  which breaks the consistency rule (it should not go negative).The transaction fails or triggers a rollback, preventing the database from ending in an invalid state.How to Implement ConsistencyDatabase Schema Constraints, , , ,  constraints, and other schema definitions ensure no invalid entries are allowed.Triggers and Stored ProceduresTriggers can automatically check additional rules whenever rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.Stored procedures can contain logic to validate data before committing.Application-Level SafeguardsWhile the database enforces constraints at a lower level, applications often add extra checks—like ensuring business rules are followed or data is validated before it even reaches the database layer. ensures that concurrently running transactions do not interfere with each other’s intermediate states.Essentially, while a transaction is in progress, its updates (or intermediate data) remain invisible to other ongoing transactions—giving the illusion that each transaction is running sequentially, one at a time.Without isolation, two or more transactions could read and write partial or uncommitted data from each other, causing incorrect or inconsistent results.With isolation, developers can reason more reliably about how data changes will appear to other transactions.To understand how isolation works, it helps to see what can go wrong without proper isolation.  Common concurrency anomalies include:Transaction A reads data that Transaction B has modified but not yet committed.If Transaction B then rolls back, Transaction A ends up holding an invalid or “dirty” value that never truly existed in the committed state.Transaction A reads the same row(s) multiple times during its execution but sees different data because another transaction updated or deleted those rows in between A’s reads.Transaction A performs a query that returns a set of rows. Another transaction inserts, updates, or deletes rows that match A’s query conditions.If A re-runs the same query, it sees a different set of rows (“phantoms”).Databases typically allow you to choose an , which balances data correctness with performance.Higher isolation levels provide stronger data consistency but can reduce system performance by increasing the wait times for transactions. Let's explore the four common isolation levels:Allows dirty reads; transactions can see uncommitted changes.Rarely used, as it can lead to severe anomalies.A transaction sees only data that has been committed at the moment of reading.Prevents dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur.Ensures if you read the same rows multiple times within a transaction, you’ll get the same values (unless you explicitly modify them).Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads, but phantom reads may still happen (depending on the database engine).The highest level of isolation, acting as if all transactions happen sequentially one at a time.Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.Most expensive in terms of performance and concurrency because it can require more locking or more conflict checks.How Databases Enforce IsolationPessimistic Concurrency ControlRows or tables are locked so that no other transaction can read or write them until the lock is released.Can lead to blocking or deadlocks if multiple transactions compete for the same locks.2. MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)Optimistic Concurrency ControlInstead of blocking reads, the database keeps multiple versions of a row.Readers see a consistent snapshot of data (like a point-in-time view), while writers create a new version of the row when updating.This approach reduces lock contention but requires carefully managing row versions and cleanup (vacuuming in PostgreSQL, for example).A form of MVCC where each transaction sees data as it was at the start (or a consistent point) of the transaction.Prevents non-repeatable reads and dirty reads. Phantom reads may still occur unless the isolation level is fully serializable. ensures that once a transaction has been committed, the changes it made will survive, even in the face of power failures, crashes, or other catastrophic events. In other words, once a transaction says “done,” the data is permanently recorded and cannot simply disappear.How Databases Ensure Durability1. Transaction Logs (Write-Ahead Logging)Most relational databases rely on a  to preserve changes before they’re written to the main data files:: The intended operations (updates, inserts, deletes) are recorded in the WAL on durable storage (disk).: Once the WAL entry is safely persisted, the database can mark the transaction as committed.Apply Changes to Main Data Files: The updated data eventually gets written to the main files—possibly first in memory, then flushed to disk.If the database crashes, it uses the WAL during :: Any committed transactions not yet reflected in the main files are reapplied.: Any incomplete (uncommitted) transactions are rolled back to keep the database consistent.2. Replication / RedundancyIn addition to WAL, many systems use replication to ensure data remains durable even if hardware or an entire data center fails.: Writes are immediately copied to multiple nodes or data centers. A transaction is marked committed only if the primary and at least one replica confirm it’s safely stored.: Changes eventually sync to other nodes, but there is a (small) window where data loss can occur if the primary fails before the replica is updated.Regular  provide a safety net beyond logs and replication. In case of severe corruption, human error, or catastrophic failure:: Capture the entire database at a point in time.Incremental/Differential Backups: Store changes since the last backup for faster, more frequent backups.: Ensures backups remain safe from localized disasters, allowing you to restore data even if hardware is damaged.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Congress, dominated by the ruling party, approved last Wednesday a confusing reform to the Bitcoin Law at the request of Bukele’s government, which had no other option to receive the $1.4 billion credit agreed in December with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).The reform eliminated the word “currency” when referring to bitcoin, but says it is “legal tender.” Despite the lack of clarity, it lifts, as required by the IMF, the obligation to accept it in transactions or debt payments, a key condition for it to be “legal tender,” according to economic analysts. With the change, “if someone owes you money and wants to pay you in bitcoin, you can refuse to be paid in bitcoin, but you cannot refuse if it’s legal tender,” economist Carlos Acevedo explained.The use of bitcoin in El Salvador’s dollarized economy, according to the new rule, will be optional and will be at the discretion of the private sector to accept cryptocurrency payments for goods and services. Businesses are no longer required to convert dollar prices into this cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin no longer has that force of legal tender. That’s how it should have always remained, but the government wanted to force it and it didn’t work,” economist Rafael Lemus said.The Bitcoin Law reform will take effect 90 days after it’s published in the Official Gazette, which could happen in the coming days. For Acevedo, former president of the former Central Bank, “it makes no sense” to have left in the reformed law that it is “legal tender.” “It’s a monstrosity that’s not understood and that should be corrected and made clear that bitcoin is no longer legal tender,” the economist argues.But even being so, Salvadorans, with the exception of a few, never embraced Bukele’s initiative, who enjoys enormous popularity for his war against gangs, which dropped homicides to historic lows in El Salvador. A recent survey by the Central American University (UCA) revealed that 92% of Salvadorans did not use bitcoin in their transactions in 2024.“I used it and didn’t like it… Very complicated and risky. This is not for an employee who barely gets by on their salary,” Juana Henríquez, a 55-year-old nurse, said, saying she had tried to make some profit and instead lost money. Bukele also failed to achieve his project, which he announced with fireworks, to create Bitcoin City, a high-tech city that would be the capital of bitcoiners in the country and would take energy for mining from a volcano in Conchagua, about 200 km from Salvador.Berlin, a city 110 km east of San Salvador, and El Zonte beach (southwest) are two areas that concentrate bitcoiners, but many are foreign residents or tourists.Bitcoin’s biggest promoter in the country, Bukele, has not yet referred to the legal reform. But officials ensure that the government will continue betting on this cryptocurrency, whose price currently exceeds $100,000. El Salvador’s ambassador to the United States, Milena Mayorga, told journalists Thursday, during a bitcoin event in San Salvador, that the law reforms should be seen as an adaptation “to the circumstances.”The government, she assured, will continue buying bitcoin and having reserves in this cryptocurrency. According to the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has 6,050 bitcoins worth $634.8 million. “President Bukele continues buying bitcoin, we have a Bitcoin Office, we have the Bitcoin Law, bitcoin can be used in El Salvador. It hasn’t been an easy road,” Mayorga summarized.For Lemus, because “the government has its bitcoin reserve and will buy more” it is necessary “to have transparency, for citizens to know how public funds are being invested.” Bukele recently said he is convinced that with Donald Trump – whom he supports – in the White House there will be “an exponential revaluation” of the cryptocurrency. He frequently posts price increases on his social networks. For now, he remains silent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Maybe don&apos;t get that close to a Plesiosaurus</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFHjhxLNt-o</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bFHjhxLNt-o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 23:25:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

The Verge's Lauren Feiner reports: NetChoice has become one of the fiercest -- and most successful -- opponents of age verification, moderation, and design code laws, all of which would put new obligations on tech platforms and change how users experience the internet. [...] NetChoice's latest suit opposes the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, a rule that echoes a California law of a similar name. In the California litigation, NetChoice notched a partial win in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the district court's decision to block a part of the law requiring platforms to file reports about their services' impact on kids. (It sent another part of the law back to the lower court for further review.)
 
A similar provision in Maryland's law is at the center of NetChoice's complaint. The group says that Maryland's reporting requirement lets regulators subjectively determine the "best interests of children," inviting "discriminatory enforcement." The reporting requirement on tech companies essentially mandates them "to disparage their services and opine on far-ranging and ill-defined harms that could purportedly arise from their services' 'design' and use of information," NetChoice alleges. NetChoice points out that both California and Maryland have passed separate online privacy laws, which NetChoice Litigation Center director Chris Marchese says shows that "lawmakers know how to write laws to protect online privacy when what they want to do is protect online privacy."
 
Supporters of the Maryland law say legislators learned from California's challenges and "optimized" their law to avoid questions about speech, according to Tech Policy Press. In a blog analyzing Maryland's approach, Future of Privacy Forum points out that the state made some significant changes from California's version -- such as avoiding an "express obligationâ to determine users' ages and defining the "best interests of children." The NetChoice challenge will test how well those changes can hold up to First Amendment scrutiny. NetChoice has consistently maintained that even well-intentioned attempts to protect kids online are likely to backfire. Though the Maryland law does not explicitly require the use of specific age verification tools, Marchese says it essentially leaves tech platforms with a no-win decision: collect more data on users to determine their ages and create varied user experiences or cater to the lowest common denominator and self-censor lawful content that might be considered inappropriate for its youngest users. And similar to its arguments in other cases, Marchese worries that collecting more data to identify users as minors could create a "honey pot" of kids' information, creating a different problem in attempting to solve another.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/130</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/130/changelog-news-130.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tim Sh tracked himself down through in-app ads, Sniffnet comfortably monitors your Internet traffic, Cate Huston opines on what makes a good team, Victor Shepelev draws on 25 years of coding to share seven things he now knows & Grant Slatton tells you how to write a good design document.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

In 2013, incarcerated individuals in California’s Pelican Bay Prison assembled a historic hunger strike to protest decades-long sentences of solitary confinement. The defiance united over 30,000 inmates from diverse backgrounds in a powerful display of solidarity. This act garnered national attention and shed light on the inhumane conditions of The SHU (Security Housing Units). “The Strike” highlights the strength of prisoner-led resistance and the transformative power of collective organizing.

I've been there twice, and both times been involved in messy brawls despite not tasting a lick of alcohol. The second of these fisticuffs was against a small group of Cuman deserters. They seemed nice enough, but I was still wary considering the Cumans are who killed my parents a few months back. I wasn't the only one, and after failing to ease the growing tension, I decided to side with the local townspeople when push came to shove.Needless to say, we didn't put up much of a fight. Once the Cumans left, one of the locals implored me to track them down and deal with them once and for all. After eventually tracking them down, the sole Czech-speaking Cuman was so welcoming that I ended up getting drunk with them. I got so inebriated, in fact, that my night revolved around almost drowning, playing matchmaker for one of the soldiers, and then having a conversation with a talking dog that definitely wasn't real. This night of revelry would've been fine on any other evening, but I promised two new acquaintances that I'd be up bright and early to join them on a critical mission. Even after sleeping for seven hours, I was still completely plastered when I arose from my stupor. And let me tell you, fighting bandits with blurred vision, a swaying body, and a soundtrack of frequent farting isn't ideal.To some, this last part might sound utterly infuriating. To me, and others like me, this is part of what makes Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 utterly enticing. This is a game that sings when you're swept up in an entertaining series of events ignited by the consequences of your actions; where the game's quest design and emphasis on player choice wonderfully intertwine with its systems-driven sandbox to create a wholly immersive experience. While its 2018 predecessor was often disrupted by technical issues--which were further exacerbated by a frustrating save system--and clunky combat, Kingdom Come 2 refines and improves upon it in every respect. The obtuse nature of some of its RPG systems still won't click for everybody, but this is a confident sequel that builds on the foundations established by the original game, presenting a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I convert videos to printed flipbooks for living</title><link>https://www.videotoflip.com/</link><author>momciloo</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 15:09:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Contact us to discuss your bulk order needs and receive a customized quote.

Taken on its own, each campaign remains a superbly engaging escapade across eras that will keep you playing for "one more turn" until you realize you're late for your sister's birthday party. Civilization VII is not just a game that you play to pass the time during weekends--the experience is compelling enough that it  the weekend, and maybe several weekdays of your life, too.For Civilization VII, Firaxis has made some sweeping changes, most notably with how you progress through each historical period. Several of these new features are welcome, given that they address concerns from previous titles while also making campaigns more dynamic. However, a few design decisions are bound to be contentious, especially for longtime fans, since these mechanics tend to impact the player's control over certain outcomes.One of the biggest changes in Civilization VII is how you choose leaders and nations separately. Gone are the days when picking Augustus Caesar or Napoleon meant automatically playing as Rome or France, respectively. Instead, leaders have a unique trait that defines their playstyle, and you can select a country independently to complement that playstyle.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>These Graphene Tattoos Are Actually Biosensors</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/graphene-biosensor</link><author>Dmitry Kireev</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjExODgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MjQwMjY5OH0.vgPw2A84lmrK8A6WYJlp0gOXgP4vD-uMUbKsNGgIQFE/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Flexible stick-on patches could monitor blood pressure, stress, and more ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Klarity – Open-source tool to analyze uncertainty/entropy in LLM output</title><link>https://github.com/klara-research/klarity</link><author>mrciffa</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 13:53:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We've open-sourced Klarity - a tool for analyzing uncertainty and decision-making in LLM token generation.

It effortlessly enables us to write simple text and have it transform to rich media.
It feels that it has all the right features without in-your-way bells and whistles.This is the editor I wanted to have since forever 🙌Today, we are proud to present to you Marksmith. The GitHub-style markdown editor for Ruby on Rails. It supports ActiveStorage and has a few powerhouse features like preview-panel and helper, toolbar, and list-continuation.Seamless markdown editingI feel that the best way to write markdown is in plain-text. I've used those "markdown wysiwyg" editors like EasyMDE but they just don't feel natural. I think in text, so I want to write text. Let me just write it like that.That's why Marksmith's interface is a plain  where you write plain text. No distractions or any fancy post processing. Once I finish writing the markdown I usually click the preview button to see what it would look like and if the body is valid. Marksmith has a built-in preview pane which will render the markdown as HTML.Marksmith comes with a  helper which will render that content on your show page or other places with the same HTML that you see in your Preview pane.This renderer is easily customizable and extendable in your own app.ActiveStorage integrationOne of the things I do in editors is to embed media and more often images. Marksmith comes integrated with Rails' amazing ActiveStorage framework for storing files.Drag-and-drop files or click the dedicated button to attach files. Images will automatically be formatted as a markdown image and other files will be attached as a link.One nice thing I love about GitHub's editor is the list continuation feature. When writing lists, after I click return, I expect that the editor will go on the next line and add a new list item. 🙌 Marksmith does that!One request we get very often is the ability to inject images that have previously been uploaded by users, thus not duplicating that content.
Marksmith seamlessly integrates with Avo and will feature an "Add from gallery" button to enable that.I'd like to thank Jeremy Smith for pointing me toward GitHub's toolbar element and other packages and for providing the code for the ActiveStorage integration ❤️Marksmith is available on GitHub as an MIT gem. It's an engine that hooks up in any Rails app quickly and integrates beautifully with Avo.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Allies had a HUGE problem in the Atlantic</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTJWNLg9E_E</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/XTJWNLg9E_E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 12:00:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#ww2 #history #battleoftheatlantic #iwm #uboat]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Story: One Million Checkboxes - The Viral Game That Defied Convention</title><link>https://corecursive.com/one-million-checkboxes-with-nolen-royalty/</link><author>Adam@corecursive.com (Adam@corecursive.com)</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/corecursive/omcb.mp3?dest-id=628353" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://corecursive.com/">Podcast - CoRecursive</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if internet trolls could become your greatest collaborators?

In this first episode, we learn how subtle religious and political differences upset the balance of power in England, and plunged the kingdom into chaos.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Max Carrey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DeepSeek, China, OpenAI, NVIDIA, xAI, TSMC, Stargate, and AI Megaclusters | Lex Fridman Podcast #459</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1f-o0nqpEI</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_1f-o0nqpEI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 00:12:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dylan Patel is the founder of SemiAnalysis, a research & analysis company specializing in semiconductors, GPUs, CPUs, and AI hardware.

But long-time Slashdot reader theodp complains it's a "gushing how-to-make-Agile-even-better opinion piece."

Like other pieces by Agile advocates, it's long on accolades for Agile, but short on hard evidence justifying why exactly Agile project management "has emerged as a critical component for firms looking to improve project delivery speed and flexibility" and the use of Agile approaches is being expanded across other departments beyond software development. Indeed, among the three examples of success offered in the piece to "highlight the effectiveness of agile methods in navigating complex stakeholder dynamics and achieving project success" is Atlassian's use of agile practices to market and develop its products, many of which are coincidentally designed to support Agile practices and teams (including Jira). How meta. 

Citing "recent studies," the piece concludes its call for stakeholder engagement by noting that "59% of organizations measure Agile success by customer or user satisfaction." But that is one of those metrics that can create perverse incentives. Empirical studies of user satisfaction and engagement have been published since the 1970's, and sadly one of the cruel lessons learned from them is that the easiest path to having satisfied users is to avoid working on difficult problems.

Facebook's heavy-handed censorship of Linux groups and topics was "in error," the social media juggernaut has admitted. Responding to reports earlier this week, sparked by the curious censorship of the eminently wholesome DistroWatch, Facebook contacted PCMag to say that it had made a mistake and that the underlying issue had been rectified. 

"This enforcement was in error and has since been addressed. Discussions of Linux are allowed on our services," said a Meta rep to PCMag. That is the full extent of the statement reproduced by the source... Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has appealed against the Community Standards-triggered ban shortly after it noticed it was in effect (January 19). PCMag received the Facebook admission of error on January 28. The latest statement from DistroWatch, which now prefers posting on Mastodon, indicates that Facebook has lifted the DistroWatch links ban. 


More details from PCMag:

Meta didn't say what caused the crackdown in the first place. But the company has been revamping some of its content moderation and plans to replace its fact-checking methodology with a user-driven Community Notes, similar to X. "We're also going to change how we enforce our policies to reduce the kind of mistakes that account for the vast majority of the censorship on our platforms," the company said earlier this month, in another irony. 
"Up until now, we have been using automated systems to scan for all policy violations, but this has resulted in too many mistakes and too much content being censored that shouldn't have been," Meta added in the same post.

According to a copy of his résumé obtained by WIRED, he spent three months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, last summer.Both Bobba and Coristine are listed in internal OPM records reviewed by WIRED as “experts” at OPM, reporting directly to Amanda Scales, its new chief of staff. Scales previously worked on talent for xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, and as part of Uber’s talent acquisition team, per LinkedIn. Employees at GSA tell WIRED that Coristine has appeared on calls where workers were made to go over code they had written and justify their jobs. WIRED previously reported that Coristine was added to a call with GSA staff members using a nongovernment Gmail address. Employees were not given an explanation as to who he was or why he was on the calls.Kliger, whose LinkedIn lists him as a special adviser to the director of OPM and who is listed in internal records reviewed by WIRED as a special adviser to the director for information technology, attended UC Berkeley until 2020; most recently, according to his LinkedIn, he worked for the AI company Databricks. His Substack includes a post titled “The Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys Its Enemies,” as well as another titled “Pete Hegseth as Secretary of Defense: The Warrior Washington Fears.”Killian, also known as Cole Killian, has a working email associated with DOGE, where he is currently listed as a volunteer, according to internal records reviewed by WIRED. According to a copy of his now-deleted résumé obtained by WIRED, he attended McGill University through at least 2021 and graduated high school in 2019. An archived copy of his now-deleted personal website indicates that he worked as an engineer at Jump Trading, which specializes in algorithmic and high-frequency financial trades.Shaotran told Business Insider in September that he was a senior at Harvard studying computer science and also the founder of an OpenAI-backed startup, Energize AI. Shaotran was the runner-up in a hackathon held by xAI, Musk’s AI company. In the Business Insider article, Shaotran says he received a $100,000 grant from OpenAI to build his scheduling assistant, Spark.Are you a current or former employee with the Office of Personnel Management or another government agency impacted by Elon Musk?

The source, who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they fear retaliation, says they worry that the new teams could bypass the regular security clearance protocols to access the agency’s sensitive compartmented information facility, as the Trump administration has already granted temporary security clearances to unvetted people.This is in addition to Coristine and Bobba being listed as “experts” working at OPM. Bednar says that while staff can be loaned out between agencies for special projects or to work on issues that might cross agency lines, it’s not exactly common practice.“This is consistent with the pattern of a lot of tech executives who have taken certain roles of the administration,” says Bednar. “This raises concerns about regulatory capture and whether these individuals may have preferences that don’t serve the American public or the federal government.”Additional reporting by Zoë Schiffer and Tim Marchman.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Everyone knows your location: tracking myself down through in-app ads</title><link>https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/</link><author>apokryptein</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 17:07:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently I read about a massive geolocation data leak from Gravy Analytics, which exposed more than 2000 apps, both in AppStore and Google Play, that secretly collect geolocation data without user consent. Oftentimes, even without developers` knowledge. I looked into the list (link here) and found at least 3 apps I have installed on my iPhone. Take a look for yourself! This made me come up with an idea to track myself down externally, e.g. to buy my geolocation data leaked by some application. After more than couple dozen hours of trying, here are the main takeaways: I found a couple requests sent by my phone with + 5 requests that leak , which can be turned into geolocation using reverse DNS. Learned a lot about the RTB (real-time bidding) auctions and OpenRTB protocol and was shocked by the amount and types of data sent with the bids to ad exchanges. Gave up on the idea to buy my location data from a data broker or a tracking service, because I don't have a big enough company to take a trial or $10-50k to buy a huge database with the data of millions of people + me. Well maybe I do, but such expense seems a bit irrational. Turns out that EU-based peoples` data is almost the most expensive. But still, I know my location data was collected and I know where to buy it! My setup for this research included:My old iPhone 11 restored to factory defaults + new apple id. Felt too uncomfortable to do all this on my current phone. Charles Proxy to record all traffic coming in and out. I set up the SSL certificate on the iPhone to decrypt all https traffic.A simple game called Stack by KetchApp - I remember playing it at school 10-12 years ago. Choosing it as a lab rat felt nostalgic. To my surprise, there were a lot of KetchApp games on the list. Ok, here we go: only 1 app installed without the default Apple ones, Charles on, launching Stack in 3, 2, 1.... These are the requests that the app sends in the first minute after launch. Take a look at the timing of the requests - almost every split second. Let's take a look at the contents of the requests. I actually checked every single one of them - but I'll leave out only the interesting ones here. Let's start with the juiciest request sent to https://o.isx.unity3d.com - the first one that included my geo, while I disabled Location Services on iPhone for all apps! If you are as naive as I was before this, you might be surprised - what does Unity, the 3D engine, have to do with the in-app advertisement or location tracking? Perhaps that's just some monitoring data to help improve the engine? Turns out that Unity's main revenue stream (they made $2 bln+ in 2023) is Unity Ads - "Mobile Game Ad Network". Sounds quite interesting.Below is the request body in json format sent to Unity Ads. I will only leave the  fields worth mentioning - the actual size is 200+ keys. {
  "ts": "2025-01-18T23:27:39Z", // Timestamp
  "c": "ES", // Country code,
  "d": "sports.bwin.es", // Domain; the app or website where the ad will be displayed.
  "bn": "molocoads-eu-banner", // WTF is moloco ads? We'll see!
  "cip": "181.41.[redacted]", // my IP !!
  "dm": "iPhone12,1", 
  "ct": "2", // Connection type; e.g., Wi-Fi
  "car": "Yoigo", // mobile network operator
  "ifv": "6B00D8E5-E37B-4EA0-BB58-[redacted]", // ID for Vendor. We'll get back to it!
  "lon": "2.[redacted]", // Longitude ... 
  "lat": "41.[redacted]", // Latitude ... 
  "sip": "34.227.224.225", // Server IP (Amazon AWS in US) 
  "uc": "1", // User consent for tracking = True; OK what ?!
}Ok, so my IP + location + timestamp + some  id are shared with Unity → Moloco Ads → Bwin, and then I see the actual Bwin ad in the game. Wonderful! As a quick note - location shared was not very precise (but still in the same postal index), I guess due to the fact that iPhone was connected to WiFi and had no SIM installed. If it was LTE, I bet the lat/lon would be much more precise. Hello Facebook... What are you doing here?Next interesting request that leaks my IP + timestamp (= geo-datapoint) is Facebook.What?!I don't have any Meta [Facebook] app installed on this iPhoneI didn't link the app nor my Apple ID to any Facebook accountI didn't consent to Facebook getting my IP address!{ 
	"bundles": {
		"bidder_token_info": {
			"data": {
				"bt_extras": {
                  "ip":"181.41.[redacted], // nice Extras, bro
                  "ts":1737244649
			},
			"fingerprint": null
		},
        {
          "a lot of data: yes a loooooooot"
         }We'll talk more about this one in the next section. Why do you need my screen brightness level? {
  "osVersion":"16.7.1",
  "connectionType":"wifi",
  "eventTimeStamp":1737244651,
  "vendorIdentifier":"6B00D8E5-E37B-[redacted]", // ifv once again 
  "wiredHeadset":false, // excuse me? 
  "volume":0.5,
  "cpuCount":6,
  "systemBootTime":1737215978,
  "batteryStatus":3,
  "screenBrightness":0.34999999403953552,
  "freeMemory":507888,
  "totalMemory":3550640, // is this RAM?
  "timeZone":"+0100",
  "deviceFreeSpace":112945148
  "networkOperator":"6553565535"
  "advertisingTrackingId":"00000000-0000....", // interesting ...
  }There's no "personal information" here, but honestly this amount of data shared with an arbitrary list of 3rd parties is scary. Why do they need to know my screen brightness, memory amount, current volume and if I'm wearing headphones? I know the "right" answer - to help companies target their audience better! For example, if you're promoting a mobile app that is 1 GB of size, and the user only has 500 MB of space left - don't show him the ad, right?But I also heard lots of controversies on this topic. Like Uber dynamically adjusting taxi price based on your battery level - because you're not waiting for a cheaper option with 4% left while standing in the street. I can't know if that or another one is true. But the fact that this data is available and accessible by advertisers suggests that they should at least think of using it. Ok, enough with the requests. We can already see the examples of different ip and geolocation leaks.  + timestamp was adjust.com - but the request body was too boring to include. You might've already noticed  and  ==  in the requests above - what are those? IFV, or IDFV, is "ID for Vendor". This is my id unique for each vendor, a.k.a developer - in this case, KetchApp. This checks out: I installed another KetchApp game to quickly record the requests, and the  value was the same for it. Advertising Tracking ID, on the other hand, is the cross-vendor value, the one that is shared with an app if you choose "Allow app to track your activity across ...". As you can see above, it was actually set to  because I "Asked app not to track". I checked this by manually disabling and enabling tracking option for the Stack app and comparing requests in both cases. And that's the only difference between allowing and disallowing trackingI understand there might be nothing shocking to you in it - this is not really kept secret, you can go and check the docs for Apple developers, for example. But I believe this is  communicated correctly to the end users, you and me, in any adequate way, shape or form: the free apps you install and use collect your precise location with timestamp and send it to some 3rd-party companies. The only thing that stops anyone with access to bid data (yet another ad buying agent, or ad exchange, or a dataset bought or rented from data broker, as you'll see later) from tracking you down with all trips you make daily is this  that is not shared when you disallow apps to "track you across apps" to "enhance and personalise your ads experience". By the way: if you're using 10 apps from the same vendor (Playrix, KetchApp or another 1000-app company) and allow  to track you – it would mean that the data collected in all 10 apps will be enriched with your IDFA which can later be exchanged to your personal data. At the same time, there is so much data in the requests that I'd expect ad exchanges to find some loophole ID that would allow cross-app tracking without the need for IDFA. I found at least 20 ids like  and ,  and  (these 2 are shared with Facebook), and so on. By the way, the fact that Facebook collected my IP + timestamp without any adequate consent / app connection from my end is crazy. I think Facebook is more than capable of connecting the dots and my Meta Account to this hit as soon as I login to Instagram or Facebook app on the same IP address. Let's get back to the request that leaked my location for a second and look at its trace. We'll focus on the parties in the middle:stack →  o.isx.unity3d.com → molocoads → bwin (advertiser)Unity [ads] is an SSP (supply-side platform) that acts as a collector of data from the app via SDK. As an app developer, you don't need to worry about gathering the right data, registering as a publisher on an ad exchange or whatever - just install the SDK and receive the money. Moloco ads is a DSP network that resells data from multiple SSPs (like Unity, Applovin, Chartboost). Basically, from almost every one of the requested hosts I've seen pop up in Charles Proxy.It then applies some "smart optimisation" and connects a vacant banner space on your phone screen with the advertiser.Sounds like moloco aggregates a lot of data and basically anyone (- any company that becomes an ad partner) can access the data by bidding lower than others. Or imagine a real ad exchange that bids normally and collects all of the data along the way "as a side gig". Basically, this is how intelligence companies and data brokers get their data. At this point I was looking for any mentions of Moloco on Telegram and Reddit, and I ran into this post that answered a lot of my questions:They access it if they integrate with the provider of bidstream, which would be the SSP. It's on the SSP to verify the vendor to whom they give access to bids. Usually, the requirement would be that you actually... bid. SSPs want you to spend money, that's how their business makes revenue. They might open up only part of the traffic to specific vendors (i.e.. if you don't bid worldwide, you won't get the bidstream worldwide, only in the regions in which you operate).Let's move further. When I found out how the data gets out, I started looking for any place where it's being sold. It was a quick search.I found a data marketplace called Datarade which is a panel with all sorts of data. When I searched for MAID-specific data, hundreds of options showed up, like these two: The price of the Redmob dataset surprised me, - $120k a year... for what?Let's now take a look at their promo:Check out the list of features on the right - do any of them look familiar? : "low latency" means they know your location from the last time any of the apps shared it. It can be as little as 5 seconds ago. What's even better is that Redmob provides a  of the data. I tried to request it from their website, but the sample never landed in my mailbox (surprise-surprise, timsh.org doesn't seem like a customer with high potential). Thankfully, this sample is public on Databricks Marketplace with this annotation:Enhance your products and services using our global location data covering over 1.5 billion devices. Using our extensive location dataset, you can unearth concealed patterns, conduct rapid analyses, and obtain profound knowledge.We can also provide region-specific data (MENA, Africa, APAC, etc.) based on your specific requirements. Our pricing model includes an annual licensing option, and we provide free sample data so that you can evaluate the quality of our dataset for yourself. To me, the most absurd part is the  column - the source of the data can't be more obvious. I'm also quite interested in the  column - if it's the birthyear, where did they get it from? Never mind, who cares about your birthyear.All right, imagine I bought the access to a huge stream of Redmob data. But my goal is to track and stalk people like myself or anyone else, so I need some way to exchange MAIDs () for the actual personal info: name, address, phone number... No problem! This kind of dataset is surprisingly also present on Datarade. Take a look at a sample table with  type that is provided by "AGR Marketing Solutions":Inside - all personal info (full name, email, phone number, physical address, property ownership... and IDFAs. Congrats, you have just reached the bottom of this rabbit hole. Let's wrap it up and make a couple of bold statements.How to track yourself down?Easy! Just follow this simple step-by-step guide:Use some free apps for a bit. Move around and commute - this makes the geo data more valuable. "Allow" or "ask not to track" - a combo of IP + location + User-agent + geolocation will still be leaked to hundreds of "3rd parties" regardless of your choice.Wait for a few seconds until fake DSPs and data brokers receive your data.Exchange your full name or phone number for an IDFA (if present), IP address and user-agent through the  data purchased somewhere.Now, access the "Mobility data" consisting of geolocation history, and filter it using the values from the previous step. Congratulations! You found yourself. I created a flowchart that includes almost all actors and data mentioned above - now you can see how it's all connected. This is the worst thing about these data trades that happen constantly around the world - each small part of it is (or seems) legit. It's the bigger picture that makes them look ugly. Thanks for reading this story until the end!My research was heavily influenced by these posts and investigations: ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Technology Can Save The World | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODqJuV8v4y8</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ODqJuV8v4y8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 16:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This video is a compilation of clips filmed from 2022.

Animal welfare focuses on animals’ well-being, particularly of those under human care or ownership. Protection laws aim to ensure that animals’ physical, mental, and environmental needs are met, while allowing their owners to make use of them (for food or labor, for example) without inflicting any “unnecessary suffering.”   

Advocates of animal rights, on the other hand, believe animals should be legally protected from all forms of exploitation. Many proponents say people should not be allowed to farm animals, use them in laboratories, injure or kill them. 

Both views are based on the idea that most animals are sentient beings, which can think and feel and therefore have personal interests which should be respected.

- Run native macOS VMs in 1 command, using Apple Virtualization.Framework: `lume run macos-sequoia-vanilla:latest`- API server to manage VMs programmatically `POST /lume/vms`- A python SDK on github.com/trycua/pylumeRun prebuilt macOS images in just 1 step:
lume run macos-sequoia-vanilla:latestLocal API Server:
`lume` exposes a local HTTP API server that listens on `http://localhost:3000/lume`, enabling automated management of VMs.HN devs - would love raw feedback on the API design and whether this solves your Apple Silicon VM pain points. What would make you replace UTM/Multipass/Docker Desktop with this?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Modest – musical harmony library for Lua</title><link>https://github.com/esbudylin/modest</link><author>esbudylin</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 10:32:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a project I've been building in my spare time over the past few months. It's a library that provides methods for working with musical harmony ‒ intervals, notes, chords. For example, it can parse almost any chord symbol (Fmaj7, CminMaj9, etc) and turn it into notes, or it can identify a chord from a given set of notes.I started this project with the idea of using formal grammar to parse chord symbols. I wanted to use it instead of a hand-written parser, which is the common approach among similar libraries. Lua caught my attention because of Lpeg, a Parsing Expression Grammar library that is both fast and easy to use. An additional motivation for using Lua was the lack of comparable libraries for it, even though the language is commonly used in audio programming.However, despite being a Lua library, the project itself is written in Fennel — a "lispy" language that transpiles to Lua. Fennel has features that make writing code for the Lua platform much more pleasant: a concise syntax, macros, and destructuring — a feature Lua sorely lacks!In the process, I definitely learned a lot about music theory, although my new knowledge is quite one-sided. By working on this library, I know a thing or two about types and structure of chords, but I learned almost nothing about their composition and transformation. Perhaps these will be the directions I explore next in the project.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Keychron Q0 Max macropad review (Gateron Jupiter Banana)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj9cv_fpwDE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zj9cv_fpwDE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Feb 2025 10:19:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 3:39 for a typing demonstration.

"The teachers faded away pretty quickly," Gates adds, "But about six of us stayed hardcore. One was Paul Allen..." — the future co-founder of Microsoft. And the experience clearly meant a lot to Gates. "Microsoft just never would've happened without Paul — and this teletype room." 

In a longer post thanking his "brilliant" teachers, Gates calls his teletype experience "an encounter that would shape my entire future" and "opened up a whole new world for me." Gates also thanks World War II Navy pilot and Boeing engineer Bill Dougall, who "was instrumental in bringing computer access to our school, something he and other faculty members pushed for after taking a summer computer class... The fascinating thing about Mr. Dougall was that he didn't actually know much about programming; he exhausted his knowledge within a week. But he had the vision to know it was important and the trust to let us students figure it out." 

Gates shared a similar memory about the computer-room's 20-something overseer Fred Wright, who "intuitively understood that the best way to get students to learn was to let us explore on our own terms. There was no sign-up sheet, no locked door, no formal instruction."

Instead, Mr. Wright let us figure things out ourselves and trusted that, without his guidance, we'd have to get creative... Some of the other teachers argued for tighter regulations, worried about what we might be doing in there unsupervised. But even though Mr. Wright occasionally popped in to break up a squabble or listen as someone explained their latest program, for the most part he defended our autonomy... 
Mr. Wright gave us something invaluable: the space to discover our own potential.

On Monday, over a trillion dollars was wiped off the US stock market due to the appearance of a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

The release of a new reasoning model, known as R1, led investors to question US dominance in tech, their expectations around future AI capex while also raising the prospect that China might beat Silicon Valley at its own game.

The new DeepSeek model can “reason” to solve complex problems and performs as well as the AI software from US tech giants like Google and OpenAI, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.

DeepSeek quickly overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.

Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.

Back in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.
They also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. 
A nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.
For four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General’s Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

ABSTRACT
The software industry is changing faster than ever. Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.

In this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?

In short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?

They were all telling one another the same thing: Data on the website were about to disappear, or be altered, to comply with the Trump administration’s ongoing attempt to scrub federal agencies of any mention of gender, DEI, and accessibility. “I was up until 2 a.m.,” Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan who relies on the CDC’s data to track viral outbreaks, told me. She archived whatever she could.The full scope of the purge isn’t yet clear. One document obtained by  indicated that the government was, as of yesterday evening, intending to target and replace, at a minimum, several “suggested keywords”—including “pregnant people, transgender, binary, non-binary, gender, assigned at birth, binary [], non-binary [], cisgender, queer, gender identity, gender minority, anything with pronouns”—in CDC content. While these terms are often politicized, some represent demographic variables that researchers collect when tracking the ebb and flow of diseases and health conditions across populations. Should they be reworded, or even removed entirely, from data sets to comply with the executive order, researchers and health-care providers might have a much harder time figuring out how diseases affect specific communities—making it more challenging to serve Americans on the whole.CDC data’s “explicit purpose” is to guide researchers toward the places and people who most need attention, Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University and a former CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, told me. As the changes unfold before him, he said, “it’s hard to understand how this benefits health.”When I contacted the CDC, a spokesperson redirected my requests for comment to the Department of Health and Human Services. After this story was published, an HHS spokesperson said that “all changes to the HHS website and HHS division websites are in accordance with President Trump’s January 20 Executive Orders” on gender and DEI.The government appears to understand that these changes could have scientific implications: The document directing a review of CDC content suggests that some work could be altered without “changing the meaning or scientific integrity of the content,” and that any such changes should be considered “routine.” Changing other content, according to the document, would require review by an expert precisely because any alterations would risk scientific integrity. But the document does not specify how data would be sorted into those categories, or at whose discretion.“My fear is that in the short term, entire data sets would be taken down,” then reappear with demographic variables removed or altered to conform with DEI restrictions, Katie Biello, an epidemiologist at Brown, told me. Excising mention of gender and sexual orientation, for instance, from public-health data sets could require stripping entire columns of data out. If the government chooses to define sex as binary, transgender people and nonbinary people, among others, could be effectively erased. In response to the ongoing changes, some groups of researchers are now rushing to archive the CDC website in full.Acknowledging and addressing health differences among demographic groups is a basic epidemiological tenet, Biello told me, “so we know where to target our health interventions.” She pointed to examples in her own field: Gay men have higher rates of STIs, but lower rates of obesity; transgender women have higher rates of HIV, but lower rates of prostate cancer. More broadly, demographic changes to data sets could limit the country’s ability to identify which Americans are most at risk from an expansive list of conditions including adolescent depression, STIs, even sex-specific cancers. Changing data sets in this way would be tantamount to “erasing our ability to use data and evidence” to care for people, Rachel Hardeman, a health-equity expert at the University of Minnesota, told me.Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Brown, pointed to mpox as a recent example of how replacing “gender” with “sex,” or ignoring sexual orientation, could limit effective public-health responses. At the beginning of the United States’ 2022 outbreak, neither researchers nor the public had much clarity on who was most affected, leading to widespread panic. “Officials were talking about the situation as if it was a risk we equally faced,” Nuzzo said. By collecting detailed demographic information, researchers were able to show that the disease was primarily affecting men who have sex with men, allowing officials to more efficiently allocate resources, including vaccines, and bring the epidemic under control before it affected Americans more widely.A scrub such as this could also change how the government allocates funds for long-standing threats to public health, which could widen health-equity gaps, or reverse progress in combatting them. Rates of STIs more generally have recently begun to plateau in the U.S., after decades of steady increase—but altering data that focus interventions on, say, transgender populations, or men who have sex with men, could undo those gains. If no data exist to prove that a health issue concentrates within a particular community, that “provides a justification to cut funding,” one researcher told me. (Several scientists who spoke with me for this article requested anonymity, for fear of retaliation for speaking out about the loss of federal data.) Sullivan, whose work focuses on HIV surveillance, compared the government’s actions to, effectively, destroying the road map to determining who in America most needs screening, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment.Much of the data on the CDC website have been aggregated from states, so it would be possible for researchers to reassemble those data sets, Nuzzo pointed out. But that’s an onerous task, and several scientists told me they never thought they’d be in a position where they’d have to scramble to squirrel away publicly available federal data. Nuzzo also worried that states might be reluctant in the future to share data with the federal government, or might decide not to bother collecting certain data at all. On the most basic scientific level, changing federal-government data means those data become unreliable. Public-health data are collected with the intention of sussing out which populations most need health interventions; altering those data leaves behind a skewed portrait of reality.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Android 16&apos;s Linux Terminal Runs Doom</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/31/2317212/android-16s-linux-terminal-runs-doom?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Feb 2025 01:40:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Google is enhancing Android 16's Linux Terminal app to support graphical Linux applications, so Android Authority decided to put it to the test by running Doom. From the report: The Terminal app first appeared in the Android 15 QPR2 beta as a developer option, and it still remains locked behind developer settings. Since its initial public release, Google pushed a few changes that fixed issues with the installation process and added a settings menu to resize the disk, forward ports, and backup the installation. However, the biggest changes the company has been working on, which include adding hardware acceleration support and a full graphical environment, have not been pushed to any public releases.
 
Thankfully, since Google is working on this feature in the open, it's possible to simply compile a build of AOSP with these changes added in. This gives us the opportunity to trial upcoming features of the Android Linux Terminal app before a public release. To demonstrate, we fired up the Linux Terminal on a Pixel 9 Pro, tapped a new button on the top right to enter the Display activity, and then ran the 'weston' command to open up a graphical environment. (Weston is a reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, a modern display server protocol.)
 
We also went ahead and enabled hardware acceleration beforehand as well as installed Chocolate Doom, a source port of Doom, to see if it would run. Doom did run, as you can see below. It ran well, which is no surprise considering Doom can run on literal potatoes. There wasn't any audio because an audio server isn't available yet, but audio support is something that Google is still working on.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why This D.C.

It turns out that if you include any expletives in your search query, Google will not return an AI Overview, as they are called, at the top of the results page.For instance, if you search “How large is the student body of Yale University?” the search results page will return a large AI-generated blurb above the blue links. If you instead search, “How large is the fucking student body at Yale University?” you will instead get a standard list of blue link results, sans-AI summary.This is not the first time internet sleuths have discovered a way to disable Google’s AI-powered results. Other methods are more complicated, however, like adding a specific string of characters to the search results page URL. This method of swearing and pleading at Google to “just give me the fucking links” is much more cathartic.We are going to go out on a limb here and say that if people are regularly finding techniques to disable AI summaries in Google searches, perhaps that means they do not want them in the first place? Google search results have never been perfect, of course—there is still a lot of poor information across the web. But AI summaries present users with a prominent blurb at the top of their search that looks authoritative when it just risks compounding the misinformation problem with more erroneous slop.It is the same way Siri has been made worse by its integration with ChatGPT. At least in the past, when the voice assistant did not know how to answer a question it would just throw users to the web. Now Siri offers up ChatGPT-generated responses instead, sometimes spitting out incorrect nonsense instead of admitting it is not sure. But this is all being forced on users whether they like it or not. From Google Docs to X and Instagram, there are AI buttons and search boxes and dropdowns everywhere now, because every tech company needs to have an AI strategy. Is a basic keyword search too much to ask?When Google first introduced AI Overviews into search, it went viral for returning nonsensical responses, such as suggesting that one can prevent cheese from sliding off their pizzas by using glue or improve gut health by eating pebbles. It is believed Google’s model sourced the information from Reddit comments. AI does not know how to identify sarcasm or satire. earlier reported on the new loophole, which, if we are speculating, is caused by Google’s overly cautious steering of its AI model. Whereas a bot like xAI’s Grok is more than happy to swear and discuss sensitive topics, Google’s Gemini keeps it PG. Google has likely trained Gemini to avoid repeating expletives, so it simply is disabled in search when a curse word is present in order to avoid that.Google has argued that AI Overviews, as they are called, do not reduce traffic sent to websites because users will view summaries and be interested in delving deeper into the source material after finding something of interest. That logic has not comforted media companies, which have been litigating the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity for ingesting their content into large language models.We imagine Google will close the expletive loophole eventually, but in the meantime, if you are sick of AI, you now know an easy way to avoid it. Just tell Google to give you the fucking links.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Over the top auth strategies (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/78</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/78/changelog--friends-78.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan Moore from FusionAuth joins us for a wide-ranging discussion about modern auth strategies.

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.

This is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. 

Because shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?

The story of Chrissy Teigen’s paternal great-grandparents was largely unknown to her. Research determines that she is descended from multiple generations of musicians, and from the Sinti people, a subgroup of the Romani people. The Roma, or Romani people were often denigrated as Gypsies, but it explains why Teigen’s ancestors moved so often.

Chrissy Teigen is a New York Times #1 bestselling author, TV personality and the founder of food and lifestyle brand Cravings. In 2016, Teigen released “Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat” which debuted #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and marked the first time a cookbook debuted #1 on USA Today's best-seller list. Teigen cohosted and executive produced “Chrissy & Dave Dine Out” with David Chang. She also executive produced and starred in “Chrissy’s Court”, executive produced the HBO Max documentary series “The Way Down”, and starred opposite Tina Fey and Nat Faxon in the Netflix animated comedy series “Mulligan”.

Synchronicity makes an extraordinary claim about reality—events may be linked in diverse and strange ways that defy all physical law, causality and common sense. What would it mean if events may relate to each other only by some kind of meaning, however obscure, not by some kind of physical interaction? This type of extraordinary claim demands extraordinary evidence.

ABSTRACT
Playwright is the hottest browser automation tool on the market. You can use it for testing and web scraping, but also for production monitoring!

In this talk I’ll explain the basics of Playwright, show real life (code) examples and explain how to use browser automation for effective, high signal to noise production monitoring: I like to call this the “monitoring as code” workflow. After this talk, you will have the basic knowledge on using Playwright in your own dev pipeline and catch errors on production. [...]

Höss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about Höss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can see the History Hit film about the house here:You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'.

According to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.

It's a world I wanted to dive into from the jump, if only to uncover more of how it came to be and what the cultures of the different locations are like. And as much as the worldbuilding retains that wonder with incredible-looking environments that make for engaging play spaces for the physics-based magic system, the beat-for-beat details of Eternal Strands' story aren't nearly as rewarding to unravel.Eternal Strands' story too often hits on familiar fantasy tropes, such as an inexplicable magical disaster that changed everything and a corrupting force that seemingly has no weakness and must be avoided at all costs. But the history that story is built on adds a semblance of life to the world, building memorable NPCs that you want to come back to again and again to talk about what in their life led them to where they are now, and painting a somber undertone to the world that begs to be uncovered through its detailed lore notes and optional collectibles.I especially love how Eternal Strands packages aspects of its history so they're viewed through the art of weaving--not a typical choice for action-adventure games. Concepts like spells are recontextualized, transforming from arcane runes into fashion choices. You can largely avoid the historical exposition if you'd rather spend your time swinging a sword and spewing fire, but there's some great writing to uncover here for lore hounds.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Were Neandertals morning people?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSchvm7lLOw</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vSchvm7lLOw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

This film’s protagonists are united by the challenges, suffering and constant change they face - as well as by their confidence that things will turn out well in the end.

When Lend Mustafa loses his mother, he plunges into a deep crisis. She was his most important support as he embarked on a difficult journey: Lend had decided to live not as a woman, but as a trans man. Not an easy decision in the patriarchal Kosovar society in which Lend lives. But Lend stays true to his decision and goes on to open a club in Kosovo for the queer community. 
Ekaterina Straijewa is also familiar with the challenges of living in a patriarchal society. In Bulgaria, she was a successful racing driver. Despite her success, she faced ridicule for being a woman on the racetrack. Then an assault forced her to give up her profession. Her whole life was thrown into question. But she manages to fight her way back and climbs into the cockpit once again. 
Bashkim Lilo grew up in the Albanian mountains and worked as a shepherd. When he was offered the opportunity to train as a nursing assistant, he jumped at the chance. Because it was clear to him that this was the only way he and his family would have a future in Albania.

The exodus reflects growing frustration with Oracle's shift to per-employee pricing for its Java platform, which critics called "predatory" and could increase costs up to five times for the same software, Gartner found. The dissatisfaction runs deepest in Europe, where 92% of French and 95% of German users want to switch to alternative providers like Bellsoft Liberica, IBM Semeru, or Azul Platform Core.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to survive the apocalypse | Ada, Ep. 1</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3RlT7qzAUE</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/d3RlT7qzAUE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:01:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Ada’s first day of her new job at the library, she imagines a post-apocalyptic future.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn sits down with esteemed philosophy Richard Swinburne to discuss how the problem of evil may provide a strong argument against theism, the theory of the Trinity, animals in evolution, and more.

Richard Granville Swinburne FBA is an English philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of "The Coherence of Theism", "The Existence of God", and "Faith and Reason". He has been influential in reviving substance dualism as an option in philosophy of mind.

We provide an examination of SDcpp, its components, and the technical concepts that enable efficient inference of Stable Diffusion models on lower-end hardware such as CPUs and lightweight GPUs, such as Apple M-series chips. In particular, we’re looking at Flux.1, a text-to-image model developed by Black Forest Labs.Introduction to Diffusion Models and Stable DiffusionDiffusion models, specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), have emerged as powerful generative frameworks capable of producing high-fidelity images from random noise through iterative denoising processes. Stable Diffusion extends the DDPM framework by incorporating text conditioning, allowing for the generation of images based on descriptive prompts. However, the computational demands of such models typically necessitate high-memory, high-bandwidth GPU resources, limiting their accessibility and scalability.SDcpp addresses these limitations by providing an optimized inference framework that leverages techniques such as quantization, memory-efficient sampling, and optimized latent space representations to facilitate the deployment of Stable Diffusion models on devices with constrained computational resources. This paper delves into the architectural and algorithmic components of SDcpp, highlighting the methodologies that underpin its efficiency and performance.The architecture is composed of several interdependent modules, each contributing to the inference process. First, it is loading the required models (1), including text encoders, the diffusion model, and the VAE decoder. It then performs  (2), tokenizing the input prompt and generating text embeddings using a CLIP-based model and an additional T5XXL text conditioning model. Next, it computes the conditioning graph (3), transforming embeddings to create a guidance vector for the diffusion process. The system then  (4) by iteratively refining a randomly initialized latent tensor using a noise schedule and a chosen sampling method, progressively steering it towards a structured latent representation in a number of . This step is the most compute-intensive, consuming roughly 90% of the total processing time. Once sampling completes, the pipeline decodes the latent representation (5) using a VAE model to reconstruct pixel-space information. Finally, it  (6) as an image file, completing the text-to-image generation process.Diffusion Model Core ComponentsThe diffusion model within SDcpp is the principal generative engine, responsible for transforming Gaussian noise into coherent images through a series of denoising . More steps allow finer details and smoother outputs but increase inference time, as each step requires additional computation. This process is governed by the DDPM framework, wherein the model iteratively refines the image by removing noise in a controlled manner. The diffusion model encompasses three primary components:UNet (Denoising Network): the UNet architecture employs an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, enabling multi-scale feature extraction and reconstruction. The network predicts and removes noise at each denoising step, progressively enhancing image quality.Text Encoder (Conditioning Module): The text encoder converts textual prompts into latent embeddings that guide the denoising process. SDcpp supports multiple text encoders, including CLIP-L, CLIP-G, and T5XXL, each tailored for different model versions and memory considerations.Scheduler (Noise Controller): The scheduler orchestrates the noise removal strategy, dictating the temporal progression of denoising steps. It determines the rate and manner in which noise is reduced, balancing computational efficiency and image fidelity.A recent model,  , is optimized for low-resource environments, featuring a compact UNet architecture that accelerates inference by reducing the number of denoising steps. Flux.1 is designed for memory-efficient quantization and compatibility with the GGUF format, making it suitable for deployment on lightweight hardware. It reduces inference steps to only 4 steps and can achieve fast inference.Variational Autoencoder (VAE)VAEs facilitating the encoding of images into a lower-dimensional latent space. This reduction significantly diminishes computational and memory overhead while retaining high-resolution image details. Latent space is a compact mathematical representation of an image. Think of it as a highly efficient shorthand where only the most essential details are stored. Instead of storing every pixel, the image is encoded as numbers that describe its features. This makes it possible to work with images at a much lower computational cost. Stable Diffusion doesn’t generate images pixel by pixel. Instead, it creates images in latent space, where information is stored in a more compact and manageable way. Once the model finishes generating an image in this space, the VAE  it back into a high-resolution format that we can see.Different VAEs can influence how well the final image looks. A generic VAE works for most images, but a model trained for a specific style, like anime or realistic photography, may use a custom VAE to better match its training data. A poorly matched VAE can cause color shifts, blurriness, or unwanted artifacts.Technically, any model can use any VAE, but results vary. A VAE trained on cartoon-style images won’t reconstruct a photorealistic image correctly. This is why some models provide their own VAEs — they have been optimized to maintain details that matter most for a specific style.LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)LoRA facilitates model customization without the need to adjust the entire diffusion model. By modifying only a small subset of parameters (~10 million), LoRA significantly reduces memory usage compared to full model fine-tuning. Multiple LoRAs can be combined with weighted influences on the final image, enabling diverse stylistic and feature modifications. For instance, combining two LoRAs with different weights can be executed using the syntax <lora:styleA:0.6> <lora:styleB:0.8>. To optimize performance, it is advisable to minimize the number and strength of LoRAs, especially in memory-limited environments.Training and Inference File FormatsThe  is the standard PyTorch checkpoint format, that stores full precision weights and optimizer states. Supports training and fine-tuning but can execute arbitrary Python code, posing security risks. SafeTensors (.safetensors) is a safer alternative to CKPT, with structured, immutable storage and no executable code. Loads faster but still used mainly for training.GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) is a binary model format introduced by llama.cpp, succeeding GGML. Initially designed for language models (like LLaMA models), GGUF has been adopted in diffusion models to enable efficient, quantized inference without reformatting model files into proprietary formats (e.g., .ggml or .gguf conversions required previously). Traditional formats (.safetensors, .ckpt, .bin) store full-precision FP16/FP32 model weights, consuming significant VRAM. GGUF introduces quantization at multiple levels, storing models in 2-bit to 16-bit precision while maintaining compatibility with SDcpp.Use GGUF for efficient inference on low-resource devices, prefer .safetensors for training.In our experiments,  demonstrates an extremely fast denoising process, with images at 1 and 2 steps appearing nearly identical, suggesting that most structural information is determined in the very first iterations. By 4 steps, images diverge significantly, and by 6 steps, they change even more, indicating that additional steps introduce large variations rather than just refining details. Interestingly, Euler and Euler_a produce the best results, likely because they follow a balanced noise reduction trajectory, allowing structure to form naturally without over-smoothing or excessive deviations. Euler introduces noticeable changes between 3, 4, and 6 steps, including shifts in pose, face, and hair color, implying that it follows a latent space trajectory where small step changes can drastically impact the final result. Euler_a, being an ancestral sampler, adds controlled randomness at each step, further amplifying these changes. In contrast, LCM performs poorly with Flux 1, excessively blurring images, likely due to its tuning for models that require more iterative refinement, making it unsuitable for Flux 1’s fast-converging architecture. We observed that 4 steps often produce better images than 5 or 6 steps, as extra iterations introduce unnecessary alterations instead of improving details, reinforcing that Flux 1 is optimized for extremely low-step inference. This is a stark contrast to Stable Diffusion models like SD 1.5 or SDXL, which typically require 20–50 steps for high-quality outputs. These findings highlight that Flux 1’s unique training favors fewer steps with the right sampler, making Euler and Euler_a better choices at around 4 steps, while models like LCM fail due to excessive denoising.Denoising Schedules and Sampling IntegrationDenoising schedules define a series of noise levels that guide reverse diffusion. These schedules set discrete or continuous noise decay steps, essentially parameterizing the stochastic differential equation used to reverse the diffusion process. Discrete schedules apply abrupt noise transitions, forcing the model to rapidly shift between latent states. In contrast, smooth schedules such as karras or exponential distribute noise reduction evenly, supporting more accurate latent updates.Sampling methods numerically integrate these latent trajectories. Euler-type samplers update the latent state with fixed time step approximations, benefiting from stable transitions when paired with smooth noise decay. Latent Consistency Models (LCM) depend on gradual noise reduction; abrupt schedules can induce over-smoothing and detail loss. Our observations indicate that matching a sampling method’s sensitivity to noise decay with an appropriate denoising schedule is key to preserving image structure while ensuring efficient inference.Flux.1’s behavior indicates that its training regime emphasizes rapid structure formation in early steps. Euler’s robustness across discrete, exponential, and karras schedules suggests that its integration of abrupt noise transitions still aligns well with Flux.1’s latent dynamics. LCM, being more sensitive to the noise decay, only works well with smoother schedules (exponential and karras) that provide gradual latent updates.The failures with AYS and GITS imply that these schedules impose noise trajectories incompatible with Flux.1’s fast-convergence design. Their latent paths likely diverge from the model’s learned reverse diffusion trajectory, causing the state to collapse into uniform or noisy outputs rather than structured images. This sensitivity reinforces that Flux.1 is optimized for few-step denoising with specific noise decay characteristics, and departures from that — especially with schedules that enforce alternative trajectory regularity — can disrupt the image generation process.Flux.1 departs from prior diffusion models by leveraging a T5-style text encoder instead of CLIP, allowing it to process full sentences fluently rather than relying on discrete token hierarchies. Unlike Stable Diffusion, where Booru-style tags and keyword emphasis are required for precision, Flux.1 understands natural language natively, reducing reliance on rigid token structures. Long, descriptive prompts yield better scene coherence, material accuracy, and relational awareness than fragmented keyword lists.Trigger words are optional rather than mandatory, as the model activates concepts contextually rather than requiring explicit token matching. However, structured elements — short modifiers or category cues — can refine specificity without overpowering Flux.1’s broader language comprehension. The model is particularly strong at multi-concept blending, which traditionally caused token interference in CLIP-based architectures. Negative prompting is also more effective, reducing the unintended blending of attributes.Flux.1 performs best with contextual and relational descriptions, leveraging semantic depth over isolated tokens. While Booru tags still function, hybrid prompting — mixing structured elements with full sentences — offers the best balance between control and generative adaptability.LoRA functions differently in Flux.1 compared to Stable Diffusion. Since Flux.1 uses a T5-based encoder, LoRA activation does not require fixed trigger words but instead responds dynamically to natural descriptions. This allows LoRAs to integrate seamlessly into prompts without rigid dependencies.Key parameters such as network dimension, alpha scaling, and captioning density influence performance. Higher network dimension strengthens adaptation but risks overfitting, while alpha scaling balances LoRA integration with the base model. Flux.1’s LoRAs benefit from mixed captioning strategies — varying between short tags and natural descriptions — ensuring activation without over-constraining the generative process. Unlike SDXL, which often requires explicit weight scaling (1.2–1.5x) to activate LoRAs, Flux.1 adapts LoRA strength more organically within context, reducing the need for manual weight adjustments.To maximize LoRA performance in Flux.1, descriptive phrasing should replace rigid token triggers, using context-driven prompts to activate learned modifications naturally. Captions should balance specificity with generalization, ensuring LoRAs enhance rather than dominate the generative output.Optimization Strategies for Low-Resource InferenceQuantization is a pivotal technique in reducing model size and memory usage by lowering the precision of model weights. SDcpp supports various quantization levels, each offering a different balance between memory efficiency and image quality: Reduces memory usage by approximately 75% compared to full precision (FP16) while maintaining good image quality. It introduces a slight computational overhead due to dequantization but is optimal for low-end hardware. Offers slightly better precision than Q4 at the cost of requiring twice the memory. It is suitable for systems with more VRAM where higher image fidelity is desired.For lower-end hardware, Q4_K provides a good balance of speed and quality, while  is better for systems with more VRAM (>16GB).Quantization Impact of Model PartsWe’re loading a model, vae, clip, and t5, and can choose quantized parts for each. The model itself must be quantized due to memory constraints, but the VAE, CLIP, and T5 can remain in higher precision. We tested a q4_K model with safetensors in higher precision, and a fully quantized version where all parts were q4_0.We observed a 2.5x slowdown with the fully quantized run, despite reduced memory usage. Likely due to increased dequantization overhead, precision mismatch-induced stalls, and reduced SIMD efficiency on the Apple M2. While background processes may have contributed to higher involuntary context switches (3.3M vs. 1.48M), they do not fully explain the slowdown. The quantization format (q4_K vs. q4_0) influences computational efficiency rather than raw inference speed, with q4_K employing grouped quantization, which improves data locality and reduces dequantization frequency, while q4_0 likely applies simpler per-tensor quantization, increasing compute overhead. The hybrid approach—quantizing only the diffusion model while keeping VAE, CLIP, and T5 in higher precision—seems to better utilize hardware by avoiding unnecessary precision conversion costs and leveraging FP computation optimizations. These results suggest that full quantization may degrade performance when not optimized for architectural strengths, particularly on FP-optimized hardware like the M2.The sampling method determines the strategy by which noise is removed during the denoising process. Ancestral samplers introduce random variations at each step, leading to more diverse outputs, while fixed-step samplers follow a deterministic trajectory, yielding consistent results.SDcpp integrates several sampling algorithms optimized for different performance criteria: A simple and fast method effective with a lower number of denoising steps, suitable for rapid inference. Prioritizes image quality, requiring more steps and memory. It is ideal for applications where high detail is essential.Latent Consistency Models (LCM): Optimizes speed by drastically reducing the number of required denoising steps (e.g., 4–8 instead of 20–30), making it highly suitable for low-end systems. Users can specify the sampling method using the --sampling-method flag, such as --sampling-method lcm.Memory management is critical in ensuring that diffusion models run efficiently on constrained hardware. SDcpp employs several techniques to optimize memory usage: By processing the VAE decoder in smaller, manageable segments, VAE tiling minimizes peak memory usage. Flash Attention optimizes memory allocation during UNet computations. On CUDA-enabled GPUs, it offers significant memory savings and speed improvements. Flash Attention can be activated via the --diffusion-fa flag.In our experiments on an Apple M2, enabling --vae-tiling reduced memory usage but increased execution time, suggesting a trade-off between efficiency and speed. When --diffusion-fa (Flash Attention) was enabled, execution time did not significantly improve. The combination of both options (vae-tiling and diffusion-fa) resulted in the  but also the , confirming that while these settings help on low-VRAM devices, they introduce performance overhead. The fastest run occurred with both options disabled, though it had the highest memory footprint.Image resolution directly impacts both memory consumption and inference speed. Generating images at a resolution of 1280×640 requires approximately 2.5 times the memory of generating images at 512×512. To accommodate low-resource environments, users can opt for intermediate resolutions such as 768×384 or 1024×512, balancing image quality and computational efficiency.LoRA Delay and Conditioning Graph RecalculationWhen LoRA modules are applied, the conditioning graph must be recalculated due to LoRA’s modification of internal activations, which can reintroduce dependencies on structured tagging if the LoRA was trained on datasets requiring them. The conditioner parses and reweights prompt segments dynamically, adjusting token influence based on LoRA-induced shifts in the embedding space, ensuring compatibility between the altered diffusion model state and the input text. This recalibration process accounts for the delay seen post-LoRA application and before sampling, as the system must harmonize LoRA-induced parameter shifts with Flux.1’s inherently context-aware text encoding.Classifier-Free Guidance ScaleCFG scale (Classifier-Free Guidance Scale) can be set with the --cfg-scale argument. It defaults to 7.0 and controls how strictly the model follows the text prompt, balancing adherence and creativity. Higher values (e.g., 10-15) force the model to generate images that closely match the prompt but can introduce artifacts, while lower values (e.g., 1-5) allow more randomness and artistic interpretation. It impacts performance slightly because higher CFG values increase the weight difference between conditional (prompted) and unconditional (random) predictions, requiring additional computation to balance them. However, the effect on inference speed is minor compared to factors like resolution, model architecture, and sampling steps.Flux.1 seem to have been trained with  as target setting, meaning its internal weighting and contrast are optimized for that value. Lowering CFG to  reduces guidance too much, allowing excessive noise influence, resulting in darker, underexposed images. Raising it to 2.0 strengthens prompt adherence but overemphasizes highlights and contrast, making images appear overly bright. Unlike standard Stable Diffusion, where 7.0 is the default for balanced outputs, Flux.1’s tuning makes , with deviations causing unintended brightness shifts.To analyze the impact of CFG scale on image generation, we generated eight images using CFG 1.0 and 2.0 across the Euler, LCM, iPNDM, and Euler_a samplers with 4 steps and a fixed seed of 42, using the prompt “a beautiful girl in futuristic Tokyo, neon lights,” comparing how different guidance levels influence brightness, contrast, and prompt adherence.Memory-Efficient InferenceRunning Flux.1 (schnell) on an Apple M2 (16GB RAM), we achieve inference without a GPU, completing a 256×256 image in 216.3s with 9.28GB RAM usage. The UNet required just 96.59MB, and VAE decoding used 416MB, demonstrating the efficiency of quantized GGUF models.Our analysis of Stable-Diffusion.cpp and Flux.1 demonstrates that efficient local diffusion inference is feasible even on low-resource hardware, provided that model selection, quantization, and sampling strategies are optimized. Flux.1’s extremely low-step denoising makes it uniquely suited for fast inference, especially when paired with Euler and Euler_a samplers, which balance structure formation and controlled randomness. In contrast, models like LCM introduce excessive smoothing, making them unsuitable for Flux.1’s fast convergence.We also observed that 4 steps yield optimal results with Flux.1, as additional iterations introduce unnecessary alterations rather than improving image fidelity. While our results indicate that full quantization introduces dequantization overhead and computational stalls, external factors such as background system load may have influenced the extent of the observed slowdown. Memory-efficient techniques such as VAE tiling and Flash Attention can reduce hardware requirements but may introduce performance trade-offs. Users should select Q4_K or similar quantization for lower-end hardware, as grouped quantization schemes appear to mitigate some of the performance penalties associated with fully quantized inference.These findings highlight that with the right model architecture, quantization, and sampler choice, high-quality image generation is possible on constrained devices without relying on high-end GPUs. Future improvements may focus on further refining model architectures like Flux.1 and optimizing quantization methods for even faster, memory-efficient inference.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The ups and downs of stratified cross-validation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpK9pWZGjbE</link><author>probabl</author><category>dev</category><category>ml</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EpK9pWZGjbE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:48:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIat2Cdg661wF5DQDWTQAmg">Dev - Probabl</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When you use GridSearchCV in scikit-learn will do a cross-validated hyperparameter search.

The concepts covered here are equally applicable to other large-scale video platforms such as  and .Before diving into the design, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements.Users should be able to  video files.Uploaded videos must be  into multiple resolutions (e.g., 240p, 360p, 720p, 1080p) to support different network conditions and devices.Users should be able to  videos in real-time with adaptive bitrate streaming to adjust quality based on network conditions.Users can  for videos by title, tags, or description.Users can  and  on videos.Users should be able to create and subscribe to .Non-Functional Requirements: The system should support millions of concurrent users and thousands of video uploads per minute. Core features like video upload, playback, and search should have minimal downtime. Fast video streaming with minimal buffering and near-instantaneous search results. Video files must be stored reliably, with redundancy mechanisms to prevent data loss due to hardware failures.

  development processes, developed by Beth Andres-Beck and hir father Kent Beck.
  It posits that two communities of software developers have great difficulty
  communicating to each other because they live in very different contexts, so
  advice that applies to one sounds like nonsense to the other.The desert is the common world of software development, where bugs are
  plentiful, skill isn't cultivated, and communications with users is difficult.
  The forest is the world of a well-run team that uses something like Extreme Programming, where developers swiftly put changes into
  production, protected by their tests, code is invested in to keep it healthy,
  and there is regular contact with The Customer.Clearly Beth and Kent prefer The Forest (as do I). But the metaphor is more
  about how description of The Forest and the advice for how to work there often
  sounds nonsensical to those whose only experience is The Desert. It reminds us
  that any lessons we draw about software development practice, or architectural
  patterns, are governed by the context that we experienced them. It is possible
  to change Desert into Forest, but it's difficult - often requiring people to do
  things that are both hard and counter-intuitive. (It seems sadly easier for
  The Forest to submit to desertification.) In this framing I'm definitely a Forest Dweller, and seek with Thoughtworks
  to cultivate a healthy forest for us and our clients. I work to explain The Forest to Desert
  Dwellers, and help my fellow Forest Dwellers to make their forest even more
  plentiful.Kent Beck supplied the image, which he may have painstakingly drew pixel by
    pixel.

Join historians, survivors and experts as they consider one of the great moral dilemmas of the 20th century. Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?

In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in Žilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler’s account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

German submarine, surface and air attacks were sinking merchant ships by the hundred. If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. 

In this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.

Most legal scholars say the meaning of the 14th Amendment is clear–that people born in the U.S. are citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. But the Trump administration’s legal case is built around the idea that children born to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be excluded from birthright citizenship.

Episode one of Great Migrations explores the first wave of the Great Migration (1910-1940), a collective leap into the unknown as more than a million Black Americans fled the Jim Crow South for the promised lands of the North. In the face of some of the country’s worst racist violence, these migrants established thriving Black neighborhoods, wielded political power, and redefined American culture.

1720 was a year of two bubbles and a plague.  The bubbles were the Mississippi Company in France –and the South Sea Bubble in England. In September 1720 - when the bubble burst, England was plunged into an economic and political crisis. This was one of the first examples of a financial boom and bust and was the event that gave rise to the use of the term bubble to describe a spectacular market failure.

This is something Rebellion seemed to figure out around the time of Sniper Elite 3 back in 2014, when the series ditched linear levels set in tight, wartorn streets in favor of a much deeper, wider tour of duty, with each map allowing for player choice in how they navigate the world and complete missions. The series has even gone so far as to create some absurd, Agent 47-like situations in which you can assassinate Nazis. Sniper Elite: Resistance reintroduces that tried-and-true formula for the fourth time in 11 years, and though it's still enjoyable, I can't help but notice how this campaign through the French countryside elicits such a strong sense of deja vu.Sniper Elite is a third-person shooter set during World War II, and like other games in the series, it can be played in first-person when you're aiming. The series has made a name for itself on a deep ballistic physics model that accounts for wind, bullet drop, and positioning, as well as its cherry on top: the X-ray killcam. This feature shows you, in slow-motion, how each bullet shreds Nazis in grotesque detail, inside and out. Like in other Sniper Elite games, a well-placed bullet can shoot their eyes out, explode their hearts, or even obliterate their testicles, among other special displays of sharpshooting.Like its predecessors, the game is a fun and reliable shooter when it comes to sniping mechanics, though I've grown weary of the killcam. These days, I more often skip the killcam, or at least adjust my settings to see fewer headhunting highlight reels. I get it by now; it's neat tech, but they add up over the course of a mission, which already tend to take me about two hours each, because I'm much more interested in stealthily completing my missions than watching the highlight reels of long-range vivisections.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple chips can be hacked to leak secrets from Gmail, iCloud, and more</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-M3-chip-series_screen-1152x648.jpeg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 20:56:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple-designed chips powering Macs, iPhones, and iPads contain two newly discovered vulnerabilities that leak credit card information, locations, and other sensitive data from the Chrome and Safari browsers as they visit sites such as iCloud Calendar, Google Maps, and Proton Mail.The vulnerabilities, affecting the CPUs in later generations of Apple A- and M-series chip sets, open them to side channel attacks, a class of exploit that infers secrets by measuring manifestations such as timing, sound, and power consumption.

Why was there more matter than antimatter left over? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice explore the quantum origins of the universe, charge parity violation, dark matter, and the many quarks that make up our world with CERN particle physicist Harry Cliff. 

We take a look at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and his work in studying b quarks (or “beauty quarks”) and sifting through mountains of data to identify new phenomena. We break down the 17 known fundamental particles—including six quarks, three electron-like particles, and three neutrinos. What particles are yet to be uncovered? Could that be the answer to dark matter?

As we dive into the early universe, we explore how matter and antimatter formed in nearly equal amounts, only for matter to triumph in a cosmic imbalance. What conditions created this asymmetry? We discuss CP violation and the other laws of nature that the universe may have broken to create itself. 

Harry also dives into the lifespan of particles, from the fleeting existence of most, to the surprising stability of protons and electrons. Learn how particle discoveries evolved, from Henri Becquerel’s observation of radioactivity to Karl Anderson’s discovery of antimatter in cosmic rays. We also explore how Einstein’s theory of relativity applies to particle accelerators, where particles moving near light speed experience time differently. Could these machines create a micro black hole? Harry explains why media fears of “destroying the universe” are unfounded and why the cosmos has been conducting such experiments for billions of years.

Finally, we tackle questions about dark matter, its presence in everyday life, and the hypothetical tachyons that could travel faster than light. Through it all, Harry sheds light on the quantum fields underpinning reality, revealing how particles are ripples in these invisible forces. With insights from his books, How to Make an Apple Pie from Scratch and Space Oddities, Harry guides us through the thrilling world of particle physics, showing how much we’ve learned—and how much more there is to discover.

ANIMATION CORRECTION:
At 4:52, the negative charge should be drawn on the carbon at the end of the chain, not on the second to last carbon. This also holds during the polymerization process (5:15), where the negative charge should move right to the end of the chain.

Two American Samoans share their opposing viewpoints: a traditional chief who wants to maintain the status quo and a U.S. Marine veteran who believes in the right to citizenship for his people. Both perspectives bring forward questions about American Samoans’ relationship to land, family, and identity.

--

As of 2022, humans have deforested 17% of the Amazon, and scientists warn that we may be approaching a tipping point. It’s like removing bricks from a house: take a few and the house remains standing; remove too many and the whole thing will collapse. So, what would happen if the entire Amazon disappeared? Anna Rothschild explores the relationship between this ecosystem and the rest of the planet.

But in many real-time systems, the server needs to talk first and more often.This is where  and  come into play—two popular methods for achieving real-time updates.In this article, we’ll explore these two techniques, how they work, their pros and cons, and use cases.HTTP, the backbone of the web, follows a :The client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request to the server.The server processes the request and sends back a response.This model is simple and works for many use-cases, but it has limitations: With plain HTTP, the server cannot proactively push data to the client. The client has to request the data periodically. HTTP is stateless, meaning each request stands alone with no persistent connection to the server. This can be problematic if you need continuous exchange of data.To build truly real-time features—live chat, financial tickers, or gaming updates—you need a mechanism where the server can instantly notify the client when something changes. is a technique that mimics real-time behavior by keeping HTTP requests open until the server has data.Long Polling is an enhancement over traditional polling. In regular polling, the client repeatedly sends requests at fixed intervals (e.g., every second) to check for updates. This can be wasteful if no new data exists. Long Polling tweaks this approach: the client asks the server for data and then “waits” until the server has something new to return or until a timeout occurs.How Does Long Polling Work? to the server, expecting new data.Server holds the request open until it has an update or a timeout is reached.If there's new data, the server immediately responds.If there’s no new data and the timeout is reached, the server responds with an empty or minimal message.Once the client receives a response—new data or a timeout—it immediately sends a new request to the server to keep the connection loop going.Simple to implement (uses standard HTTP).Supported universally since it uses standard HTTP, and it works reliably through firewalls and proxies.Higher latency after each update (client must re-establish connection).Resource-heavy on servers (many open hanging requests).Simple chat or comment systems where real-time but slightly delayed updates (near real-time) are acceptable.Notification systems for less frequent updates (e.g., Gmail’s "new email" alert).Legacy systems where WebSockets aren’t feasible.Code Example (JavaScript) provide a full-duplex, persistent connection between the client and the server.Once established, both parties can send data to each other at any time, without the overhead of repeated HTTP requests. Client sends an HTTP request with .: If supported, the server upgrades the connection to WebSocket (switching from  to ). After the handshake, client and server keep a TCP socket open for communication.Full-Duplex Communication: Once upgraded, data can be exchanged bidirectionally in real time until either side closes the connection.Ultra-low latency (no repeated handshakes).Lower overhead since there’s only one persistent connection rather than repeated HTTP requests.Scalable for real-time applications that need to support large number of concurrent users.More complex setup (requires the client and server to support WebSocket).Some proxies and firewalls may not allow WebSocket traffic.Complexity in implementation and handling reconnections/errors.Server resource usage might grow if you have a large number of concurrent connections.Live chat and collaboration tools (Slack, Google Docs, etc.).Multiplayer online games with real-time state synchronization.Live sports/financial dashboards that need to push frequent updates.Code Example (JavaScript)Both methods achieve real-time updates, but your choice depends on your project’s requirements: is easier to implement using standard libraries. Any environment that supports HTTP can handle it, often without extra packages. require a bit more setup and a capable proxy environment (e.g., support in Nginx or HAProxy). However, many frameworks (e.g., Socket.io) simplify the process significantly.Scalability and Performance can become resource-intensive with a large number of simultaneous clients, due to multiple open connections waiting on the server side. offer a more efficient, persistent connection and scale better for heavy, frequent data streams. fits scenarios where data updates aren’t super frequent. If new data arrives every few seconds or minutes, long polling might be enough. are better for high-frequency updates or two-way communication (e.g., multiple participants editing a document or interacting in a game). typically works even in older networks or those with strict firewalls. might face issues in certain corporate or older mobile environments, though this is less of a problem as the standard becomes more widespread.While both achieve real-time communication, WebSockets are generally more efficient for truly real-time applications, while Long Polling can be simpler to implement for less demanding scenarios.1. Server-Sent Events (SSE)Allows the server to push messages to the client over HTTP.It's simpler than WebSockets for one-way communication, but not full-duplex.Best suited for use cases like news feeds, real-time notifications, and status updates.Commonly used in IoT for lightweight publish-subscribe messaging.Specialized for device-to-device or device-to-server communication with minimal overhead.3. Libraries like Socket.ioProvides an abstraction over WebSockets for easier real-time communication.Automatically falls back to long polling if WebSockets are unsupported.Ensures cross-browser compatibility with robust and reliable performance.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

The project, intended to replace a 20-year-old SAP system with a SaaS-based HR and finance system, has faced multiple setbacks, renegotiated contracts, and a new systems integrator, with completion now pushed to December 2025. The Register reports: West Sussex County Council is taking advantage of the so-called "flexible use of capital receipts scheme" introduced in 2016 by the UK government to allow councils to use money from the sale of assets such as land, offices, and housing to fund projects that result in ongoing revenue savings. An example of the asset disposals that might contribute to the project -- set to see the council move off a 20-year-old SAP system -- comes from the sale of a former fire station in Horley, advertised for $3.1 million.
 
Meanwhile, the delays to the project, which began in November 2019, forced the council to renegotiate its terms with Oracle, at a cost of $3 million. The council had expected the new SaaS-based HR and finance system to go live in 2021, and signed a five-year license agreement until June 2025. The plans to go live were put back to 2023, and in the spring of 2024 delayed again until December 2025. According to council documents published this week [PDF], it has "approved the variation of the contract with Oracle Corporation UK Limited" to cover the period from June 2025 to June 2028 and an option to extend again to the period June 2028 to 2030. "The total value of the proposed variation is $2.96 million if the full term of the extension periods are taken," the council said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Facebook Flags Linux Topics As &apos;Cybersecurity Threats&apos;</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/27/2120230/facebook-flags-linux-topics-as-cybersecurity-threats?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Facebook has banned posts mentioning Linux-related topics, with the popular Linux news and discussion site, DistroWatch, at the center of the controversy. Tom's Hardware reports: A post on the site claims, "Facebook's internal policy makers decided that Linux is malware and labeled groups associated with Linux as being 'cybersecurity threats.' We tried to post some blurb about distrowatch.com on Facebook and can confirm that it was barred with a message citing Community Standards. DistroWatch says that the Facebook ban took effect on January 19. Readers have reported difficulty posting links to the site on this social media platform. Moreover, some have told DistroWatch that their Facebook accounts have been locked or limited after sharing posts mentioning Linux topics.
 
If you're wondering if there might be something specific to DistroWatch.com, something on the site that the owners/operators perhaps don't even know about, for example, then it seems pretty safe to rule out such a possibility. Reports show that "multiple groups associated with Linux and Linux discussions have either been shut down or had many of their posts removed." However, we tested a few other Facebook posts with mentions of Linux, and they didn't get blocked immediately. Copenhagen-hosted DistroWatch says it has tried to appeal against the Community Standards-triggered ban. However, they say that a Facebook representative said that Linux topics would remain on the cybersecurity filter. The DistroWatch writer subsequently got their Facebook account locked... DistroWatch points out the irony at play here: "Facebook runs much of its infrastructure on Linux and often posts job ads looking for Linux developers." 

UPDATE: Facebook has admited they made a mistake and stopped blocking the posts.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Collaborated With The Nazis During WW2?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBZZBN2RIU0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/FBZZBN2RIU0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2025 22:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[World War 2 created many impossible decisions for the people who fell victim to this all-consuming war.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

"This bill aligns Michigan with a majority of the country," according to the state's announcement, which says the bill "advances technological literacy" and ensures their students "are well-equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary for success in the workforce." 
Slashdot reader theodp writes:



From the Michigan House Fiscal Agency Analysis: "Supporters of the bill say that increasing access to computer science courses for students in schools should be a priority of the state in order to ensure that students can compete for the types of jobs that have good pay and will be needed in the coming decades." 
That analysis goes on to report that testifying in favor of the bill were tech-giant backed nonprofit Code.org (Microsoft is a $30 million Code.org donor), Amazon and AWS (Amazon is a $30+ million Code.org donor), the tech-supported Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), and the lobbying organization TechNet, whose members include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and OpenAI). 
It's not clear how many high schools in Michigan are already teaching CS courses, but this still raises a popular question for discussion. Should high schools be required to teach at least one CS course?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Brings Some Systems Faster Suspend and Resume</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/25/2343225/linux-614-brings-some-systems-faster-suspend-and-resume?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amid the ongoing Linux 6.14 kernel development cycle, Phoronix spotted a pull request for ACPI updates which "will allow for faster suspend and resume cycles on some systems." 

Wikipedia defines ACPI as "an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components" for things like power management and putting unused hardware components to sleep. Phoronix reports:

The ACPI change worth highlighting for Linux 6.14 is switching from msleep() to usleep_range() within the acpi_os_sleep() call in the kernel. This reduces spurious sleep time due to timer inaccuracy. Linux ACPI/PM maintainer Rafael Wysocki of Intel who authored this change noted that it could "spectacularly" reduce the duration of system suspend and resume transitions on some systems... 

Rafael explained in the patch making the sleep change: 

 "The extra delay added by msleep() to the sleep time value passed to it can be significant, roughly between 1.5 ns on systems with HZ = 1000 and as much as 15 ms on systems with HZ = 100, which is hardly acceptable, at least for small sleep time values." 
One 2022 bug report complained a Dell XPS 13 using Thunderbolt took "a full 8 seconds to suspend and a full 8 seconds to resume even though no physical devices are connected." In November an Intel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list that the fix gave a Dell XPS 13 a 42% improvement in kernel resume time (from 1943ms to 1127ms).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Does Ice Float?

"[P]otential investors who are engaged in the talks include Microsoft."

Under the deal now being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner ByteDance would retain a minority stake in the company, but the app's algorithm, data collection and software updates will be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's web infrastructure... "The goal is for Oracle to effectively monitor and provide oversight with what is going on with TikTok," said the person directly involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. "ByteDance wouldn't completely go away, but it would minimize Chinese ownership...." Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, according to the source involved in the discussions, who said Oracle is interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux... 


Under a law passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court, TikTok must execute what is known as "qualified divestiture" from ByteDance in order to stay in business in the U.S... A congressional staffer involved in talks about TikTok's future, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said binding legal agreements from the White House ensuring ByteDance cannot covertly manipulate the app will prove critical in winning lawmakers' approval. "A key part is showing there is no operational relationship with ByteDance, that they do not have control," the Congressional staffer said. "There needs to be no backdoors where China can potentially gain access...." 


Chinese regulators, who have for years opposed the selling of TikTok, recently signaled that they would not stand in the way of a TikTok ownership change, saying acquisitions "should be independently decided by the enterprises and based on market principles." The statement, at first, does not seem to say much, but negotiators in the White House believe it indicates that Beijing is not planning to block a deal that gives American investors a majority-stake position in the company.
 

"Meanwhile, Apple and Google still have not returned TikTok to app stores..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Chopin&apos;s Military Hallucinations with Karina Tseng and Anthony Ratinov</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diDnVUPRaYI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/diDnVUPRaYI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 02:19:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch Karina & Anthony's full Polonaise performances:

What’s Going on in the Containerd Neighborhood? - Phil Estes, AWS; Samuel Karp, Google; Akihiro Suda, NTT; Michael Brown, IBM; Kirtana Ashok, Microsoft

Our recent maintainer sessions have covered the soon-to-launch containerd v2.0. During this session led by maintainers we will give a brief update on 2.0, but will spend more time looking at the ecosystem around us. Why does containerd exist? What value does it bring to the overall cloud native world? How are other projects using it to build and extend containerd in useful ways? We’ll spend some time on containerd’s largest subproject, nerdctl, which also has an upcoming 2.0 release, and additionally catch the community up on activity in our Rust subproject ecosystem, the runwasi containerd shim, and lazy loading snapshotters. Since this is KubeCon, we’ll also provide an update on CRI changes and KEP-driven additions around NRI, DRA, and checkpoint/restore. Attendees will leave with a broad view of the larger containerd ecosystem of projects as well as key information on how to get involved if you are interested to help and contribute in any way to the “containerd neighborhood!”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome &amp; Introduction: A Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the CNCF Landscape- Katherine Druckman, Lori Lorusso</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCAOa0-VdU</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hTCAOa0-VdU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 23:37:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

It's the code that processes packets of network traffic, and Linux "is the most widely used OS for data center servers," according to the article:

The team tested their solution's effectiveness and submitted it to Linux for consideration, and the code was published this month as part of Linux's newest kernel, release version 6.13. "All these big companies — Amazon, Google, Meta — use Linux in some capacity, but they're very picky about how they decide to use it," said Martin Karsten [professor of Computer Science in the Waterloo's Math Faculty]. "If they choose to 'switch on' our method in their data centers, it could save gigawatt hours of energy worldwide. Almost every single service request that happens on the Internet could be positively affected by this." 

The University of Waterloo is building a green computer server room as part of its new mathematics building, and Karsten believes sustainability research must be a priority for computer scientists. "We all have a part to play in building a greener future," he said. The Linux Foundation, which oversees the development of the Linux OS, is a founder member of the Green Software Foundation, an organization set up to look at ways of developing "green software" — code that reduces energy consumption. 

Karsten "teamed up with Joe Damato, distinguished engineer at Fastly" to develop the 30 lines of code, according to an announcement from the university. "The Linux kernel code addition developed by Karsten and Damato was based on research published in ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review" (by Karsten and grad student Peter Cai). 

Their paper "reviews the performance characteristics of network stack processing for communication-heavy server applications," devising an "indirect methodology" to "identify and quantify the direct and indirect costs of asynchronous hardware interrupt requests (IRQ) as a major source of overhead... 

"Based on these findings, a small modification of a vanilla Linux system is devised that improves the efficiency and performance of traditional kernel-based networking significantly, resulting in up to 45% increased throughput..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expec...

Navigating the Cgroup Transition: Bridging the Gap Between Kubernetes and User Expectations - Sohan Kunkerkar, Red Hat Inc

As Kubernetes and container technologies evolve, shifting from cgroup v1 to cgroup v2 has become a pivotal development. With cgroup v2 available in Kubernetes since v1.25, we're at a crossroads where many users and organizations must decide when and how to transition fully to this new system. Despite the benefits of cgroup v2, including better resource management and enhanced capabilities, users frequently encounter unexpected challenges signaling a gap in readiness and understanding. This talk will address the practical implications of moving to cgroup v2, discuss the coordinated efforts to deprecate cgroup v1, and propose actionable strategies to bridge the gap between the Kubernetes community, system administrators, and developers. By focusing on real-world experiences and providing clear guidance, this session aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools to navigate this significant change confidently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>JRE MMA Show #165 with Jiri Prochazka</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfgsPUMCaM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lpfgsPUMCaM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Joe sits down with Jiří Procházka, a professional mixed martial artist currently competing in the Light Heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.

Is consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it’s so hard to pin down what makes you “you.” From Descartes’ “beast machines” to Darwin’s revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. 

Will AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness—or even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids—tiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us—and why it matters.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

// Bio

"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores in different places, but to build a single, cross-platform store in which, within the era of multi-platform games, if you buy a game or digital items in one place, you have the ability to own them everywhere," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters during a press briefing. The Verge reports: Under the program, Epic will offer new free games in the store each month before eventually switching to a weekly schedule. However, the games aren't actually in the store yet -- Epic said on Thursday that it "ran into a few bugs that we're working through now" and "we'll provide an update once the games are live and ready to play!"
 
To sweeten the deal for developers that participate in the free games program on iOS, Epic will help defray the cost of using third-party marketplaces. For one year, it will pay these developers' Core Technology Fee (CTF): a 50 euro cent fee levied on every install of an iOS app that uses third-party stores after it exceeds 1 million annual downloads. (Apple gives developers with less than 10 million euros in global revenue a three-year on-ramp.) [...] Epic writes in its blog post that covering the fee "is not financially viable for every third party app store or for Epic long term, but we'll do it while the European Commission investigates Apple's non-compliance with the law."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Panama Canal</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-panama-canal</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/679116867e5a4982476a84b0/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=awug-Mo6-Ic-lR51OOIDX5aFz_rgMofpwEwQhaVnSlM" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the history of the Panama Canal and why does Trump think he can 'take it back'? Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.14 Adds Support For The Microsoft Copilot Key Found On New Laptops</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2333254/linux-614-adds-support-for-the-microsoft-copilot-key-found-on-new-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Linux 6.14 kernel now maps out support for Microsoft's "Copilot" key "so that user-space software can determine the behavior for handling that key's action on the Linux desktop," writes Phoronix's Michael Larabel.

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders.

The universe is expanding and that expansion is accelerating under the power of dark energy and eventually all matter and energy will be dispersed over such unthinkable distances that nothing can stop space from blowing up infinitely. Unless of course cosmologists blundered and dark energy doesn't even exist. Then it's back to the drawing board.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

Lesson by Sajan Saini and George Zaidan, directed by Jeff Le Bars, JetPropulsion.space.

The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.On January 7, PowerSchool revealed that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal. Information stolen included individuals’ names, contact information, dates of birth, medical alert information, Social Security Numbers, and unspecified “other related information.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers say new attack could take down the European power grid</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/could-hackers-use-new-attack-to-take-down-european-power-grid/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/euripean-ripple-attack-flipper-zero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last month, researchers revealed a finding that’s likely to shock some people and confirm the low expectations of others: Renewable energy facilities throughout Central Europe use unencrypted radio signals to receive commands to feed or ditch power into or from the grid that serves some 450 million people throughout the continent.Fabian Bräunlein and Luca Melette stumbled on their discovery largely by accident while working on what they thought would be a much different sort of hacking project. After observing a radio receiver on the streetlight poles throughout Berlin, they got to wondering: Would it be possible for someone with a central transmitter to control them en masse, and if so, could they create a city-wide light installation along the lines of Project Blinkenlights?

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).→ A collection (or list) of books → A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. → Fetch all books → Create a new book → Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Love letter from 1940&apos;s that Amy Tan&apos;s dad sent to her mom 🥰 #FindingYourRoots #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ifdDk5LMJs</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-ifdDk5LMJs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Henry Louis Gates, Jr. shares with Amy Tan the love letters from her father to her mother written in the 1940's which researchers found in Shanghai court archives.

Stories about drug use by Hitler and German forces during World War II have been widely told. What’s less well known is the Allied commanders’ embraced pharmacological “force enhancers” as well.  By 1941, rumors about Nazi soldiers using a “super-drug” identified as the methamphetamine Pervitin were confirmed, and Allied commanders launched their own classified program to find the perfect war-fighting drug.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There’s a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there’s no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn’t run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user’s data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don’t lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don’t like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here’s how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It’s easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it’s possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it’s necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn’t store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it’s stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user’s followers.Yet it’s expensive to push updates to each follower’s repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn’t index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user’s actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn’t contain this information. So the stream’s data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower’s repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here’s the workflow for displaying a post:A user’s request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server’s disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user’s unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‘bsky.social’ subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don’t affect their previous posts.A user’s DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user’s handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here’s how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user’s timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user’s repository doesn’t contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user’s timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed’s content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post’s timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result’s offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter’s window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it’s possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here’s how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay’s Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let’s dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won’t scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don’t use different CPU cores at once. So here’s how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user’s DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let’s take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it’s inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won’t scale for Bluesky’s needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it’s stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won’t scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap’s serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it’s a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it’s included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here’s how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user’s data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn’t store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user’s repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here’s how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server’s request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

He will be succeeded by Nikki Santoro, who has served as the chief operating officer since 2021. TechCrunch reports: Santoro's appointment is significant, as she is the first woman to become the CEO and only the second person to hold the position. Needham founded IMDb in 1990 at the age of 23, steering the company into a powerhouse within the entertainment industry. After 35 years, he'll transition to a new role as executive chair.
 
According to Needham, Santoro's ascension is well deserved. [...] Santoro has been with the company since 2016, leading the company in expanding its database and improving its IMDbPro membership. She previously held leadership positions at Amazon, Microsoft, and The Weather Channel. "Nikki's strategic vision, deep understanding of our customers and products, and commitment to innovation have already delivered impressive business results during her tenure as COO," said Needham in a statement. "Her track record of driving growth and enhancing our products and services makes her the ideal person to guide IMDb into a new era."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How WW1 Inspired The Lord of The Rings</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/tolkien-in-the-trenches-how-ww1-shaped-lord-of-the-rings</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6746005578f05cc6cc55e5d4/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BhhPK2bfU_hyRBJ8-JYzfJGAC_5vwJ7LDRNuGzt_o38" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:30:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After Hitler: The Cleanup That Followed WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTRLhs9tI70</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gTRLhs9tI70?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary tells the story of the clean-up that followed WW2.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JS7UMDHz3Qc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people’s diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed—Open APIs and Internal APIs—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python’s built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list  fruits = ["apple", "banana"] fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element  fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[   { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },   { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" } ]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">    <soapenv:Header/>    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalance>          <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>       </bank:GetAccountBalance>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope> <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">    <soapenv:Body>       <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>          <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>       </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>    </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{   user(id: 123) {     name     email     posts {       title       likes     }   } }{   "data": {     "user": {       "name": "Alice",       "email": "alice@example.com",       "posts": [         { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },         { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }       ]     }   } }gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here’s a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests  url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY" response = requests.get(url)  if response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C") else:     print("Error:", response.status_code) – Sends an API request. – Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 – Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don’t always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:     data = response.json()     print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}") elif response.status_code == 401:     print("Error: Invalid API key") elif response.status_code == 404:     print("Error: City not found") else:     print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture:
Enhancements.In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten
Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject.The Enhancements subprojectFrederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements
subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject’s work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).: We’re currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/128/changelog-news-128.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the “personal” back in “personal computer”, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

For over 1,200 years from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD, the Kingdom of Kush flourished and at its height was one of the largest empires in the ancient world, ruling from the Blue Nile to the Levant.

Item 1: 00:56
Item 2: 05:44
Item 3: 12:28
Item 4: 17:56
Item 5: 24:10

This upcoming exhibition will examine this ancient culture's skilled craftsmanship, distinct religious beliefs, and the important role of women, as well as exploring the rich culture of modern Sudan. Highlights include beautiful examples of ceramics, a carved stone offering table and a striking bronze depiction of a goddess. 

Ancient Sudan: enduring heritage will be on display at Portsmouth Museum and Art Gallery (1 February – 11 May 2025), and Stirling Smith Art Gallery & Museum (9 August – 9 November 2025). Find out more here: www.britishmuseum.org/ancientsudan

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67892eb0c2824244c27b929f/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=3pCPGiAXWzux-J-3YCe1OwbmIbvcy6B9C-AaxFO1HJk" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jennifer Burns: Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand, Economics, Capitalism, Freedom | Lex Fridman Podcast #457</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz-4ulRKnz4</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Rz-4ulRKnz4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 19:27:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jennifer Burns is a historian of ideas, focusing on the evolution of economic, political, and social ideas in the United States in the 20th century.

But now it can do it even better, explains Marco Ippolito of the Node.js steering committee:

In August 2024 Node.js introduced a new experimental feature, Type Stripping, aimed at addressing a longstanding challenge in the Node.js ecosystem: running TypeScript with no configuration. Enabled by default in Node.js v23.6.0, this feature is on its way to becoming stable. 


TypeScript has reached incredible levels of popularity and has been the most requested feature in all the latest Node.js surveys. Unlike other alternatives such as CoffeeScript or Flow, which never gained similar traction, TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern development. While it has been supported in Node.js for some time through loaders, they relied heavily on configuration and user libraries. This reliance led to inconsistencies between different loaders, making them difficult to use interchangeably. The developer experience suffered due to these inconsistencies and the extra setup required... The goal is to make development faster and simpler, eliminating the overhead of configuration while maintaining the flexibility that developers expect... 

TypeScript is not just a language, it also relies on a toolchain to implement its features. The primary tool for this purpose is tsc, the TypeScript compiler CLI... Type checking is tightly coupled to the implementation of tsc, as there is no formal specification for how the language's type system should behave. This lack of a specification means that the behavior of tsc is effectively the definition of TypeScript's type system. tsc does not follow semantic versioning, so even minor updates can introduce changes to type checking that may break existing code. Transpilation, on the other hand, is a more stable process. It involves converting TypeScript code into JavaScript by removing types, transforming certain syntax constructs, and optionally "downleveling" the JavaScript to allow modern syntax to execute on older JavaScript engines. Unlike type checking, transpilation is less likely to change in breaking ways across versions of tsc. The likelihood of breaking changes is further reduced when we only consider the minimum transpilation needed to make the TypeScript code executable — and exclude downleveling of new JavaScript features not yet available in the JavaScript engine but available in TypeScript... 

Node.js, before enabling it by default, introduced --experimental-strip-types. This mode allows running TypeScript files by simply stripping inline types without performing type checking or any other code transformation. This minimal technique is known as Type Stripping. By excluding type checking and traditional transpilation, the more unstable aspects of TypeScript, Node.js reduces the risk of instability and mostly sidesteps the need to track minor TypeScript updates. Moreover, this solution does not require any configuration in order to execute code... Node.js eliminates the need for source maps by replacing the removed syntax with blank spaces, ensuring that the original locations of the code and structure remain intact. It is transparent — the code that runs is the code the author wrote, minus the types... 

"As this experimental feature evolves, the Node.js team will continue collaborating with the TypeScript team and the community to refine its behavior and reduce friction. You can check the roadmap for practical next steps..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Horrifying Things We Used To Use As Medicine</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qwdBt9ZBr8</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6qwdBt9ZBr8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 15:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s hard to imagine a world where illnesses were treated with things like rushing currents or leeches, but not so long ago, that was the case.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

The findings appear in a pre-print paper titled "How is Google using AI for internal code migrations?" The Register reports: Their focus is on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas, such as Ads, Search, Workspace and YouTube, instead of generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services like code completion, code review, and question answering. Google's code migrations involved: changing 32-bit IDs in the 500-plus-million-line codebase for Google Ads to 64-bit IDs; converting its old JUnit3 testing library to JUnit4; and replacing the Joda time library with Java's standard java.time package. The int32 to int64 migration, the Googlers explain, was not trivial as the IDs were often generically defined (int32_t in C++ or Integer in Java) and were not easily searchable. They existed in tens of thousands of code locations across thousands of files. Changes had to be tracked across multiple teams and changes to class interfaces had to be considered across multiple files. "The full effort, if done manually, was expected to require hundreds of software engineering years and complex crossteam coordination," the authors explain.
 
For their LLM-based workflow, Google's software engineers implemented the following process. An engineer from Ads would identify an ID in need of migration using a combination of code search, Kythe, and custom scripts. Then an LLM-based migration toolkit, triggered by someone knowledgeable in the art, was run to generate verified changes containing code that passed unit tests. Those changes would be manually checked by the same engineer and potentially corrected. Thereafter, the code changes would be sent to multiple reviewers who are responsible for the portion of the codebase affected by the changes. The result was that 80 percent of the code modifications in the change lists (CLs) were purely the product of AI; the remainder were either human-authored or human-edited AI suggestions.
 
"We discovered that in most cases, the human needed to revert at least some changes the model made that were either incorrect or not necessary," the authors observe. "Given the complexity and sensitive nature of the modified code, effort has to be spent in carefully rolling out each change to users." Based on this, Google undertook further work on LLM-driven verification to reduce the need for detailed review. Even with the need to double-check the LLM's work, the authors estimate that the time required to complete the migration was reduced by 50 percent. With LLM assistance, it took just three months to migrate 5,359 files and modify 149,000 lines of code to complete the JUnit3-JUnit4 transition. Approximately 87 percent of the code generated by AI ended up being committed with no changes. As for the Joda-Java time framework switch, the authors estimate a time saving of 89 percent compared to the projected manual change time, though no specifics were provided to support that assertion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Other people&apos;s robots (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/76</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/friends/76/changelog--friends-76.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod & Adam discuss Nvidia’s recently announced personal AI supercomputer, Waymo’s latest infinite loop, what’s involved in getting a “modern” terminal setup, and whether or not AI has gone mainstream… warts & all!Changelog++ members get a bonus 8 minutes at the end of this episode and zero ads.

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

First, you're getting the Copilot-powered AI features that Microsoft has been rolling out to businesses and Copilot Pro subscribers, like summarizing or generating text in Word, drafting slideshows in PowerPoint based on a handful of criteria, or analyzing data in Excel. Second, you'll be paying more for the privilege of using those features, to the tune of an extra $3 a month or $30 a year.This raises the price of a Microsoft 365 Personal subscription from $7 a month or $70 a year to $10 and $100; a family subscription goes from $10 a month or $100 a year to $13 a month or $130 a year. For current subscribers, these prices go into effect the next time your plan renews.Current subscribers are also being given an escape hatch "for a limited time." "Classic" Personal and Family plans at the old prices with no Copilot features included will still be offered, but you'll need to go to the "services & subscriptions" page of your Microsoft account and attempt to cancel your existing subscription to be offered the discounted pricing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Romanovs: The Truth Behind The Downfall of the Russian Empire</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcS056KiJa0</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/hcS056KiJa0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For three hundred years Russia was ruled by one family: the Romanovs.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Forensics with Emre Tinaztepe</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/16/digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED2585624665.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data for investigative purposes.

It wasn’t a subject covered in college, and I had no prior experience building scalable systems.But, over time, I realized that you don’t need professional experience with distributed systems to pass system design interviews.Even experienced engineers often find these interviews challenging because the format is unique and requires a specific approach.The good news is that once you understand the , the , and , and learn how to connect them effectively, system design interviews become far less intimidating.In this article, I’ll share  that improved my system design interview skills and made it significantly easier—and hopefully, they’ll do the same for you.In a system design interview, the interviewer evaluates your ability to , , and .Here’s what they are looking for: Can you ask the right questions to clarify functional and non-functional requirements? Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Record of Their Time (RA Winter Lecture)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHrTliHUt6k</link><author>Royal Armouries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qHrTliHUt6k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 02:57:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMX-XuiEkBi4-GDrYuniWg">Royal Armouries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Speakers: Dr Krysten Blackstone, Lecturer in International and Military History, University of Salford and Jonathan Jeffries

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

It is a popular tool for sending or receiving files, making backups, or setting up mirrors.

Rsync versions 3.3.0 and below has been found with SIX serious vulnerabilities. Attackers could exploit these to leak your data, corrupt your files, or even take over your system. There is a heap-based buffer overflow with a CVSS score of 9.8 that needs to be addressed on both the client and server sides of rsync package.

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections. Hence, knowing SSH client control commands can save you time and boost your productivity when such gotchas occur. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parallels Can Now Run x86 Windows and Linux On Apple Silicon Mac</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/15/0216248/parallels-can-now-run-x86-windows-and-linux-on-apple-silicon-mac?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop now supports running 64-bit x86 operating systems on Apple Silicon Macs through its proprietary emulation engine, enabling users to run traditional Windows and Linux distributions. However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Owns Greenland?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/who-owns-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/678573f83f68018e6a0c098d/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=aK2ez0HAnyG6saKrZTvRIj4SynUteRmJb9DZo3TAn-U" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NuPhy Air60HE keyboard review (Gateron Low-profile Magnetic Jade Pro)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGI03Vdsj5s</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/tGI03Vdsj5s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:31:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 7:40 for a typing demonstration.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WqljXZGTfug?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

While you can have many different screens in a single application, only one screen may be active at a time.When you create your  class, Textual will create a screen object implicitly. Yes, Textual requires you to have at least one screen or your application won’t work. If you do not create a new screen or switch to a different one, the default screen is where your widgets will get mounted or composed to.Screens are a great way to organize your application. Many applications have settings pages, help pages, and more. These are just a few examples of how you can use screens.Now that you know what a screen is, you’re ready to learn how to create new ones!When you create an application, you create a  implicitly. But how do you create your own ? Fortunately, Textual has made that easy. All you need to do is import the  class from  and extend it as needed.You can style screens the same way you do other widgets, except for the dimensions as screens are always the same size as your terminal window.To see how this all works, you will create an application with two screens:You second screen, which will be greenYou will be able to switch between the screens using a button. Each screen has its own button and its own event or message handler.Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called  with the following contents:# two_screens.py

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button

class GreenScreen(Screen):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Button("Main Screen", id="main")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#main")
    def on_main(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()


class MainAop(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("Switch", id="switch")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#switch")
    def on_switch(self) -> None:
        self.push_screen(GreenScreen())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()You use Textual’s handy  decorator to match against the button’s . That keeps the message from bubbling around to other event handlers, which is what could happen if you had used , for example.When you run your application, you will see something like this:Try clicking the buttons and switching between the screens.Of course, you don’t need to use button’s at all, if you don’t want to. You could use keyboard shortcuts instead. Why not give that a try?Go back to your Python IDE and create a new file called  with this code in it:# two_screens_keys_only.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Label


class GreenScreen(Screen):
    BINDINGS = [("escape", "app.pop_screen", "Dismiss the screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Label("Second Screen")


class MainAop(App):
    SCREENS = {"green": GreenScreen}
    BINDINGS = [("n", "push_screen('green')", "Green Screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Label("Main screen")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()Using keyboard shortcuts makes your code a little less verbose. However, since you aren’t using a  widget, the shortcuts are not shown on-screen to the user. When you are on the main screen, you must press the letter “n” on your keyboard to switch to the . Then when you want to switch back, you press “Esc” or escape.Here’s what the screen looks like on the :Now try using the keys mentioned to swap between the two screens. Feel free to change the keyboard bindings to keys of your own choosing.Textual can do much more with Screens than what is covered in this brief tutorial. However, you can use this information as a great starting point for learning how to add one more additional screens to your GUI in your terminal.Play around with these examples and then run over to the Textual documentation to learn about some of the other widgets you can add to bring your application to life.If you’d like to learn more about Textual, check out my book: Creating TUI Applications with Textual and Python, which you can find on the following websites:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One of the most controversial medical procedures in history - Jenell Johnson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3d2DlLX7xw</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/w3d2DlLX7xw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 16:01:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Uncover the history of the lobotomy, and find out why it's considered one of the most controversial procedures of the 20th century.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness— leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

Donald Trump has promised to conduct “the largest deportation effort in American history,” no matter what it costs—but the price tag may be bigger than expected.

In today's video we look at a history of US border control and the economic costs of deporting more than six percent of the US workforce while the US workforce ages.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Heroku and the Twelve-Factor App with Vish Abrams</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/14/heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=heroku-and-the-twelve-factor-app-with-vish-abrams</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED5934449149.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 10:00:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Heroku is a cloud platform-as-a-service that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications.

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding. Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.💡  Record yourself solving a problem.Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.Interviewers don’t expect perfection—they expect clarity and problem-solving skills.6. And Finally, You Need to Build ResilienceLet’s talk about failure.It’s not if—it’s when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.But every “wrong answer” was a chance to learn something new.💡  Keep a failure journal.Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you’ll tackle similar issues in the future.Failure isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of better solutions.Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:Section for training as a team.Educational section to learn new topics.Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.Slightly advanced topics.The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.If you’ve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life—more on that in this post:Competitive Programming Changed My Life ForeverI’m writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden—a place where I’ve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life…a month ago · 31 likes · 7 comments · Alberto GonzalezYour dream job isn’t just about a bigger paycheck.

To qualify, developers must have a 2024 commit in Torvalds' kernel git tree and email him with the subject "I WANT A GUITAR PEDAL". He'll pick a winner at random, use his own money to buy a pedal kit from a company called Aion FX, and then 'build it with my own shaky little fingers, and send it to the victim by US postal services.'" The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."
 
"I will test the result to the best of my abilities, and the end result may actually work ... but you should set your expectations along the lines of "quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EP31 Kushite Conversations</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wz1WPfI34</link><author>Dan Carlin</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/N1wz1WPfI34?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 22:26:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RcjbuyF5M1U4R62zjE3hg">Dan Carlin</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dan talks with writer, broadcaster and journalist Zeinab Badawi about the ancient African kingdom of Kush and her book on African history.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The new $30,000 side hustle (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/127</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/127/changelog-news-127.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bloomberg reports on a concerning new trend in tech hiring, Sean Goedecke has a lot to say about large established codebases, Jacob Bartlett thinks Apple is ruining Swift’s original vision, Ahmed Khaleel built a cool tool for turning GitHub repos into interactive diagrams & Bridget Harris goes deep on the potential of crypto stablecoins to disrupt Visa and Mastercard’s duopoly.Changelog++ members save 1 minute on this episode because they made the ads disappear.

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US splits world into three tiers for AI chip access</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/us_digital_flag_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the US government announced a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those manufactured by Nvidia, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>One reason movies are so dark now</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSJcnUUJlPA</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/HSJcnUUJlPA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 13:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital cameras have driven this change, but not in the way you think.

"You've heard it all before. But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want..." 

He's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as "a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro."

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players — including Intel and AMD — in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roald Amundsen</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roald-amundsen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6765bf1e575cbdaa9d89bede/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=9jVYK1UV2_PMoWc2X_u4mlskXFK1CvhoaIrf4qRmQGI" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:05:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Biggest Scandals In American History | Compilation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAToMpLpM6Q</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AAToMpLpM6Q?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scandals have grabbed attention throughout history!

Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.On June 13, 1863, a letter published in The Press newspaper of Christchurch warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently popped up again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the . The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position.

Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.My immediate reaction was “oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn’t that
hard, you just need to….”, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
“you just need to…” list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a “modern” terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.what is a “modern terminal experience”?Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:multiline support for copy and paste: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediatly run them all! That’s scary! (, ): if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (): I can’t live without having my  and  in my prompt (): this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours () between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press  in vim to paste (, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too): for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete () (): I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor’s theme. (, )automatic terminal fixing: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn’t get messed up (): I want  to work ( or )being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like : ( and )There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.how I achieve a “modern experience”use the  shell. Mostly don’t configure it, except to:
set the  environment variable to my favourite terminal editoruse any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I’ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I’m not picky about this. I don’t really
configure it other than to choose a font.use , with a configuration that I’ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)A few things that affect my approach:I don’t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machinesI’d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everythingI work on a lot of small projects, not one big projectsome “out of the box” options for a “modern” experienceWhat if you want a nice experience, but don’t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminalmac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn’t have 256-colour support)cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghosttyshell config:
set the  environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editormaybe alias  to text editor: this is a tough one, maybe micro or helix? I haven’t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it’s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
( to copy,  to paste,  to select all) in micro and
they do what you’d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn’t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.Personally I  use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I’ve found in the past that they’re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app’s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.I don’t want to pretend that getting a “modern” terminal experience is easier
than it is though – I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let’s talk
about them!issue 1 with getting to a “modern” experience: the shellbash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:you need to customize your promptthey don’t come with git completions by default, you have to set them upby default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lotI find bash’s tab completion very frustrating, if there’s more than
one match then you can’t tab through themAnd even though I love fish, the fact
that it isn’t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.Of course it’s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn’t even need to be that complicated (in bash I’d
probably start with something like export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ', or maybe use starship).
But each of these “not complicated” things really does add up and it’s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.An extremely popular solution to getting a “modern” shell experience is
oh-my-zsh. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I’ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past – it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what’s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it’s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.issue 2 with getting to a “modern” experience: the text editorIn the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were , , and .I think the main options for terminal text editors are:use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the workuse nano and accept that you’re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don’t think you can select text with the mouse and then “cut”
it in nano)use  or  which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editorjust avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode’s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use  as their  in the terminal.issue 3: individual applicationsThe last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine,  doesn’t support
the  keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:realize why this is happening (Mac OS won’t ship GNU tools, and “Ctrl-Left arrow” support comes from GNU readline)find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)adjust my environment (put Homebrew’s sqlite3 in my PATH)I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn’t feel “worth it” – often I’ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don’t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I’ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.A big part of having a “modern” experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can’t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in , but in   I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more “modern” command line tools isn’t easy (though
I made a list here),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you’re
SSHed into another machine, they won’t always be there.everything affects everything elseSomething I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything “nice”
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don’t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I’d need to think about a few things, like:if I wanted tmux’s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I’d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has OSC 52 supportif I wanted to use iTerm’s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I’d need to change how I configure colours – right now I set them
with a shell script that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.and probably more things I haven’t thought of. “Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours” sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided “well, I don’t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I’m not using that feature!”.It’s also hard to remember which features I’m relying on – for example maybe
my current terminal  have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don’t even realize that that’s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.Personally even though I think my setup is not  complicated, it’s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I’ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there’s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using  to eza a year or two ago and
while I like it (because  prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I’m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it’s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I’m
very happy I did.getting a “modern” terminal is not that easyTrying to explain how “easy” it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it’s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.I’ve found that there’s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Keychron Q0 Max macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPk09Ars-JE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xPk09Ars-JE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-max-qmk-custom-number-pad

But the report's broader analysis paints a far more nuanced picture than CNN's headline suggests: It finds that AI could create 170 million new jobs globally while eliminating 92 million positions, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs by 2030."Half of employers plan to re-orient their business in response to AI," writes the WEF in the report. "Two-thirds plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks."The survey collected data from 1,000 companies that employ 14 million workers globally. The WEF conducts its employment analysis every two years to help policymakers, business leaders, and workers make decisions about hiring trends.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
