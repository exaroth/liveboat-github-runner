This method delivers ultra-high radiation doses in less than a second, minimizes side effects while targeting tumors more effectively than conventional radiotherapy. The BBC reports: In a series of vast underground caverns on the outskirts of Geneva, Switzerland, experiments are taking place which may one day lead to new generation of radiotherapy machines. The hope is that these devices could make it possible to cure complex brain tumors (PDF), eliminate cancers that have metastasized to distant organs, and generally limit the toll which cancer treatment exerts on the human body. The home of these experiments is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (Cern), best known to the world as the particle physics hub that developed the Large Hadron Collider, a 27 kilometer (16.7 mile)-long ring of superconducting magnets capable of accelerating particles to near the speed of light.
 
Arguably Cern's crowning achievement was the 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson, the so-called "God Particle" which gives other particles their mass and in doing so lays the foundation for everything that exists in the universe. But in recent years, the centre's unique expertise in accelerating high-energy particles has found a new niche -- the world of cancer radiotherapy. Eleven years ago, Marie-Catherine Vozenin, a radiobiologist now working at Geneva University Hospitals (Hug), and others published a paper outlining a paradigm-shifting approach to traditional radiotherapy treatment which they called Flash. By delivering radiation at ultra-high dose rates, with exposures of less than a second, they showed that it was possible to destroy tumors in rodents while sparing healthy tissue. Its impact was immediate. International experts described it as a seminal breakthrough, and it galvanized fellow radiobiologists around the world to conduct their own experiments using the Flash approach to treat a wide variety of tumors in rodents, household pets, and now humans.
 
In recent years, animal studies have repeatedly shown that Flash makes it possible to markedly increase the amount of radiation delivered to the body while minimizing the impact that it has on surrounding healthy tissue. In one experiment, healthy lab mice which were given two rounds of radiation via Flash did not develop the typical side effects which would be expected during the second round. In another study, animals treated with Flash for head and neck cancers experienced fewer side effects, such as reduced saliva production or difficulty swallowing. Loo is cautiously optimistic that going forwards, such benefits may also translate to human patients. "Flash produces less normal tissue injury than conventional irradiation, without compromising anti-tumor efficacy -- which could be game-changing," he says. An additional hope is that this could then reduce the risk of secondary cancers (PDF), resulting from radiation-induced damage later in life, although it is still too early to know if that will be the case. [...] But the next phase of research is not only about testing whether Flash works in people. It's also about identifying which kind of radiation is the best one to use.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cutting-edge technology: AI robots made in Germany | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3NmYL__-KA</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 06:45:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Neura Robotics, a German company is pushing the boundaries of robotics and AI technology.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it would delay the effective date to March 20 to give the new Trump administration time to further review the regulation.
 
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and other automakers, last week filed suit to block the rule, saying the regulation is "practically impossible with available technology." The group asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn the rule, saying the requirement that cars and trucks must be able to stop and avoid striking vehicles in front of them at up to 62 miles per hour (100 kph) is unrealistic. It unsuccessfully asked NHTSA last year to reconsider the rule. Come 2029, all cars sold in the U.S. "must be able to stop and avoid contact with a vehicle in front of them at speeds up to 62 mph," reports Car and Driver."
 
"Additionally, the system must be able to detect pedestrians in both daylight and darkness. As a final parameter, the federal standard will require the system to apply the brakes automatically up to 90 mph when a collision is imminent, and up to 45 mph when a pedestrian is detected."
 
According to the NHTSA, the rule will save at least 360 lives annually and prevent more than 24,000 injuries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Senate votes on Pete Hegseth as defense secretary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyrCHJVkbG4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 03:27:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as the Senate is muscling Pete Hegseth’s nomination as defense secretary toward confirmation Friday.

As a result, there will be no more new feature updates for these architectures; however, CUDA and gaming driver support will remain for now. From the report: It's crucial to highlight that this has nothing to do with GeForce gaming driver support. In fact, Maxwell and Pascal continue to be on the support list for the GeForce RTX series driver, unlike Kepler. Nvidia didn't detail whether or when it'll drop support for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPUs for the gaming driver.
 
Nvidia has not issued an exact date for the end of full support for these three GPU architectures, but it will soon. The current CUDA toolkit still supports the three affected architectures, but they won't receive future updates. Once the move goes through, the only remaining GTX-series GPUs with full support will be the GTX 16-series, based on the RTX 20-series' Turing architecture.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will #Trump Defend #Taiwan Against #China? #politics #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEPdqsrEYyY</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:00:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Taiwan has long relied on US support to defend itself against China.

The move disrupted operations and forced the closure of temporary exhibitions. The Guardian reports: While the museum will remain open this weekend, only a handful of ticket holders will be able to access its paid-for exhibitions, such as its Silk Roads show, because the IT system that manages bookings has been rendered unusable. The incident caused chaos in the middle of a busy Friday afternoon and is the latest security issue to blight the institution. A statement on the museum's website on Friday said that "due to an IT infrastructure issue some galleries have had to be closed. Please note that this means capacity will be limited, and priority will be given to members and pre-booked ticket holders. Currently our exhibitions remain closed."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Uncached Buffered I/O &amp; Some Other Nice Memory Management Optimizations With Linux 6.14</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-MM</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 01:28:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Morton made for an exciting Friday evening by sending out his "MM" pull request for Linux 6.14 as the large collection of memory management related patches for this next kernel version...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wall Street slips with mixed data and earnings ahead of Fed week | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIv2MJTtss</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 01:21:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Wall Street's main indexes closed lower as investors stepped back while they digested a mixed bag of economic data and earnings reports and prepared for a week filled with economic releases and a Federal Reserve meeting.

He himself recognises that the CDU for success needs women voters. But the younger the women are that get polled, the worse he does. Below 18, he's even below 9%. Well, you can say that doesn't really matter because they're not going to vote anyway. The voting age in Germany is 18, but above that it's not that terribly much more. And he just simply comes across as a man of the 90s. He's tone deaf to the issue of women's representation. Just as an example, in 2023, there were seven tickets for the Munich Security Conference for his party. He sent seven men. He doesn't have anyone who's very a close advisor to him who's female, his spokespeople, all men. Only the head of the Konrad Adenauer house of the party, that's a female speaker.

Note that update is phrased in terms of  some value  to the existing value; we can also  a given index to a new value  by adding , where  is the old value. If we simply store the integers in a mutable array, then we can update in constant time, but range queries require time linear in the size of the range, since we must iterate through the entire range  to add up the values. In order to improve the running time of range queries, we could try to cache (at least some of) the range sums. However, this must be done with care, since the cached sums must be kept up to date when updating the value at an index. For example, a straightforward approach would be to use an array  where  stores the prefix sum ;  can be precomputed in linear time via a scan. Now range queries are fast: we can obtain  in constant time by computing  (for convenience we set  so this works even when ). Unfortunately, it is update that now takes linear time, since changing  requires updating  for every . Is it possible to design a data structure that allows  operations to run in sublinear time? (You may wish to pause and think about it before reading the next paragraph!) This is not just academic: the problem was originally considered in the context of  (Rissanen & Langdon, 1979; Bird & Gibbons, 2002), a family of techniques for turning messages into sequences of bits for storage or transmission. In order to minimize the bits required, one generally wants to assign shorter bit sequences to more frequent characters, and vice versa; this leads to the need to maintain a dynamic table of character frequencies. We  the table every time a new character is processed and  the table for cumulative frequencies in order to subdivide a unit interval into consecutive segments proportional to the frequency of each character (Ryabko, 1989; Fenwick, 1994). So, can we get both operations to run in sublinear time? The answer, of course, is yes. One simple technique is to divide the sequence into  buckets, each of size , and create an additional array of size  to cache the sum of each bucket. Updates still run in (1), since we simply have to update the value at the given index and the corresponding bucket sum. Range queries now run in  time: to find the sum , we manually add the values from  to the end of its bucket, and from  to the beginning of its bucket; for all the buckets in between we can just look up their sum. We can make range queries even faster, at the cost of making updates slightly slower, by introducing additional levels of caching. For example, we can divide the sequence into  “big buckets” and then further subdivide each big bucket into  “small buckets”, with each small bucket holding  values. The sum of each bucket is cached; now each update requires modifying three values, and range queries run in  time. In the limit, we end up with a binary divide-and-conquer approach to caching range sums, with both update and range query taking  time. In particular, we can make a balanced binary tree where the leaves store the sequence itself, and every internal node stores the sum of its children. (This will be a familiar idea to many functional programmers; for example, finger trees (Hinze & Paterson, 2006; Apfelmus, 2009) use a similar sort of caching scheme.) The resulting data structure is popularly known as a , presumably because each internal node ultimately caches the sum of a (contiguous)  of the underlying sequence. Figure 2 shows a segment tree built on a sample array of length  (for simplicity, we will assume that  is a power of two, although it is easy to generalize to situations where it is not). Each leaf of the tree corresponds to an array entry; each internal node is drawn with a grey bar showing the segment of the underlying array of which it is the sum. Let’s see how we can use a segment tree to implement the two required operations so that they run in logarithmic time. To update the value at index , we also need to update any cached range sums which include it. These are exactly the nodes along the path from the leaf at index  to the root of the tree; there are  such nodes. Figure 3 illustrates this update process for the example segment tree from Figure 2; updating the entry at index 5 requires modifying only the shaded nodes along the path from the root to the updated entry. To perform a range query, we descend through the tree while keeping track of the range covered by the current node. If the range of the current node is wholly contained within the query range, return the value of the current node. If the range of the current node is disjoint from the query range, return 0. Otherwise, recursively query both children and return the sum of the results. Figure 4 illustrates the process of computing the sum of the range . Blue nodes are the ones we recurse through; green nodes are those whose range is wholly contained in the query range and are returned without recursing further; grey nodes are disjoint from the query range and return zero. The final result in this example is the sum of values at the green nodes,  (it is easily verified that this is in fact the sum of values in the range ). Updating a segment tree. Performing a range query on a segment tree. On this small example tree, it may seem that we visit a significant fraction of the total nodes, but in general, we visit no more than about . Figure 5 makes this more clear. Only one blue node in the entire tree can have two blue children, and hence, each level of the tree can contain at most two blue nodes and two non-blue nodes. We essentially perform two binary searches, one to find each endpoint of the query range. Performing a range query on a larger segment tree. Segment trees are a very nice solution to the problem: as we will see in Section 2, they fit well in a functional language; they also lend themselves to powerful generalizations such as lazily propagated range updates and persistent update history via shared immutable structure (Ivanov, 2011)., or  (Fenwick, 1994; Ivanov, 2011), are an alternative solution to the problem. What they lack in generality, they make up for with an extremely small memory footprint—they require literally nothing more than an array storing the values in the tree—and a blazing fast implementation. In other words, they are perfect for applications such as low-level coding/decoding routines where we don’t need any of the advanced features that segment trees offer, and want to squeeze out every last bit of performance. Figure 6 shows a typical implementation of Fenwick trees in Java. As you can see, the implementation is incredibly concise and consists mostly of some small loops doing just a few arithmetic and bit operations per iteration. It is not at all clear what this code is doing, or how it works! Upon closer inspection, the , , and  functions are straightforward, but the other functions are a puzzle. We can see that both the  and  functions call another function , which for some reason performs a bitwise logical AND of an integer and its negation. In fact,  computes the  of , that is, it returns the smallest  such that the th bit of  is a one. However, it is not obvious how the implementation of  works, nor how and why least significant bits are being used to compute updates and prefix sums. Implementing Fenwick trees with bit tricks. Our goal is  to write elegant functional code for this—already solved!—problem. Rather, our goal will be to use a functional domain-specific language for bit strings, along with equational reasoning, to  and  this baffling imperative code from first principles—a demonstration of the power of functional thinking and equational reasoning to understand code written even in other, non-functional languages. After developing more intuition for segment trees (Section 2), we will see how Fenwick trees can be viewed as a variant on segment trees (Section 3). We will then take a detour into two’s complement binary encoding, develop a suitable DSL for bit manipulations, and explain the implementation of the  function (Section 4). Armed with the DSL, we will then derive functions for converting back and forth between Fenwick trees and standard binary trees (Section 5). Finally, we will be able to derive functions for moving within a Fenwick tree by converting to binary tree indices, doing the obvious operations to effect the desired motion within the binary tree, and then converting back. Fusing away the conversions via equational reasoning will finally reveal the hidden LSB function, as expected (Section 6). Figure 7 exhibits a simple implementation of a segment tree in Haskell, using some utilities for working with index ranges shown in Figure 8. We store a segment tree as a recursive algebraic data type and implement  and  using code that directly corresponds to the recursive descriptions given in the previous section;  and  can then also be implemented in terms of them. It is not hard to generalize this code to work for segment trees storing values from either an arbitrary commutative monoid if we don’t need the  operation—or from an arbitrary Abelian group (i.e. commutative monoid with inverses) if we do need —but we keep things simple since the generalization doesn’t add anything to our story. Simple segment tree implementation in Haskell. Although this implementation is simple and relatively straightforward to understand, compared to simply storing the sequence of values in an array, it incurs a good deal of overhead. We can be more clever in our use of space by storing all the nodes of a segment tree in an array, using the standard left-to-right breadth-first indexing scheme illustrated in Figure 9 (for example, this scheme, or something like it, is commonly used to implement binary heaps). The root has label 1; every time we descend one level we append an extra bit: 0 when we descend to the left child and 1 when we descend to the right. Thus, the index of each node expressed in binary records the sequence of left-right choices along the path to that node from the root. Going from a node to its children is as simple as doing a left bit shift and optionally adding 1; going from a node to its parent is a right bit shift. This defines a bijection from the positive natural numbers to the nodes of an infinite binary tree. If we label the segment tree array with , then  stores the sum of all the ,  stores the sum of the first half of the ,  stores the sum of the second half, and so on.  themselves are stored as . Indexing a binary tree. The important point is that since descending recursively through the tree corresponds to simple operations on indices, all the algorithms we have discussed can be straightforwardly transformed into code that works with a (mutable) array: for example, instead of storing a reference to the current subtree, we store an integer index; every time we want to descend to the left or right, we simply double the current index or double and add one, and so on. Working with tree nodes stored in an array presents an additional opportunity: rather than being forced to start at the root and recurse downwards, we can start at a particular index of interest and move  the tree instead. So how do we get from segment trees to Fenwick trees? We start with an innocuous-seeming observation: not all the values stored in a segment tree are necessary. Of course, all the non-leaf nodes are “unnecessary” in the sense that they represent cached range sums which could easily be recomputed from the original sequence. That’s the whole point: caching these “redundant” sums trades off space for time, allowing us to perform arbitrary updates and range queries quickly, at the cost of doubling the required storage space. But that’s not what I mean! In fact, there is a different set of values we can forget about, but in such a way that we still retain the logarithmic running time for updates and range queries. Which values, you ask? Simple: just forget the data stored in every node which is a right child. Figure 10 shows the same example tree we have been using, but with the data deleted from every right child. Note that “every right child” includes both leaves and internal nodes: we forget the data associated to  node which is the right child of its parent. We will refer to the nodes with discarded data as  and the remaining nodes (that is, left children and the root) as . We also say that a tree with all its right children inactivated in this way has been . Inactivating all right children in a segment tree. Updating a thinned segment tree is easy: just update the same nodes as before, ignoring any updates to inactive nodes. But how do we answer range queries? It’s not too hard to see that there is enough information remaining to reconstruct the information that was discarded (you might like to try convincing yourself of this: can you deduce what values must go in the greyed-out nodes in Figure 10, without peeking at any previous figures?). However, in and of itself, this observation does not give us a nice algorithm for computing range sums. It turns out the key is to think about . As we saw in the introduction and the implementation of  in Figure 6, if we can compute the prefix sum  for any , then we can compute the range sum  as . Given a thinned segment tree, the sum of any prefix of the original array (and hence also any range sum) can be computed, in logarithmic time, using only the values of active nodes. Surprisingly, in the special case of prefix queries, the original range query algorithm described in Section 1 and implemented in Figure 7 works unchanged! That is to say, the base case in which the range of the current node is wholly contained within the query range—and we thus return the value of the current node—will only ever happen at active nodes. First, the root itself is active, and hence, querying the full range will work. Next, consider the case where we are at a node and recurse on both children. The left child is always active, so we only need to consider the case where we recurse to the right. It is impossible that the range of the right child will be wholly contained in the query range: since the query range is always a prefix of the form , if the right child’s range is wholly contained in  then the left child’s range must be as well—which means that the parent node’s range (which is the union of its children’s ranges) would also be wholly contained in the query range. But in that case we would simply return the parent’s value without recursing into the right child. Thus, when we do recurse into a right child, we might end up returning 0, or we might recurse further into both grandchildren, but in any case we will never try to look at the value of the right child itself. Figure 11 illustrates performing a prefix query on a segment tree. Notice that visited right children are only ever blue or grey; the only green nodes are left children. Performing a prefix query on a segment tree. How should we actually store a thinned segment tree in memory? If we stare at Figure 10 again, one strategy suggests itself: simply take every active node and “slide” it down and to the right until it lands in an empty slot in the underlying array, as illustrated in Figure 12. This sets up a one-to-one correspondence between active nodes and indices in the range . Another way to understand this indexing scheme is to use a postorder traversal of the tree, skipping over inactive nodes and giving consecutive indices to active nodes encountered during the traversal. We can also visualize the result by drawing the tree in a “right-leaning” style (Figure 13), vertically aligning each active node with the array slot where it is stored. Sliding active values down a thinned segment tree. Right-leaning drawing of a thinned segment tree, vertically aligning nodes with their storage location. This method of storing the active nodes from a thinned segment tree in an array is precisely a . I will also sometimes refer to it as a , when I want to particularly emphasize the underlying array data structure. Although it is certainly a clever use of space, the big question is how to implement the update and range query operations. Our implementations of these operations for segment trees worked by recursively descending through the tree, either directly if the tree is stored as a recursive data structure, or using simple operations on indices if the tree is stored in an array. However, when storing the active nodes of a thinned tree in a Fenwick array, it is not  obvious what operations on array indices will correspond to moving around the tree. In order to attack this problem, we first take a detour through a domain-specific language for two’s complement binary values. The bit tricks usually employed to implement Fenwick trees rely on a  representation of binary numbers, which allow positive and negative numbers to be represented in a uniform way; for example, a value consisting of all 1 bits represents . We therefore turn now to developing a domain-specific language, embedded in Haskell, for manipulating two’s complement binary representations. First, we define a type of bits, with functions for inversion, logical conjunction, and logical disjunction: Next, we must define bit strings, i.e. sequences of bits. Rather than fix a specific bit width, it will be much more elegant to work with  bit strings. It is tempting to use standard Haskell lists to represent potentially infinite bit strings, but this leads to a number of problems. For example, equality of infinite lists is not decidable, and there is no way in general to convert from an infinite list of bits back to an —how would we know when to stop? In fact, these practical problems stem from a more fundamental one: infinite lists of bits are actually a bad representation for two’s complement bit strings, because of “junk”, that is, infinite lists of bits which do not correspond to values in our intended semantic domain. For example,  [,] is an infinite list which alternates between  and  forever, but it does not represent a valid two’s complement encoding of an integer. Even worse are non-periodic lists, such as the one with  at every prime index and  everywhere else. In fact, the bit strings we want are the  ones, that is, strings which eventually settle down to an infinite tail of all zeros (which represent nonnegative integers) or all ones (which represent negative integers). Every such string has a finite representation, so directly encoding eventually constant bit strings in Haskell not only gets rid of the junk but also leads to elegant, terminating algorithms for working with them. represents an infinite sequence of bit , whereas  represents the bit string  followed by a final bit . We use , rather than , to match the way we usually write bit strings, with the least significant bit last. Note also the use of a  on the  field of ; this is to rule out infinite lists of bits using only , such as = () . In other words, the only way to make a non-bottom value of type  is to have a finite sequence of  finally terminated by . Although we have eliminated junk values, one remaining problem is that there can be multiple distinct representations of the same value. For example,  ()  and  both represent the infinite bit string containing all zeros. However, we can solve this with a carefully constructed bidirectional pattern synonym (Pickering ., 2016). Matching with the pattern  uses a  (Erwig & Jones, 2001) to potentially expand a  one step into a , so that we can pretend  values are always constructed with . Conversely, constructing a  with  will do nothing if we happen to snoc an identical bit  onto an existing . This ensures that as long as we stick to using  and never directly use ,  values will always be  so that the terminal  is immediately followed by a different bit. Finally, we mark the pattern  as  on its own, since matching on  is indeed sufficient to handle every possible input of type . However, in order to obtain terminating algorithms we will often include one or more special cases for . Let’s begin with some functions for converting  to and from  and for displaying  (intended only for testing). We can now begin implementing some basic operations on . First, incrementing and decrementing can be implemented recursively as follows: The , or LSB, of a sequence of bits can be defined as follows: Note that we add a special case for  to ensure that  is total. Technically,  does not have a least significant bit, so defining  seems sensible. Bitwise logical conjunction can be defined straightforwardly. Note that we only need two cases; if the finite parts of the inputs have different lengths, matching with  will automatically expand the shorter one to match the longer one. Bitwise inversion is likewise straightforward. The above functions follow familiar patterns. We could easily generalize to eventually constant streams over an arbitrary element type and then implement  in terms of a generic  and  in terms of . However, for the present purpose we do not need the extra generality. We implement addition with the usual carry-propagation algorithm, along with some special cases for . It is not too hard to convince ourselves that this definition of addition is terminating and yields correct results; but we can also be fairly confident by just trying it with QuickCheck: Finally, the following definition of negation is probably familiar to anyone who has studied two’s complement arithmetic; I leave it as an exercise for the interested reader to prove that  for all . We now have the tools to resolve the first mystery of the Fenwick tree implementation. For the last equality, we need a lemma that , which should be intuitively clear and can easily be proved by induction as well. Finally, in order to express the index conversion functions we will develop in the next section, we need a few more things in our DSL. First, some functions to set and clear individual bits and to test whether particular bits are set: The only other things we will need are left and right shift, and a generic  combinator that iterates a given function, returning the first iterate for which a predicate is false. Deriving Fenwick operations We can now finally derive the required operations on Fenwick array indices for moving through the tree, by starting with operations on a binary indexed tree and conjugating by conversion to and from Fenwick indices. First, in order to fuse away the resulting conversion, we will need a few lemmas. (shr-inc-dec). For all  which are odd (that is, end with I), Both are immediate by definition. (while-inc-dec). The following both hold for all Bits values: Easy proof by induction on . For example, for the  case, the functions on both sides discard consecutive 1 bits and then flip the first 0 bit to a 1. Finally, we will need a lemma about shifting zero bits in and out of the right side of a value. Intuitively, this says that if we first shift out all the zero bits and then left shift until bit  is set, we could get the same result by forgetting about the right shifts entirely; shifting out zero bits and then shifting them back in should be the identity. Formally, the proof is by induction on . If  is odd, the equality is immediate since . Otherwise, if , on the left-hand side the  is immediately discarded by , whereas on the right-hand side , and the extra  can be absorbed into the  since . What remains is simply the induction hypothesis. With these lemmas under our belt, let’s see how to move around a Fenwick array in order to implement  and ; we’ll begin with . When implementing the  operation, we need to start at a leaf and follow the path up to the root, updating all the active nodes along the way. In fact, for any given leaf, its closest active parent is precisely the node stored in the slot that used to correspond to that leaf (see Figure 13). So to update index , we just need to start at index  in the Fenwick array, and then repeatedly find the closest active parent, updating as we go. Recall that the imperative code for  works this way, apparently finding the closest active parent at each step by adding the LSB of the current index: Let’s see how to derive this behavior. To find the closest active parent of a node under a binary indexing scheme, we first move up to the immediate parent (by dividing the index by two, i.e. performing a right bit shift); then continue moving up to the next immediate parent as long as the current node is a right child (i.e. has an odd index). This yields the definition: This is why we used the slightly strange indexing scheme with the root having index 2—otherwise this definition would not work for any node whose active parent is the root! Now, to derive the corresponding operation on Fenwick indices, we conjugate by conversion to and from Fenwick indices and compute as follows. To make the computation easier to read, the portion being rewritten is underlined at each step. In the final step, since the input  satisfies , we have , so Lemma 6.3 applies. Reading from right to left, the pipeline we have just computed performs the following steps: 2. Shift out consecutive zeros until finding the least significant 1 bit 4. Shift zeros back in to bring the most significant bit back to position , then clear it. Intuitively, this does look a lot like adding the LSB! In general, to find the LSB, one must shift through consecutive 0 bits until finding the first 1; the question is how to keep track of how many 0 bits were shifted on the way. The  function itself keeps track via the recursion stack; after finding the first 1 bit, the recursion stack unwinds and re-snocs all the 0 bits recursed through on the way. The above pipeline represents an alternative approach: set bit  as a “sentinel” to keep track of how much we have shifted; right shift until the first 1 is literally in the ones place, at which point we increment; and then shift all the 0 bits back in by doing left shifts until the sentinel bit gets back to the  place. One example of this process is illustrated in Figure 19. Of course, this only works for values that are sufficiently small that the sentinel bit will not be disturbed throughout the operation. Adding LSB with a sentinel bit + shifts. To make this more formal, we begin by defining a helper function , which does an operation “at the LSB”, that is, it shifts out 0 bits until finding a 1, applies the given function, then restores the 0 bits. Straightforward induction on . We can formally relate the “shifting with a sentinel” scheme to the use of , with the following (admittedly rather technical) lemma: The proof is rather tedious and not all that illuminating, so we omit it (an extended version including a full proof may be found on the author’s website, at http://ozark.hendrix.edu/ yorgey/pub/Fenwick-ext.pdf). However, we do note that both  and  fit the criteria for : incrementing or decrementing some  cannot affect the st bit as long as , and the result of incrementing or decrementing a number less than  will be a number less than . We can now put all the pieces together show that adding the LSB at each step is the correct way to implement . We can carry out a similar process to derive an implementation for prefix query (which supposedly involves  the LSB). Again, if we want to compute the sum of [1, ], we can start at index  in the Fenwick array, which stores the sum of the unique segment ending at . If the node at index  stores the segment [,], we next need to find the unique node storing a segment that ends at . We can do this repeatedly, adding up segments as we go. Staring at Figure 20 for inspiration, we can see that what we want to do is find the  of our , that is, we go up until finding the first ancestor which is a right child, then go to its left sibling. Under a binary indexing scheme, this can be implemented simply as: Moving up a segment tree to find successive prefix segments. Subtracting the LSB is the correct way to move up a Fenwick-indexed tree to the active node covering the segment previous to the current one, that is,  everywhere on the range . Historically, to my knowledge, Fenwick trees were not actually developed as an optimization of segment trees as presented here. This has merely been a fictional—but hopefully illuminating—alternate history of ideas, highlighting the power of functional thinking, domain-specific languages, and equational reasoning to explore relationships between different structures and algorithms. As future work, it would be interesting to explore some of the mentioned generalizations of segment trees, to see whether one can derive Fenwick-like structures that support additional operations.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A$AP Rocky trial LIVE: Opening statements begin</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBiD8agGi7w</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:23:27 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch live as opening statements begin in A$AP Rocky’s assault trial.

The breach, the largest in U.S. medical history, exposed sensitive data including Social Security numbers, medical records, and financial information. 

UnitedHealth said it has not detected misuse of the stolen data or found medical databases among compromised files. Change Healthcare, a major U.S. healthcare claims processor, paid multiple ransoms after Russian-speaking hackers known as ALPHV breached its systems using stolen credentials lacking multi-factor authentication, according to CEO Andrew Witty's testimony to Congress.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia&apos;s Putin trying to &apos;manipulate&apos; Trump, says Ukraine</title><link>https://www.dw.com/en/russias-putin-trying-to-manipulate-trump-says-ukraine/a-71404340</link><author>/u/Ok-Somewhere9814</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:06:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukraine has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of attempting to "manipulate" new US President Donald Trump in order to bring about an end to the war on his terms and without input from Ukraine or Europe."[Putin] wants to decide Europe's fate without Europe and he seeks to talk about Ukraine without Ukraine," said Andriy Yermak, the head of the Presidential Office in Kyiv, warning that Russia was trying to promote bilateral negotiations with the United States over a war which the Kremlin started.Later, reporting from a briefing with security service chiefs, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of "Putin's readiness to continue the war and manipulate world leaders.""He wants to manipulate the desire of the President of the United States of America to achieve peace," Zelenskyy said during his daily evening address on social media, but added that he was "confident that no Russian manipulations will succeed anymore."Putin: 'We are ready for these negotiations'The comments out of Kyiv came after Putin had signaled earlier on Friday that he was open to discussing an end to his invasion of Ukraine with Trump."It is probably better for us to meet and, based on today's realities, talk calmly about all areas that are of interest to both the US and Russia," he told Russian state television, claiming: "We have always said, and I want to emphasize this once again, that we are ready for these negotiations on Ukrainian issues."Europeans uncertain about Trump role on UkraineDuring his reelection campaign, Trump promised that he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of returning to the White House, boasting of his good relationship with Putin.Speaking to reporters just a few hours after his inauguration on Monday, Trump said he was eager to talk to his Russian counterpart, only to threaten Russia on Wednesday with more "taxes, tariffs and sanctions" if Putin did not end his "ridiculous war" soon.Praising Trump as a "smart" and "pragmatic" leader, he said: "I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president – if his victory hadn't been stolen in 2020  then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that emerged in 2022."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Domino Effects: Insurance after LA fires, immigration enforcement, sober spirits | Wall Street Week</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS4kEYo0214</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2025 00:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we look at the future of insurance in Los Angeles after devastating wildfires, President Trump's economic argument for immigration enforcement, and the growing trend of non-alcoholic beer and spirits.

Nothing but NATS - Going Beyond Cloud Native - Byron Ruth & Kevin Hoffman, Synadia

These days building so-called cloud-native apps involves assembling a custom stack of tools 10x bigger than the app we're building. Additionally, applications increasingly need to expand out to the edge and cloud-native stacks simply don't work in those environments. Fortunately with NATS, we don't need a stack. In this session you'll see how we can leverage compute, storage, and connectivity to build cloud-to-edge native apps more powerful than ever, with less code, effort, and frustration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who is Friedrich Merz, Germany&apos;s likely next leader? | Berlin Briefing Podcast</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKXAJbIqzfs</link><author>DW News</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 23:30:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[John Kampfner, Journalist and Author:
He's a man who, as you say, he's been in politics for a long time. He's acerbic. He doesn't suffer fools gladly. He's capable of being quite rude to people. He knows his mind. Both because of his relationship to Angela Merkel and feeling that she had stabbed him in the front and the back, and is very keen to do the same now to her during this election campaign and afterwards. He has committed what, for some traditional Germans think is a cardinal sin and worked in the private sector for the asset company Blackrock and sort of a big global company, which in the sort of millennial feeling of Germany's centre-left, is regarded as beyond the pale.

Instead, he defines them as "collectibles." From a report: "It's like a baseball card or a stamp," Sacks said in an interview with Fox Business on Thursday, referencing Trump's explosively popular memecoin. "People buy it because they want to commemorate something." 

The famous venture capitalist's comments touched on a long-running debate about the crypto industry in general: how exactly to treat different digital assets. Some argue that digital assets are securities, which are tradable financial assets like stocks. But others say they're commodities, or raw materials that can be bought and sold, like gold and wheat. The classification differences have vast regulatory implications. "There's a few different categories here, so defining the market structure is important," said Sacks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Retro Biosciences, backed by Sam Altman, is raising $1 billion to extend human lifespan</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/retro-biosciences-backed-by-sam-altman-is-raising-1-billion-to-extend-human-lifespan/</link><author>Charles Rollet</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 23:24:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sam Altman-backed Retro Biosciences is raising $1 billion to develop drugs that extend human lifespan by 10 years, the FT reports.© 2024 TechCrunch.

Vorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple's artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She'll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn't been announced publicly. The move helps bolster a team that's racing to make Apple a leader in AI -- an area where it's fallen behind technology peers. [...]
 
Vorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She's also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple's hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset. Over the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple's biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset's operating system, according to the people.
 
Prior to joining Giannandrea's organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group's previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath -- as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers. The move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said. It has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple's product development culture to the AI work, the person said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump and JD Vance show support for demonstrators at March for Life rally</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwWFmFheqQ4</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:49:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump vowed to support anti-abortion-rights protesters in his second term as tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied in Washington on Friday for the annual March for Life.

Why does it seem like every startup is antsy to gobble up your helpful services, but the large C-level corporate heads couldn't care less about you? Do not be discouraged, my friend. Industry professionals who have "been there, done that" have a few suggestions to help you and your business break into this lucrative market.We asked our industry experts two questions…: Who do I want to talk to? a) President/Owner b) Vice-President of Marketing c) Or do I want to talk to multiple people?\
: With large corporate organizations, the chances are higher that decisions will be made bureaucratically. You will need to talk with multiple people and build value in your product based on their perspectives of their organization's needs. In medium-to-small organizations, it's more likely that one person can make unilateral decisions. It was recommended that I do not call up and ask for the "decision-maker" - this just screams, "I'm a salesperson!" The key with higher-level execs of large companies is to NOT get past the gatekeeper but get the gatekeeper to introduce you." So make friends with the administrative assistant.: What's the best way to talk to the decision-maker? a) Calling the corporate office b) Using social media or LinkedIn? c) Finding their phone extension or email on the corporate website?\
: Actually, all of the above were recommended for various steps in the process. Tools like Google, LinkedIn, and social media are great for finding out who the decision-maker is. In more progressive or entrepreneurial organizations, chances are better that the management team is willing to talk to  like you through social media. It was recommended that I create awareness about myself and my company/product/service first by either a personal phone call or a brief email customized to the person I am trying to influence. The phone call or personalized email should separate my sales solicitation from spam.: A few things to note about this email: it's brief, it's customized to the recipient, and the features of what I'm selling are quantifiable. The chances of getting a reply to this email are pretty high…Hi Chris,As the CEO of a property management company, I can imagine you are constantly looking for ways to maximize the efficiency of your organization. I'm the business development officer of a company specializing in property management software solutions. Our proprietary software has on average saved firms like yours 20 man-hours a week by automating property management tasks. In addition to saving firms like yours over 50% on their tenant background checking using our 30-minute online qualification process.Please check out a 5-minute demo here on our website for more details. I will follow up with a phone call to your office tomorrow morning.Best Regards,JonathanI've been doing cold email outreach for MarketplaceGOLD, my cryptocurrency geo-directory; I add crypto-friendly businesses to my website and send them a simple email from my Gmail address:\
  I've added you to my cryptocurrency directory, MarketplaceGOLD.com, here[link]Which cryptos do you accept there? You'll notice a "Claim" button on the listing, you can register on my website and you'll be able to make any changes you want to the listing.Cold-Calling Phone Script for Getting Through the GatekeeperIn my experience, you can usually find out who the decision-maker is in about 60 seconds using Google or quickly browsing through the company's website. (admin assistant's name), how are you today? I'm Jonathan Roseland and I'm calling in regard to marketing. Is the person in charge of that type of thing at your office?\
If you know the name of the decision-maker: (admin assistant's name), how are you today? I'm Jonathan Roseland; I'm calling for Dave Johnson (the decision-maker's name). \
I find that when dealing with small to mid-sized companies, this line works great because the directness and use of my last name subtly indicate that the decision-maker . It's important to deliver it with a confident intonation. A lot of the time, they will connect you right to the decision-maker.Hello Dave, this is Jonathan Roseland, my number is XXX-XXX-XXXX, please give me a call back at your convenience.\
This voicemail message will get you a call back 50%-70% of the time compared with 10%-20% of the callbacks you get when you describe your product. While some might consider it slightly misleading since I'm not telling them what my call is about, I've used this message for years, and I can't think of a time when my prospect was mad or felt misled when they called back."C-level executives don't actually care what you sell. They care about their businesses. There is nothing about your business you can tell them that is of interest," says Tiffany Lyman Otten, a Senior Account Executive with PAETEC. She recommends introducing yourself as quickly as possible, then launching into how you can address a problem they may be facing with their business. \
Be prepared to give specifics as to how you've helped others and boosted net profits for a comparable business. Eliminate excess words in your proposal and give executives the room to respond. Most importantly, Tiffany reminds us, "You need to be thinking with every word out of your mouth "Why should I care?" because you have all of about 5 seconds to answer that question if you want to get another 5 seconds."Survival, Cash Flow, and ProfitabilityTo take it one step further, Gary McLean, a Sales Representative with Royal LePage Real Estate, reminds B2B marketers: "C Level managers are concerned with survival, cash flow, and profitability - usually in that order. It doesn't matter what you are selling. If you address these three areas, you will hold their rapt attention for as long as you want it." It's important to craft your entire presentation around these important areas. \n Remember, when working with larger corporate entities, part of your success depends upon getting through the gatekeepers to the real decision-makers. "Treat these gatekeepers with respect, ask for their help, and position what you want in very straightforward language. What you want is "to see if my services may provide value for your organization," advises Shawn Greene, a Sales Performance Expert at Savage & Greene. \
She adds, "Since you will not succeed with the 'decision-maker,' learn to say something more like, 'Who would you suggest I talk to about that?'" Few things are more important than research when you're dealing with big corporations, so be sure you're clear on how your business can address their wants, needs, and interests.If you want to take your sales game to the next level, here are a couple of sales psychology books that will ROI like buying Bitcoin in 2015…]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Coding Is Based on a Faulty Premise</title><link>https://articles.pragdave.me/p/ai-coding-is-based-on-a-faulty-premise?r=2rvraz</link><author>/u/ThatArrowsmith</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:38:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am glad to  be living in a time where AI is becoming mainstream. When I write code, I often use AI to complete code and to lookup the way libraries and tools can be used.At the same time, I am increasingly distressed by the race to replace human developers, particularly the more junior ones, with AI assistants.There is good reason to believe that this is a regressive trend, even in the short-to-medium term. That reason is linked to the history of software development, the software crisis of 1990s, and the movement towards a more agile style of development. two conferencesDuring the 1970s, academics (and some larger companies) tried to refine what this phrase meant. There was clearly a large chasm between what a customer wanted and the delivery of software to satisfy them. So software engineering came to mean a process of narrowing the gap by dividing it into lots of phases, where the conceptual gap between each phase was smaller (and therefore more tractable) than a single large gap.Managing the Development of Large Software SystemsIt shows the way many people felt that software should be developed; a set of steps, where the output of each is a refinement of its input. Each step would produce an increasing amount of specification, until finally we reached coding, testing, and delivery.This diagram defined a generation of software development practices. Unfortunately, its advocates didn’t bother to read the paper past this nice simple picture. Royce points out that each step is likely to find errors in the preceding step, and so the diagram should look like this:Then he points out that the reality is likely to be more anarchic. Errors found towards the end of the process may well have been caused by problems many steps back.His solution to this was regrettable: increase the level of detail of the specifications passed between steps. By a lot. Fortunately, because no one bothered to read the whole paper, we were spared that additional process insult.Chaos ReportIn retrospect, the reason was pretty damn obvious:telephoneTeams in the 1990s knew intuitively that this kind of snowballing cascade of small errors was unsustainable, so they subverted the project development structures imposed on them. They chose to ignore things that were patently incorrect. They talked to each other, and adjusted what they did in order to produce bits of code that would actually work together. And they got better and better at padding estimates.The Manifesto for Agile Software Development, created in 2001, explicitly acknowledged that specifications at all levels were suspect, and that the only true measure of a project is the value it produces. It insisted that people should be in the loop, applying their intuition and skill to take small steps, and then using feedback to asses how successful they’d been. Each step was like a mini-waterfall, tacitly running from requirements to tests in a matter on minutes, often publishing code to the end users many times a day.(I’m resisting the temptation here to rant about the current state of “agile.” That’ll be another article.)But that’s not what I’m seeing. Companies are jumping on AI as a way of removing those messy (and expensive) humans from the process of developing software.Right now (early 2025), we’re starting see a move from AI as coding assistant to AI as program writer. Nonprogrammers are working with Claude and ChatGPT to create simple programs. Companies are experimenting more and more with content produced largely by AI. And the problem with that is the same as the problem with the poorly-applied waterfall approach: people don’t know what they want. They’ll ask AI for a solution to their perceived need, and then run what they are given, often without understanding what it does. This applies equally to end users and (amazingly) to developers.So the AI produces code based on at best a partial and at worst an inaccurate description, and then that code becomes part of a larger system, integrating with other chunks of imaginary code.That’s OK, people say. We’ll have the AI write tests, too.Don’t get me wrong. AI is a world-changing tool.But good software developers have already changed the world beyond recognition. And they’ve done that by taking uncertain, inaccurate ideas and using their experience, intuition, and communications skills to hone them into something that changes people’s lives.Remove these people from the equation, and will be back in the 1990s, in a world full of poor software and unmet needs.Or am I just being a Luddite? Let’s discuss below.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;Canada is Not for Sale&apos; hat goes viral after Trump threats | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs1RWQqLpfo</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:31:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A hat reading ‘Canada is Not for Sale’ has gone viral after US President Donald Trump threatened tariffs and suggested Canada become the 51st state.

Despite an inheritance tax, wealth continues to grow untaxed for the ultra-wealthy. How is that possible? 

Ahead of the elections in Germany, most political parties overall promise tax relief in their election manifestos. While the Greens, SPD and BSW propose reforms to the inheritance tax aimed at generating an additional €3 billion annually, other parties advocate for reductions. The AfD's proposal could even slash annual inheritance tax revenue in Germany by as much as €10 billion. These policies could widen the gap between the rich and the poor.

It’s a faster and lighter alternative for headless operations without any graphical rendering.Why start over? We’ve worked a lot with Chrome headless at our previous company, scraping millions of web pages per day. While it’s powerful, it’s also heavy on CPU and memory usage. For scraping at scale, building AI agents, or automating websites, the overheads are high. So we asked ourselves: what if we built a browser that only did what’s absolutely necessary for headless automation?Our browser is made of the following main components:- an HTML parser and DOM tree (based on Netsurf libs)- a Javascript runtime (v8)- partial web APIs support (currently DOM and XHR/Fetch)- and a CDP (Chrome Debug Protocol) server to allow plug & play connection with existing scripts (Puppeteer, Playwright, etc).The main idea is to avoid any graphical rendering and just work with data manipulation, which in our experience covers a wide range of headless use cases (excluding some, like screenshot generation).In our current test case Lightpanda is roughly 10x faster than Chrome headless while using 10x less memory.It's a work in progress, there are hundreds of Web APIs, and for now we just support some of them. It's a beta version, so expect most websites to fail or crash. The plan is to increase coverage over time.We chose Zig for its seamless integration with C libs and its  feature that allow us to generate bi-directional Native to JS APIs (see our zig-js-runtime lib https://github.com/lightpanda-io/zig-js-runtime). And of course for its performance :)As a company, our business model is based on a Managed Cloud, browser as a service. Currently, this is primarily powered by Chrome, but as we integrate more web APIs it will gradually transition to Lightpanda.We would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Where should we focus our efforts next to support your use cases?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Onit – open-source ChatGPT Desktop with local mode, Claude, Gemini</title><link>https://github.com/synth-inc/onit</link><author>telenardo</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:15:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey Hackernews- it’s Tim Lenardo and I’m launching v1 of Onit today!Onit is ChatGPT Desktop, but with local mode and support for other model providers (Anthropic, GoogleAI, etc). It's also like Cursor Chat, but everywhere on your computer - not just in your IDE!Onit is open-source! You can download a pre-built version from our website: 
www.getonit.aiWe built this because we believe:
Universal Access: AI assistants should be accessible from anywhere on my computer, not just in the browser or in specific apps
Provider Freedom: Consumers should have the choice between providers (anthropic, openAI, etc.) not be locked into a single one (ChatGPT desktop only has OpenAI models)
Local first: AI is more useful with access to your data. But that doesn't count for much if you have to upload personal files to an untrusted server. Onit will always provide options for local processing. No personal data leaves your computer without approval
Customizability: Onit is your assistant. You should be able to configure it to your liking
Extensibility: Onit should allow the community to build and share extensions, making it more useful for everyone.The features for V1 include:
 Local mode - chat with any model running locally on Ollama! No internet connection required
 Multi-provider support - Top models for OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and GoogleAI
 File upload - add images or files for context (bonus: Drag & drop works too!)
 History - revisit prior chats through the history view or with a simple up/down arrow shortcut
 Customizable Shortcut - you pick your hotkey to launch the chat window. (Command+zero by default)What data are you collecting?
Onit V1 does not have a server. Local requests are handled locally, and remote requests are sent to model providers directly from the client. We collect crash reports through Firebase and a single "chat sent" event through PostHog analytics. We don't store your prompts or responses.How to does Onit support local mode? 
For use local mode, run Ollama. You can get Ollama here: https://ollama.com/ 
Onit gets a list of your local models through Ollama’s API.Which models do you support? 
For remote models, Onit V1 supports Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI and GoogleAI. Default models include (o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o, Claude3.5 Sonnet, Claude3.5 Haiku, Gemini 2.0, Grok 2, Grok 2 Vision).
For local mode, Onit supports any models you can run locally on Ollama!What license is Onit under? 
We’re releasing V1 available on a Creative Commons Non-Commercial license. We believe the transparency of open-source is critical. We also want to make sure individuals can customize Onit to their needs (please submit PRs!). However, we don’t want people to sell the code as their own.Where is the monetization?
We’re not monetizing V1. In the future we may add paid premium features. Local chat will- of course- always remain free. If you disagree with a monetized feature, you can always build from source!Why not Linux or Windows? 
Gotta start somewhere! If the reception is positive, we’ll work hard to add further support.Who are we? 
We are Synth, Inc, a small team of developers in San Francisco building at the frontier of AI progress. Other projects include Checkbin (www.checkbin.dev) and Alias (deprecated - www.alias.inc).We’d love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out at contact@getonit dot ai.Future roadmap includes:
 Autocontext - automatically pull context from computer, rather than having to repeatedly upload. 
 Local-RAG - let users index and create context from their files without uploading anything. 
 Local-typeahead - i.e. Cursor Tab but for everywhere
 Additional support - add Linux/Windows, Mistral/Deepseek etc etc.
 (maybe) Bundle Ollama to avoid double-download
 And lot’s more!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who is the guy handing Trump those binders of executive orders?

How can we make the recurring topic relevant without more SCREAMS about "dupe"? I do have a bit of recent research I could share -- quite a bit of fresh data since my latest search started a couple of months ago. Or perhaps I could start with a summary of the useful bits from an ancient Ask Slashdot discussion about batteries?
 
Seems funny to ask about relevant books, even though two come to mind already. One is The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt, where he argues that smartphone use by preadolescents is destroying their personalities. The other is Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who doesn't actually say much about them, but I still think they should have been included in the the big table of examples at the end of the prologue. The "system" of smartphones is antifragile, even though the earliest models were quite fragile. The essence of this question is about which current smartphone models are the most robust...
 
Maybe I should include a list of my own criteria so far? However, would would just be responses to the problems with my current Samsung Galaxy and the Oppo I had before that. I've already determined that the two main problems with those models don't exist with any of the current options offered by my phone company... And the ancient battery problems are still lurking, too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Simple Diagram That Will Change How You See Space and Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT1QSi8y56k</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 22:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Third Episode in our series on the Theory of Everything, we're exploring the simultaneity of your past, present and future.

After using Vim/Neovim for more than 15
years, I recently decided to try out something new. I don't know if this little
experiment will work, or if I'll run back to my trusty Neovim, but hey, what I do know
is that I'd like to find out.Why though? If you've used a specific tool for that long, why (try to) switch to
something else anyway? Everyone has their own reasons. I have two.1. The desire to use something that just worksLately, I've been drifting towards things that "just work".I love (Neo)Vim. Like I wrote earlier, it's been my primary editor for the past 15
years. What I don't love is all the configuration that goes into it before I can use it
to start writing code.When I first started using Vim (in 2009!), my configuration was a tiny  file
that was handed over to me by my internship supervisor at that time. I had no idea what
it did, but it worked. Over time, as I felt the need to customize things, my 
started accumulating increasingly more code copied from StackOverflow that I didn't
understand.At some point Neovim came out, and with it, the ability to configure things using Lua.
This was a huge step up, because I could at least understand what I was configuring.Either way, it's still configuration. What changed was just  that configuration was
done. The combination of configuring the base editor and installing a set of plugins
(and making sure that they play nice with each other) isn't really something that I
would like to spend my time on, going forward.One recent example that highlights this problem: my workflow consists of switching
back and forth between a terminal window and an editor window. At any time, I have
multiple projects open in both. On macOS, it's been difficult to find a solution that
"just works". The most popular Neovim GUI clients on macOS include Vimr and Neovide,
which are both excellent projects. Neovide though, does not support multiple windows,
which is integral to my workflow and hence requires me to implement workarounds, which
actually broke last week after I ran . And while Vimr does support
multiple windows, it is not able to render icons in nvim-tree, which is less than
ideal. 🤷🏻‍♂️2. Deeper and native LLM integrationLLMs are happening, whether we like it or not. And no, the fact that they aren't 100%
correct all the time is not a reason to discard them entirely. I understand why some
people don't want to use them. And I respect that. I personally find them useful and
would like to integrate them more into my daily workflow.The Neovim ecosystem has a bunch of plugins for using LLMs. But as I wrote in the
previous section, I'd like to avoid plugins when possible. Installing plugins means
updating them, which inevitably breaks things.One example where I find LLMs useful when coding is handling boilerplate stuff. In my
current Neovim setup, I have the the Codeium extension installed, which offers code
suggestions that are like an autocomplete on steroids. Often, I can write a function
name and what parameters it's expecting, and the LLM writes out the function for me.
This is particularly helpful when writing small functions or test cases.I'd like to be able to do more of such things in my editor. I'm not entirely sold on the
idea of agentic editors, as I'd like to keep at least  agency over the code that's
going in, but that's a different topic.Another example of where I find LLMs useful: I'm not a native English speaker and often
struggle to find the right sentence framing that is both concise and catchy. LLMs are
excellent at this! I can scribble my initial thoughts, throw it at an LLM and ask it to
reframe the whole thing, which is great!Generally, it feels like the way we're writing code is changing with the introduction of
this extremely powerful tool, and I'd like to move with the times.So yeah, those are the two reasons why I've been looking to try out something else
lately. What made me go for Zed?Yep, that's literally the first reason. After using Vim for 15 years, my fingers have
built up enough muscle memory that not using Vim keybindings when writing code is
downright impossible.Zed's Vim mode is surprisingly solid! So far, I feel right at home. Almost all Vim
keybindings that I'm used to work just as expected. The one or two bindings that don't
work, are something that I can make my peace with and retrain my fingers on. Everything
else works excellent. It also looks like they're doubling down on their Vim mode
support in 2025, which is a great sign!When you fire up Zed, the editor is fully functional without having to write a single
line of configuration. That's awesome. The editor may prompt you every now and then to
install support for specific languages. But that's usually just one button click.Lua is great, but one JSON file is even better. Zed uses JSON as the configuration
syntax and so far it feels a lot simpler than what I've worked with so far.I had no idea I needed this until I had it!While editing the Zed configuration file, I found it really helpful how the editor
suggests configuration keys and their potential values. This feature felt really
thoughtful when I first saw it and I could imagine that it goes a long way in getting
new users up to speed quicker.5. Native LLM integrationI know some people have been turned off by this, but I actually like this feature.Zed has a feature called Assistant, which is a tool to, well, assist you, using a large
language model of your choice. A few popular LLM providers are supported. Once set up,
you can open up the Assistant panel to work together with the language model you've
chosen. For instance, it's pretty easy to type in questions in the panel window and then
paste text from your open file buffers into it to give the LLM more context. There's a
lot more to this feature that I haven't used yet, but I'll probably get to it the more I
use it.Overall, the integration feels very native and very useful.Last but definitely not the least is speed! Zed is  fast. Everything feels very
snappy, and it's clear that the team has put a lot of effort into making everything
fast.It's only been a day since I really started using Zed instead of Neovim as my daily
driver. And so far the experience has been quite nice.Like I wrote earlier, this is an experiment. We'll see how things turn out. That being
said though, the first impression looks  good.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>&apos;Utter bulls***&apos; — Ukraine rejects Russia&apos;s demand to abandon NATO membership promise</title><link>https://kyivindependent.com/utter-bul-it-ukraine-rejects-russias-demand-to-abandon-nato-membership-promise/</link><author>/u/Yveliad</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 21:44:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukraine's Foreign Ministry dismissed Russia's demand to cancel NATO's 2008 promise of eventual membership for Ukraine, calling it "utter bul***it" in a Jan. 24 statement.The response comes after Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko criticized NATO's 2008 Bucharest Summit declaration, calling it "catastrophic for European security.""Aw shucks, North Korea's ally issuing ultimatums to NATO. Utter bul***it," said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi in response to Grushko's remarks. "Moscow has no say here."Instead, the ministry praised NATO's decision at the time and reiterated Kyiv's commitment to joining the alliance."European security architecture is built on protection from Russia," Tykhyi said.Ukraine officially applied to join NATO in September 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion. While NATO members pledged at the 2024 Washington Summit that Ukraine's path to membership is "irreversible," they have yet to extend a formal invitation.Russian officials, as well as Western intellectuals with a track record of anti-Ukraine narratives have repeatedly cited Ukraine's potential NATO membership as a justification for the invasion. President Volodymyr Zelensky has acknowledged opposition from several NATO members, including the U.S., Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia, but expressed hope that U.S. President Donald Trump could sway support for Kyiv's entry.There is little evidence that the new administration would be more open to Ukraine's NATO membership than former U.S. President Joe Biden.Trump has previously criticized NATO and blamed Biden for allegedly supporting Ukraine's aspirations and provoking Russia's invasion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stocks Finish Broadly Lower | Closing Bell</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnKVgW9TjKE</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 21:37:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Romaine Bostick, Alix Steel, Scarlet Fu, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec.

If he succeeds, he’ll face huge challenges: restoring economic growth after two years of recession, and delivering political stability after the infighting of the outgoing coalition. Experts warn that the stakes for a Merz-led government will be high: failure to deliver could fuel the far right. In this edition of Berlin Briefing, DW’s Richard Walker and Michaela Küfner break it all down with writer John Kampfner. Who is Friedrich Merz? Why did he have a feud with Angela Merkel? How would he deal with Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, the Ukraine war and the challenge of China? And can he deliver the reboot that he says Germany needs?

In modern organizations, visualization isn’t just a tool for analysis - it's a key method of communication that bridges the gap between data experts and decision-makers. Effective visualizations don’t just make data look appealing; they transform raw data into actionable insights that allow decision-makers to make better, faster, and more informed choices. By turning data into stories, visualization helps communicate insights that drive strategy, improve efficiency, and create a shared understanding across teams.Why Does Data Visualization Matter?: Visuals reduce cognitive load by allowing users to absorb complex information quickly, turning abstract data into meaningful insights. Humans process visual information faster than text or numbers. While the often-cited figure that we process visuals 60,000x faster than words is unsubstantiated, it’s true that well-designed visualizations enable quicker decision-making by tapping into our natural ability to process visual information rapidly.: By highlighting trends, anomalies, and outliers, visualizations provide critical context for decision-makers. This context enables them to spot potential issues or opportunities they might otherwise miss, turning data into actionable insight that drives results.Data-Driven Communication: Data visualization acts as a universal language, ensuring that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can access the same insights and participate in the decision-making process. This democratization of data allows for more inclusive, informed conversations across all levels of an organization.: In long-term planning, visualizations help reveal patterns and trends in historical data that can inform future strategies. They offer an overview of complex processes, helping businesses identify areas for improvement, innovation, and resource allocation. These insights often inform key strategic initiatives such as market expansion, product development, or operational efficiency.Key Consideration #1: Tailoring Visualizations to StakeholdersOne of the key components in  in organizational data visualization is tailoring the outputs to the specific needs of various stakeholders:: Executives require high-level, strategic overviews focused on key business metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, and overall efficiency. These visualizations prioritize simplicity, allowing decision-makers to see trends and red flags at a glance. Interactive dashboards that summarize performance across functions or regions and highlight progress toward key strategic objectives are particularly useful. Executives benefit from being able to drill into certain metrics, but only when relevant to assessing high-level performance.: Directors and senior managers need visualizations that bridge strategic goals with operational realities, often focused on department-level performance metrics or specific project KPIs. For example, they might monitor product performance, regional sales trends, or customer satisfaction across segments. Interactive dashboards that offer drill-downs into finer details, such as performance by region or product line, help senior managers identify trends and operationalize strategic objectives.: Mid-level managers are responsible for translating strategy into daily operations, so they benefit from dashboards with a higher level of granularity. Their visualizations often emphasize team or process-specific metrics, enabling them to track efficiency, productivity, and immediate goals. For example, a sales manager might track performance by team member, while a production manager might view metrics on manufacturing speed and quality. Real-time updates and the ability to filter data by category (e.g., team, process) allow them to address challenges promptly.Team Leads and Supervisors: Supervisors and team leads rely on detailed, real-time visualizations to manage individual and team-level performance. Dashboards that provide metrics on task completion rates, output quality, and short-term targets are essential for making immediate adjustments and supporting team members. In customer service, for instance, a supervisor might track average response time and resolution rates in real time, enabling quick responses to issues as they arise.: For employees who directly interact with customers, produce goods, or handle core tasks, visualizations should be accessible and task-oriented. Simple, real-time metrics, such as individual productivity rates or customer satisfaction scores, help frontline staff understand their impact and align their actions with broader objectives. For example, a customer support agent might see daily feedback scores, while a factory worker might monitor real-time production counts against targets.\
By tailoring visualizations to the requirements of each organizational level, companies can enhance alignment, enable decision-making, and ensure that insights support both strategic and operational goals across the hierarchy. It cannot be overstated that the value delivered by a report or dashboard is directly related to its ability to enable the target audience to take action. A generic set of numbers that requires further interpretation by the audience will engender poor engagement – a waste of the developer’s time and a missed opportunity for delivering business value.Key Consideration #2: Make Good Design ChoicesData Visualization is often about delivering an accurate narrative such that the message received by the audience is not misleading, ambiguous, or , worse, incorrect. Having considered the needs of your audience, the following best practices apply:\
Simplicity Over Complexity: one of the core principles of good visualization is . The purpose of a visual is to distill complex data into a format that is easy to interpret, without overwhelming the viewer. Avoid clutter by eliminating unnecessary elements like decorative graphics or excessive labeling that distract from the core message. When designing a visualization, always ask: does this element help communicate the data more clearly, or does it add confusion?: Use clean, minimalist designs that focus on the data itself, rather than excessive styling or effects. Less is often more when it comes to making data understandable.: Attempting to ‘be all things to all people’ usually results in the creation of something too complicated that serves no audience well.\
Choosing the Right Visualization: different types of data require different types of visuals. A pie chart, for instance, is best for showing proportions, while a line graph is ideal for displaying trends over time. Choosing the wrong type of visualization can lead to misinterpretation or a lack of clarity.: Match the visualization to the nature of the data:: Compare quantities across categories.: Show trends over time.: Illustrate relationships or correlations between variables.: Highlight intensity or frequency within datasets. Using a combination chart in an attempt to compare two dimensions can result in neither being easy to read. Two well-calibrated charts can be more effective than one.\
 color can be a powerful tool for emphasizing important data points or drawing attention to key insights. However, improper use of color can also be misleading or create visual confusion. Always use color with purpose, ensuring that it aligns with the data you want to emphasize and remains accessible to all audiences, including those who are colorblind.: Limit your color palette to a few key colors. Use contrasting colors to highlight important points but avoid overloading the visualization with too many hues. Ensure that your visualizations are  by using color combinations that can be distinguished by all viewers. Your organization may have color guidelines or established standards for indicating good or poor performance. Adopt these to enable readers to more easily interpret performance from one report to the next.: Avoid ‘trendy’ uses of color and style (black backgrounds, 3d columns, etc.) where these differ from organizational standards as these present a further barrier to stakeholders who are already intimidated by data and dashboards.\
Avoiding Misleading Visuals: it’s easy to unintentionally mislead viewers with data visualizations, especially when visual elements are exaggerated or out of proportion. Manipulating scales, axes, or proportions can make trends seem more significant than they are, leading to incorrect conclusions.: Always ensure that axes are appropriately scaled, and proportions are represented accurately. Avoid truncating axes unless necessary, and clearly label any anomalies in the data.: It can be tempting to adjust visualizations so that they show  rather than nothing. However, context is everything when interpreting performance and a small dip in quarterly revenue when annual performance is on track should not become a distraction for an audience who likely has many operational concerns and will welcome a set of indicators that report ‘do not worry about this at the moment’.\
 a well-designed visualization should be understandable at a glance, but it also needs context to convey its full meaning. This includes clear and concise labels, legends, and titles that explain what the data represents and why it matters. Proper labeling is essential for guiding the viewer through the visual, helping them understand the relationships between different data points.: Include a descriptive title that summarizes the key takeaway of the chart and ensure all axes and data points are clearly labelled.: The use of too many labels crowds out the value of those that tell the story of the visual as in  above.\
 when visualizing data, it’s important to remain transparent and ethical. This means presenting the data honestly, without manipulating or distorting it to suit a particular narrative. Ethical visualization also involves being mindful of privacy concerns, especially when visualizing sensitive data.: Prioritize data anonymization when visualizing sensitive information to protect individual privacy. Transparency about data sources, limitations, and the purpose of the visualization helps build trust and mitigates ethical risks.: A common oversight is not anonymizing personal data or grouping data in a way that could unintentionally expose vulnerable populations.\
 good design includes making your visualizations accessible to as many people as possible. This means ensuring that charts and graphs can be easily understood by viewers with disabilities, such as those with colorblindness or visual impairments. Incorporating accessible design principles is not only inclusive but also enhances clarity for all viewers.: Use high-contrast color schemes and avoid relying solely on color to distinguish between categories.

Building on TONX’s success in the API and security space, KTON is positioned to capture the $6.12 billion TON liquid staking market opportunity.\
KTON allows users to stake TON while receiving $KTON, unlocking liquidity without sacrificing staking rewards. Unlike existing solutions that often concentrate risk or lack robust standardization, KTON provides institutional-grade security tailored for family offices, trusts, and exchanges. Users can start staking with as little as 1 TON, and there is no lock-up period.Unlocking TON's $6.12B Liquid Staking Market PotentialLiquid staking has transformed blockchain ecosystems with Lido Finance dominating Ethereum's LST market at $30B TVL. KTON aims to capture similar potential in TON's nascent LST market, currently valued at $377M.“Our research reveals TON's LST ratio matches Solana at 10% of staked tokens, yet TON's total staking rate is merely 13.7% versus Solana's 69%, indicating a 5x growth potential. Furthermore, if TON's LST ratio reaches Ethereum's 36%, the market could surge 18X, unlocking an additional $6.12B in value,” said Dr. Awesome Doge, founder of TONX and KTON.“KTON aims to bridge this gap by providing the infrastructure needed to unlock this liquidity and drive TON’s DeFi expansion.”\
KTON's staking service will unlock liquidity, enabling seamless integration with leading TON native DEXs and protocols, and more DeFi giants which are entering TON like Ethena and Curve Finance. This offers TON users flexible and stable yield strategies through various DeFi opportunities while maintaining staking rewards."TONX's triumph is a powerful testament to why KTON has solidified its place as a trusted pillar in the ecosystem," said Howard Peng of TON Ventures.TONXKTON Sets New Standards for TON Liquid Staking InfrastructureKTON is addressing the critical challenges of existing liquid staking solutions, such as concentration risks and lack of standardization, by introducing a decentralized protocol with institutional-grade security.\

Clary</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 21:19:24 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Every entrepreneur dreams of mastery. Of reaching that point where decisions feel easy, where success feels certain, where expertise eliminates doubt.\
But there's a hidden cost to deep expertise that nobody talks about – one that becomes more apparent the more successful you become.\
The more you learn about building companies, the  decisions get. The more you understand your market, the  certain you feel.\
And counterintuitively, this growing uncertainty isn't a sign that you're doing something wrong. It's evidence that you're evolving into the kind of operator who builds lasting companies.\
Because most people think expertise brings clarity.\
Last month, I sat with three founders at a private dinner in Miami. Combined valuation? Over $3 billion. But they weren't talking about their successes. Instead, they were sharing something more interesting: how much more uncertain they feel now than when they started.\
One of them said something that stopped me cold:\
"The more I learn about building companies, the less confident I am about every decision. Five years ago, I thought I knew everything. Now? I see a thousand ways each choice could go wrong."\
The Hidden Pattern in High Performance\
This isn't just about founders. This pattern shows up everywhere once you start looking for it:The senior engineer who takes longer to ship code because they can see all the edge cases.The experienced investor who feels less certain about deals because they've seen how many ways things can fail.The veteran CEO who spends more time on decisions because they understand the ripple effects.\
But here's what makes this fascinating: This increasing uncertainty isn't a bug in your development. It's a feature of true expertise.\
Think about your own journey:Remember when decisions felt simple?When solutions seemed obvious?When you could make choices quickly without seeing all the complexities?\
That wasn't because you were better then. It was because you were blind to what you didn't know.Let me show you why this happens at a fundamental level.\
Every level of expertise you gain doesn't just add new knowledge – it  the variables you can see. The interactions you can spot.\
The complexity you can comprehend.\
Here's how it breaks down:Considers 10-15 interactionsFeels confident because the scope seems manageable\
Considers 50-100 interactionsStarts feeling the weight of complexityMust consider 1000+ potential interactionsUnderstands the true scope of uncertainty\
But here's where it gets really interesting…\
As you gain true expertise, your brain develops two capabilities at different rates:Your ability to solve problemsYour ability to  problems\
The second one? It grows faster. At 2 years in: You can spot 100 potential issues but solve 80At 5 years in: You can spot 500 issues but solve 300At 10 years in: You can spot 1000+ issues but solve 600\
This creates what I call the "Expert's Burden" – your awareness of complexity grows faster than your ability to handle it.Here's what makes this especially brutal for high performers:\
Your success depends on decisive action, but your expertise reveals exactly why everything could go wrong. The more you learn, the heavier each decision becomes.\
Think about what happens as you gain true expertise. At first, you operate with what I call "beginner's confidence" - that beautiful state where decisions feel clear because you can't see their complexity. Your ignorance becomes your superpower. You move fast precisely because you don't know what could break.\
As your knowledge deepens, you start seeing systems instead of isolated decisions. Every choice reveals its hundred potential consequences. What used to take days now takes weeks - not because you're slower, but because you can see more clearly what's at stake.\
The three phases look like this:\
First comes the , where you know just enough to act decisively. Everything feels clear because your vision is still simple.\
Then hits the , where your rapidly expanding knowledge shows you just how much could go wrong. Your confidence decreases as your awareness increases. Each decision feels heavier because you can see its full implications.\
But if you push through, you reach the . This is where expertise becomes power. You learn to operate with uncertainty rather than despite it. Your doubt transforms from a burden into sophisticated judgment.\
The same awareness that makes decisions harder also makes them better. Your uncertainty isn't a weakness - it's your evolved understanding expressing itself.Most people run from uncertainty. They see it as a weakness, as proof they don't know enough. But here's what changes everything: your growing uncertainty isn't a flaw - it's evidence of your expanding expertise.\
When you first start anything, certainty comes cheap. You haven't seen enough fail to doubt your decisions. You haven't watched enough strategies crumble to question your assumptions. Your confidence flows from your limited view.\
But then something shifts.\
As your expertise deepens, you begin seeing layers that others miss. Every decision reveals new complexities. Every strategy shows its hidden weaknesses. What looked simple became sophisticated.\
This is why the truly elite operators often sound the least certain. They're not confused or weak - they're just aware of what others can't see.The Science of Expert UncertaintyIn their pivotal 2009 paper "Conditions for Intuitive Expertise" published in American Psychologist, Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein studied when expert intuition can be trusted. Instead of just asserting that more expertise leads to better decisions, they found something more nuanced: expertise only develops effectively in environments with clear feedback and opportunities to practice.\
Think about what this means for decision-making:\
Expertise isn't just about accumulating knowledge - it's about developing sophisticated pattern recognition through repeated exposure and clear feedback loops. When those conditions exist, experts can process complex scenarios rapidly in ways that novices can't match.\
This translates directly to business:\
True expertise doesn't mean simpler decisions - it means better ways of navigating complexity. Kahneman and Klein found that the best performers aren't those who are most certain, but those who can effectively hold multiple competing scenarios in mind while still taking decisive action.\
This explains something crucial about your journey:\
Your growing uncertainty isn't a flaw - it's a natural result of developing true expertise. As your pattern recognition deepens, you see more variables, more connections, and more potential outcomes than ever before.\
Your uncertainty isn't your enemy. It's your edge.\
But what makes this journey so challenging is that as your expertise grows, you start carrying weights that others can't even see:Every past failure becomes a lesson that complicates future decisions.Every success shows you how many things had to go right.Every experience adds another layer of nuance to consider.\
It's like trying to sprint while carrying an invisible backpack that gets heavier with each step.\
This creates a unique kind of pressure:Your team wants clear answers, but you see endless nuance.Your investors want confident projections, but you see countless variables.Your market wants decisive action, but you see intricate dependencies.\
And here's the real kicker: The more successful you become, the more this intensifies.But here's where it gets interesting. At some point, something shifts:\
You stop fighting the complexity. You start using it.\
Your uncertainty becomes a tool rather than a burden.\
This happens when you realize:Being less certain makes you more accurate.Seeing more problems helps you build better solutions.Understanding complexity leads to simpler strategies.Your doubt is actually sophisticated pattern recognition.\
When Doubt Transforms into Power\
Most people never grasp what really happens as you gain deep expertise. They think the goal is to eliminate uncertainty. To become so knowledgeable that doubt disappears.\
They're looking at it backward.\
The Power of Sophisticated Uncertainty\
True expertise doesn't eliminate uncertainty - it transforms it. The same awareness that makes you pause before decisions also lets you spot opportunities others miss. Your slower pace isn't a weakness - it's the foundation of systems that actually scale.\
Think about how your mind evolves as expertise deepens:\
First comes . You start seeing rhymes in chaos. Market shifts whisper to you before they're obvious. Team dynamics reveal themselves in subtle signals that others miss entirely.\
Then develops . You stop thinking in simple steps and start seeing entire systems. Each decision reveals its ripple effects.\
You map implications that others can't even imagine.\
Finally emerges what I call . You move not just with speed, but with precision. Every action considers scale. Every choice leaves room for adaptation.\
The Reality of Elite Performance\
The best operators don't fight their doubt - they leverage it. Their uncertainty becomes a lens that reveals opportunities. Their awareness of complexity becomes their strategic advantage.\
This is why true expertise often feels like a paradox: The more you know, the more questions you have. The deeper your understanding, the greater your uncertainty.\
But that's exactly what makes it valuable.\
Because while others rush to judgment, you see the full picture. While others chase certainty, you navigate with sophistication. While others follow formulas, you move with nuance.\
Your doubt isn't your weakness. It's your evolved understanding expressing itself.\
Here's what changes everything:\
The moment you realize that your increasing uncertainty isn't a weakness – it's your evolved understanding expressing itself.How you navigate complexity\
Because here's the truth about expertise:\
It's not about having all the answers. It's about having the sophistication to ask better questions.\
It's not about being certain. It's about being capable despite uncertainty.\
And that sophisticated uncertainty? \
 Next time you feel that doubt creeping in about a decision, remember: You're not losing confidence. You're gaining sophistication.

There are a lot of error libraries available that do mostly the same things.
I maintain github.com/gregwebs/errors.A Panic in Go produces a stack trace, but an error does not.Adding a stack trace to your go code happens automatically with an error library that supports stack traces. If you use error creation functions:These will create an error with a stack trace.
Wrapping functions (see next sections) will automatically add a stack trace as well.I am told errors don't have traces because that this would have a negative performance impact.
However, in almost all of my usage of Go, when an error is returned performance is no longer a concern.
Sometimes when errors can alter performance that indicates an error is being returned for what is a normal condition rather than an error condition.
An example of this is read APIs returning EOF.
Certainly there are some cases where performance needs to be optimized on an error path. It's worth noting that the Zig language has figured out how to further minimize the impact of collecting error traces and allows them to be turned off in release builds.
Below we also see an example where a stack trace would not be helpful.
In these cases, one can still use standard APIs that don't add stack traces:Additionally, the github.com/gregwebs/errors library provides a 'WrapNoStack' function that can be used to wrap an error without adding a stack trace.The standard way of adding metadata to Go errors is to wrap them in format strings:I think that adding a new formatting verb for errors was a pragmatic choice to avoid dependency issues and match what users were currently doing, but I think the API is cryptic and limited compared to the library approach of:There is also a  function for using formatting strings. However, as I have shifted towards structured logging I want all my metadata structured, including for errors.
The errors library features an slog compatible API for adding metadata called  where "s" stands for "structured".A common pattern supported by the library is to accumulate attributes that can be used both with slog and for annotating errors:With a stack trace and relevant metadata annotating an error, I can frequently open up a bug report just from seeing the error report without having to dig into logs. When I do need to dig into the logs, having metadata on the error helps greatly with tracking things down. If you have a request id/trace id you can attach that to the error to help find it in the logs.Future maintainers of your code base will thank you when they can quickly track down errors.Future posts will discuss approaches to:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU to test Meta, X on disinformation before German election | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWoj_tLEr48</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 20:58:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The European Commission has asked social media giants including Meta, TikTok and X to take part in a test to see whether they are doing enough to counter disinformation in the run-up to next month's German election, an EU spokesperson said.

But the game is about more than algorithms, according to Marc Barthelemy, a physicist at the Paris-Saclay University in France, with layers of depth arising from the psychological complexity conferred by player strategies. Now, Barthelmey has taken things one step further by publishing a new paper in the journal Physical Review E that treats chess as a complex system, producing a handy metric that can help predict the proverbial "tipping points" in chess matches. [...]
 
For his analysis, Barthelemy chose to represent chess as a decision tree in which each "branch" leads to a win, loss, or draw. Players face the challenge of finding the best move amid all this complexity, particularly midgame, in order to steer gameplay into favorable branches. That's where those crucial tipping points come into play. Such positions are inherently unstable, which is why even a small mistake can have a dramatic influence on a match's trajectory. Barthelemy has re-imagined a chess match as a network of forces in which pieces act as the network's nodes, and the ways they interact represent the edges, using an interaction graph to capture how different pieces attack and defend one another. The most important chess pieces are those that interact with many other pieces in a given match, which he calculated by measuring how frequently a node lies on the shortest path between all the node pairs in the network (its "betweenness centrality").
 
He also calculated so-called "fragility scores," which indicate how easy it is to remove those critical chess pieces from the board. And he was able to apply this analysis to more than 20,000 actual chess matches played by the world's top players over the last 200 years. Barthelemy found that his metric could indeed identify tipping points in specific matches. Furthermore, when he averaged his analysis over a large number of games, an unexpected universal pattern emerged. "We observe a surprising universality: the average fragility score is the same for all players and for all openings," Barthelemy writes. And in famous chess matches, "the maximum fragility often coincides with pivotal moments, characterized by brilliant moves that decisively shift the balance of the game." Specifically, fragility scores start to increase about eight moves before the critical tipping point position occurs and stay high for some 15 moves after that. "These results suggest that positional fragility follows a common trajectory, with tension peaking in the middle game and dissipating toward the endgame," writes Barthelemy. "This analysis highlights the complex dynamics of chess, where the interaction between attack and defense shapes the game's overall structure."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>LIVE: Anti-abortion demonstration in Washington, DC</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3guJfdPnIyQ</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 20:40:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Anti-abortion activists march to Capitol Hill for the annual March for Life, just days after President Donald Trump's second inauguration.

As a result, the previously upstreamed DVFSRC Regulator and External Memory Interface (EMI) Interconnect drivers can now be enabled. This allows the System Companion Processor (SCP) Core Voltage and the EMI Bus Bandwidth to be scaled, improving the power efficiency of MediaTek-powered machines.Moreover, during a round of testing, Angelo also found that the MMC/SD Controller of MediaTek SoCs doesn't always embed Command Queue Hardware (CQHCI) on all SoCs or even on all instances of the said controller on the same SoCs. For example, on MT8186, MT8192, MT8195 (and others), the eMMC instance of this controller does support CQE by hardware but the (Micro)SD one does not: this brings numerous performance hits, sometimes also shown as micro-stuttering in UX, because of a necessary spinlock at every read, or write, operation.In order to overcome this, he implemented support in the MediaTek MMC/SD Controller driver (mtk-sd) for a software-based alternative for controller instances that don't support CQHCI, called Host Software Queue (HSQ): by doing so, MediaTek's driver acquires spinlocks less frequently, reducing expensive context switching, since it joins the sending of multiple commands into one single operation.His tests with this patch, which he ran on a MT8195 Tomato Chromebook with a SanDisk Extreme Pro (A2 rated) MicroSD card, show decreased average access times (with a reduction of up to 150 milliseconds during intensive read/write cycles). This is an improvement of +50.5% IOPS and bandwidth during random 4k reads/writes, +24.28% during random 4k reads, and +3.14% in sequential reads. This has greatly reduced UX micro-stuttering, making them mostly unnoticeable during read/write-intensive workloads, such as opening the Chromium or Firefox browsers on GNOME.Another notable contribution from Angelo includes the introduction of the support for OF Graphs in the MediaTek Display Controller (mediatek-drm) driver. The display IP cores in MediaTek SoCs allow a good amount of flexibility, supporting being interconnected with various different IP cores (for example, the Read DMA IP can be connected to either the Color Management, DisplayPort, DSI, Merge, or another IP) to form a full Display Data Path (DDP) that ends with an actual display. As the Display Data Path for a machine (Chromebook/Laptop, Smartphone, SBCs, etc) depends on the physically available display output(s), this cannot be hardcoded as a SoC-global parameter and is machine-specific.His change removes the need to hardcode display paths into the driver for each machine, allowing them to be specified in the Device Tree of the target machine with an OF Graph. This avoids unnecessary growth of the mediatek-drm driver and reflects the configuration flexibility of the MediaTek Display Controller into devicetree files.More contributions from Angelo include various other cleanups and improvements. He modernized the MediaTek RTC driver to use the RTC-subsystem provided APIs, reducing both binary and code size. He also added support for restricting Link Speed (Gen) and Link Width (Lanes) in the MediaTek PCI-Express Gen3 Controller driver.Stay tuned for more MediaTek updates, as well as a complete recap of our contributions to Linux 6.13.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Iroh: p2p chat, in rust, from scratch</title><link>https://youtu.be/ogN_mBkWu7o</link><author>/u/diogocsvalerio</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 20:09:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Rust</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Flipster Launches Superstars Program Amid Rapid User Growth Globally</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/flipster-launches-superstars-program-amid-rapid-user-growth-globally?source=rss</link><author>Chainwire</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 20:04:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Panama City, Panama, January 24th, 2025, Chainwire/--In a move to foster deeper connections with crypto communities and empower individuals passionate about the digital economy, Flipster, a global crypto trading exchange with millions of users and nearly $120 billion in annual trading volumes, is launching the .\

This is not merely a mandatory disclaimer; this is a warning. We will discuss some specific securities below that I am not  of recommending.Finance performs a strange alchemy, teleporting value through time and space. Ordinarily, Bits about Money focuses more on the plumbing of it than the deals. But a deal enthusiast who goes by The Conservative Income Investor recently flagged a capital raise to me. It has everything: echoes of the culture that is the American PMC 2020-2024, complex financial structuring, a novel web application to move money, a crypto company in the background, and municipal politics. So it seems squarely within this column’s beat.The municipality happens to be Chicago, my hometown and (after a 20 year stint in Japan) current residence. And so I feel some sense of civic duty, as a Chicagoan, taxpayer, and reasonably financially sophisticated person, to say the following publicly: But before we get to present-day shenanigans, we need to go back several decades, because municipal politics is inextricable from the shenanigans.Chicago has wanted a casino for a long timeChicago and the state of Illinois more broadly have a deeply unserious polity. It has mortgaged its future through consistently overpaying public sector employees (principally, in Chicago, police/fire/teachers) and undertaxing. Neither decreasing total compensation of public sector employees nor reneging on previously-negotiated deferred compensation (pensions and healthcare for retirees) nor raising taxes to appropriate levels is considered politically palatable. One reason is that the Illinois state constitution (Article 13 Section 5) makes public employee pensions sacrosanct. The constitution is, of course, not a fact of nature; it is a political compromise by, again, a deeply unserious polity.And so Illinois and Chicago specifically are constantly on the make for new revenue streams. One which was mooted since my childhood in the 1980s was an expansion of gambling. So-called sin taxes (on gambling, liquor, tobacco, and similar) are politically attractive because they do not cause as much opposition as raising consumption or property taxes.And so Chicago has had a decades-long campaign to build a casino within city limits. Why couldn’t Chicago actually get this done in several decades? One reason is the usual incompetence. The other reason is that the political economy of casinos is controversial. Many policies create winners and losers, but casinos inescapably create losers than most policies up for vote. Local political elites often band together against them, worried about siphoning money from local consumers. They also worry that they tend to create spillover effects, such as crime and moral collapse among a portion of patrons.And so, as I once mentioned in a podcast with Thinking Poker, pro-casino political coalitions try to pick off anti-casino political elites by assuaging their concerns and/or bribing them. (In Japan, the de facto concession was “We’ll limit the amount Japanese people can lose here and maximize for soaking Chinese tourists. Now, let’s write that down in a way which doesn’t say exactly that, because it sounds bad if you put it that way.”)In Chicago, much of the opposition came from African American political elites. They had the usual set of concerns for casinos, plus one other which is slightly more idiosyncratic. A belief with wide currency in that community is that the community would be much more wealthy than it currently is, but for vice entrepreneurs siphoning that community’s resources out of the community. This belief has lead to e.g. pogroms against Korean liquor store owners. I direct interested readers to histories of the Rodney King riots or the Asian American experience in 20th century America. (This was covered extensively in an elective I took more than 20 years ago, and so I have since forgotten the academic citations for this true but parenthetical point.)Bally’s won the bid for the newly licensed Chicago casino in 2022, in part due to offering the right mix of concessions and inducements in its Host Community Agreement. One of those was promising Chicago that the new casino would be at least 25% owned by women and Minorities. The M is capital in the Chicago municipal code, and I will preserve this stylistic choice, because the word does not mean what most educated Americans assume it means. We shall return to that meaning later.In fulfillment of its obligations under the HCA, Bally’s Chicago, Inc., an entity in the corporate web which will build and operate the casino, has conducted a stock offering since December. It runs through January 2025.The stock offering has a prospectus associated with it. BCI does not appear to be relying on an exemption from registration, in the fashion that e.g. most startups would, restricting them to raising money from accredited investors.While reading the prospectus, I read a much-remarked-upon statement, and assumed it was a misprint.This offering is only being made to individuals and entities that satisfy the Class A Qualification Criteria (as defined herein). Our Host Community Agreement with the City of Chicago requires that 25% of Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s equity must be owned by persons that have satisfied the Class A Qualification Criteria. The Class A Qualification Criteria include, among other criteria, that the person:if an individual, must be a woman;if an individual, must be a Minority, as defined by MCC 2-92-670(n) (see below); orif an entity, must be controlled by women or Minorities.Why did I assume this was a mistake? Well, for one thing, on the face of it Bally’s has told the SEC that this offering is only available to Minorities who are  women, which does not match the intent expressed elsewhere or during their roadshow. I have immense sympathy for drafting errors. Bally’s, feel free to let the lawyers know they forgot a significant “or” on the first bullet point. [: An actual lawyer, not an Internet lawyer, informs me that the first bullet point has an implied "or" in this construction. Mea maxima culpa, associate who drafted this.] The other reason I thought this was likely a mistake is that the American social, legal, and constitutional order is profoundly opposed to discrimination by race, and considers that action . Even when individual actors  to do it, they usually feel embarrassed enough about it to dissemble. For example, the last few years tech companies absolutely, notoriously engaged in legally prohibited discrimination in hiring, sometimes as an intentionally directed and explicitly written down policy. This is often assumed to be a conspiracy theory by disaffected white males. Perhaps that is an understandable belief, since people who read the project plans either a) supported them or b) value their future careers and are therefore mostly not leaking them, and thus we only have public evidence of those project plans which end up screenshotted in litigation. Similarly, when I say that the state of California proudly engaged in redlining in the provision of lifesaving medical care in 2021, many people of good-will assume that I simply  be mistaken. I get it, but I was there.Returning from the ancient history of 2021 to this very week: Chicago has directed a private entity to segregate, and that entity is segregating, principally via web application. If you attempt to engage Bally’s for an investment here, you will see the following blocking question during qualification stages for the investment opportunity. (The web application will also ask for your name, address, social security number, and accredited investor status.)There is a right answer to this question. If you give the wrong answer, Bally’s will decline you the opportunity to invest. You get entirely stopped by the web application.I express no opinion on whether this is legal, by Bally’s or Chicago. After all, I am not a lawyer, and this has certainly been seen by many lawyers at this point, in e.g. preparing the submission to the SEC. Presumably all of them went through 1L courses which introduced concepts like the Fourteenth Amendment, case law which says government actions discriminating by race are subject to strict scrutiny, and case law which says that the government cannot proxy through a private entity to do things it is prohibited to do itself. And clearly no one admitted to the bar in Illinois thinks that Chicago can waive the U.S. Constitution if it considers that politically advantageous to get a gridlocked casino through municipal politics.So I will charitably assume the existence of a memo where competent professionals have laid out a case for the legality of this course of action. They must have concluded that no future Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, not even in an administration elected after the Host Community Agreement had been inked, would descend upon this official act like the hammer of an avenging god.Chicago’s peculiar definition of MinorityLong-time observers of Chicago politics might opine that the city very rarely does anything without creating a carveout for politically connected individuals. The local phrase for this sort of social connection is having “clout” or, sometimes, “is clouted.” You can find examples of the sort of carveouts Chicago reserves for the clouted in the professional histories of the board members of Bally’s Chicago, Inc, for example, which are included in the prospectus.So what’s the carveout here? The definition of a racial or ethnic minority is a legendarily contentious one in U.S. politics, largely because inclusion or exclusion from it makes one eligible (or ineligible) for concrete benefits. Sites of contention often include e.g. are Asian Americans a minority, or are e.g. Cuban Americans Hispanic, etc.Chicago leaves itself an out for its definition of Minority, which lets it designate any individual or group as a Minority, on an ad hoc, unreported, unaccountable basis. That sounds like I must be strawmanning Chicago. See the below screenshot and explanation in the prospectusQualification under [the final] clause is determined on a case-by-case basis and there is no exhaustive or definitive list of groups or individuals that the City of Chicago has determined to qualify as Minority under this clause. However, in the event the City of Chicago identifies any additional groups or individuals as falling under this clause in the future, members of such groups would satisfy the Class A Qualification Criteria.Now, fairminded people reading “groups… found by the City of Chicago to be socially disadvantaged by having suffered racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias within American society” would note “Well, OK, on the face of it, that definitely includes e.g. Jewish Americans or Irish Americans. We have some lamentable history as a nation and city, sure. But no intellectually serious person in the United States considers Irish Americans ‘a racial or ethnic minority’ in the common usage of the term.” And thus, the capitalization of Minority.You’ll have to ask the city for their list of ad hoc exceptions made under this bullet point. Long-time watchers of Chicago municipal politics, however, might say that asking is of limited utility.I will note that, as a matter of engineering fact, the web application will blithely accept self-certification under this bullet point . You are welcome to your guess as to whether Bally’s or any city employee will review the 1,000 investors individually and, if they review them, what the process is for determining whether e.g. a particular Patrick counts as a Minority or not. I’d wager there is no process at all here. It seems like a better bet than most offered in the casino.Bally’s Chicago is a product of Bally’s, a publicly traded company. You can read their 10-Ks. According to their most recent quarterly report, they operate 15 casinos across the U.S., and have substantial online gambling operations. Like many casinos, they are  diversified, insofar as a casino resort also functions as a hotel and restaurant/bar/etc venue.Bally’s Chicago has a complex capital stack, which one would probably need to understand to evaluate the opportunity to invest in it. I am not saying “complex” as a criticism: this is fairly ho hum by the standards of large commercial real estate developments, a subject I am not an expert on but grew up hearing about at the dinner table. I  heavily implying that I would not expect a Chicagoan picked at random, or for that matter an alderman, to be able to look at the following diagram and correctly describe what it means. Prospectus, ibid, pg 145.The entity which Chicago is stumping for is Bally’s Chicago, Inc. (BCI), the central square on that diagram.  investors are receiving ownership in , not in , which will be operated by Bally’s Chicago Operating Company, LLC (BCOC). That entity gets 25% economic interest in the future profits (insert  asterisk here) of the casino; the other 75% flows to Bally’s Chicago Holding Company, LLC (BCHC). BCHC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bally’s, Inc, the publicly traded company.When one offers someone the opportunity to invest in something, one has to decide upon a valuation for the something. The price of a slice of the pie is set in notional reference to the price of the whole pie.Bally’s says that its good faith guesstimate on the whole pie is the economic interest in future profits of the Chicago casino is… a billion dollars exactly. The prospectus, as is wont for these situations, disclaims floridly that that price might not be accurate. One example of many: “We made a number of assumptions to determine the price of our Class A Interests. If any of our assumptions are incorrect, including our assumptions regarding the total enterprise value of the Company, then the Class A Interests will be worth less than the price stated in this prospectus. In such case, the return on investment or rate of return on an investment in our Class A Interests could be significantly below an investor’s expectation.”Bally’s will, as is standard and customary for this sort of thing, pretend that investors have read and understood the ~200 page prospectus, and civil society will pretend to believe them.It isn’t  to pick a billion dollars out of one’s hindquarters as an investment valuation. That particular number exerts a sort of memetic quality in e.g. Silicon Valley, and there are legendary amounts of negotiation between sophisticated parties to accept just a bit more structure to get a e.g. $920 million valuation to a $1 billion valuation, because so-called unicorn status is good for PR, for attracting prospective employees, and (a real factor) for founder ego.But if you invest at a valuation not justified by the fundamentals of the investment, you will tend to underperform. This is an inescapable fact of investing. (And that is why the sophisticated investors, accepting a “worse” valuation, want “better” structure to compensate for it.)And this partially explains why Chicago is holding a roadshow in African American churches attempting to convince participants to invest in a mezzanine-y equity slice of a casino at a $1 billion valuation, perhaps at 100X leverage. (I tip my cap to publicly available reporting of the roadshow.) And not, for example, attempting to convince Goldman Sachs to put together some sophisticated investors and take down the $250 million allocation.Is this valuation a gift to investors?Chicago’s pitch to investors, delivered (per above reporting by Triibe) by “City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin and members of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus”, emphasizes the potential of creating “generational wealth” (direct quote) with this casino investment. This point of view aligns with the above described political economy of attempting to buy off influential communities and/or community elites with an equity carveout, which successfully got this particular casino through decades of political gridlock.And so the investment case  that Bally’s is intentionally giving takers something for nothing. That is, they must be sandbagging the valuation they assigned to this bundle of rights: it’s not really worth $1 billion, it is worth e.g. $5 billion. Only you favored Chicagoans well-loved by your alderman are able to buy at the non-market price, leading to essentially free money. Not merely small amounts of it, either. Generational. Wealth.The pitch very likely explicitly said the requisite words about this being a risky investment, wink wink, and very definitely described an opportunity for extreme levels of leverage and a lengthy expected road to ROI, which we’ll return to in a moment.Do I think sophisticated investors would agree with Bally’s that this bundle of rights is worth $1 billion? One reason is the perception of an absence: why is this pitch being given to individual savers in a church at a minimum investment of $250, and not in a swank office to an entity capable of committing $25 million? But perhaps I’m just suspicious.No, let’s go to more direct evidence: if 25% of this bundle of rights is worth $250 million, then 75% must be worth $750 million, right? And if an entity owning 75% of the bundle, Bally’s, also owns 14 other casinos, online gambling properties, and similar, then that entity must be worth a lot more than $750 million, right?The market does not agree with this assessment. The entire market capitalization of Bally’s (NYSE: BALY) is, as of this writing, ~$1.5 billion. What’s the difference between the $50 million average imputed value of the other casinos and the $750 million imputed value of the Chicago casino? The $750 million is , that’s what.And, again, the  of this pitch is that the bundle of rights is getting sold on the cheap, and that it is actually worth much more than $1 billion. It very clearly is not, or sophisticated investors would be swooping in and buying BALY’s common stock. Crack it open like an oyster and dig into that sweet sweet Chicago gambling revenue if you need to!This is somewhat elementary and handwavy napkin analysis of a complicated business which, like most casinos and hotels, is heavily levered with a complex capital stack. But the investment case gets smothered by a napkin.Capital stack arbitrage, or, giving retail 100:1 leverage on single stock issuancesThe Host Community Agreement, as above, obligates Bally’s to find a way to sell preferred Chicagoans $250 million of stock. This was likely complicated by rich Chicagoans not being suckers and less-well-off Chicagoans not having $250 million lying around.And so Bally’s has introduced a novel structure.In brief, that structure sells stock to investors on credit, with the credit being extended by Bally’s, and paid down by future dividend distributions of the stock. If you’re very interested in the mechanics, you can find them at length in the prospectus, but the complex legal code is an excuse for this screenshot:What is the “Attributable Subordinated Loan?” I’m glad you asked. Bally’s staked (ba dum bum) BCI with a few hundred million dollars to fund development. Where did it find the money to do that? A mix of equity and debt financing, as is common for virtually all complex commercial real estate transactions. Bally’s, per their most recent 10-K, has long-term debt from sophisticated investors which costs them 5.x% per year. (It would be more expensive if they wanted to lock that down today.)In return for Bally’s advancing BCI money through BCHC, BCI owed BCHC money, on an intercompany IOU. This capital offering cancels that intercompany IOU and replaces it with the Subordinated Loans. The prospectus does not quote the rate that the left pocket of Bally’s charged the right pocket of Bally’s. It does quote the rate for the Subordinated Loans: 11% annually compounding quarterly.The road show makes much of the fact that this leverage is non-recourse. Quoting the Triibe reporting again:The loan is non-recourse, explained Sidney Dillard of Loop Capital Markets, who is the underwriter of the offering, during the information session. “That loan is not recourse, meaning that you are not responsible for it,” she said.I am not someone who has ever offered SEC registered securities for sale, but I am aware that when one does that, one has to adopt a  with respect to how one simultaneously a) sells a product that one has to offer and b) describes the operations of that product without wandering into lying.And so  would not describe “non-recourse” as a loan one is not responsible for. I have a non-recourse mortgage. I am very, very much responsible for paying the mortgage. If I do not pay the mortgage, I expect to swiftly not own the property securing the mortgage. The “non-recourse” bit means that the lender cannot come after your  assets or income, for example by suing you for a judgement, then forcing you to disgorge your savings account or e.g. interests in a wholly owned LLC.The Subordinated Loans are, per the prospectus (probably a bit more reliable than the understanding of e.g. Chicago employees on the finer details), not between the owners of the Class-A{1,2,3} equity and any Bally’s entities. They are strictly loans between Bally’s entities themselves. Those loans are senior to Class-A{1,2,3} equity in the payments waterfall of future profits (we need that asterisk again!) from the casino to equity holders. The expectation is that Bally’s will individually book repayments against records which are kept on a per-shareholder basis without actually obligating the shareholder, while keeping the actual cash thrown off by the casino, prior to eventually releasing a shareholder from the indebtedness that Bally’s will say that, technically speaking, they have not actually incurred.At that point, the shareholder will own the slice of equity that an unsophisticated listener of that roadshow might think they own free-and-clear.Now, Bally’s forecasts that many shareholders will be very underwater on these investments. (Wow, that’s a  sentence.) Prospectus, ibid, pg 23:Given the capital intensity of developing, constructing, opening and operating a casino resort project of this scale, we currently expect that Bally’s Chicago OpCo will not have any OpCo cash available for distribution until approximately three to five years after our permanent resort and casino begins operations.Assuming the most charitable estimate from that range, a Class A-3 shareholder will have $250 of equity securing a notional $25,000 investment and future obligations of approximately $34,000 (three years of compound interest on $24,750). This suggests that the holder’s equity value is  and that no sophisticated investor would purchase that investment for the $25,000 which the unsophisticated shareholder might believe it to be worth in 3 years. They might be willing to pay something more similar to, hmm, negative nine thousand dollars.Seen in that light this offer of investment sounds predatory. But don’t worry, Chicagoans, Bally’s has your back. You do not have to worry about not being able to sell your stock due to its lack of intrinsic value, because you are not able to sell your stock. Prospectus, ibid, pg 179 under heading Shares Eligible For Future Sale, and elsewhere in the document.Class A-4 holders, the ones with no notional debt, who purchased their shares for $25,000 cash-on-the-barrel, are not eligible to sell their stock at any time except as allowed by Bally’s to people approved by Bally’s. (I’ll flag that this is not an unusual term in private equities. Bally’s pre-commitment to discriminating racially against future prospective buyers?  unusual.)Buyers of Class A-{1,2,3} stock are unable to sell until the associated Subordinated Loan is paid off in full.One wonders whether senior Chicago officials will be doing a roadshow in 2030 explaining what happened.The casino will not distribute profits, per seWhile the natural expectation is that one is participating in the profits of the casino, the prospectus helpfully clarifies that one is not. The "cash available for distribution" does not necessarily correspond 1:1 with profits. It... well. See the discussion on page 22 and 23 of the prospectus, including the excerpt below.While we and Bally’s Chicago OpCo intend to make distributions equal to 100% of the cash available for distribution and OpCo cash available for distribution, respectively, on a quarterly basis, the actual amount of any distributions may fluctuate depending on our and Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s ability to generate cash from operations and our and Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s cash flow needs, which, among other things, may be impacted by debt service payments on our or Bally’s Chicago OpCo’s senior indebtedness, capital expenditures, potential expansion opportunities and the availability of financing alternatives, the need to service any future indebtedness or other liquidity needs and general industry and business conditions, including the pace of the construction and development of our permanent resort and casino in Chicago. Our Board will have full discretion on how to deploy cash available for distribution, including the payment of dividends. Any debt we or Bally’s Chicago OpCo may incur in the future is likely to restrict our and Bally’s Chicago OpCo ability to pay dividends or distributions, and such restriction may prohibit us and Bally’s Chicago OpCo from making distributions, or reduce the amount of cash available for distribution and OpCo cash available for distribution.Now, as someone who grew up with a father constantly complaining about sharp operating in Chicago commercial real estate, I can quickly outline about two dozen different ways for one to cause the operating company here to a) transfer money to other corporate entities and b) therefore have less cash available for distribution.As a representative but not limiting example, you can probably choose your own marks for technology services from a parent to a great-grandchild subsidiary. Sure, there is some notional expectation that the marks be at arms-length price, but what is the arms-length price for e.g. casino loyalty accounting software and a particular chain's database of existing users? What low-resourced investor could possibly mount a court challenge against the entity with all the data necessary to value that asset. In Las Vegas, a casino has to calculate and diligently communicate the house edge before raking punters. Here... not so much.That would require sharp operating... of a sort which is  in Chicago commercial real estate. This is a constant risk of being the junior partner in a structure, particularly without an aligned senior partner who would be as adversely impacted by sharp operating as you would be. Of course, here the senior partner owns e.g. the database they are renting to the entity that they also control, and so funds available for distribution from that entity might not match the expectations of junior partners.Pick your sponsors carefully, folks.Tax consequences of this offeringSuppose, and this is very unlikely because it is illegal (Reg T) but run with it, that one has a typical brokerage account in the United States and, with $250, purchases $25,000 of marketable securities. Those securities periodically throw off dividend payments. One periodically pays one’s brokerage interest, because one has borrowed money from the brokerage to buy those securities on margin.In the typical case, one would be taxed upon those interest payments, which are income. One does not simply  one’s margin interest against that income before paying taxes. One instead must itemize, and then one will be able to (on Schedule A) deduct investment expenses, as described in Publication 550. Feel free to run this by your accountant; the details get complicated and wonky.If one does not itemize, as many lower-income taxpayers do not, one must of course simply pay the tax on the entirety of one’s interest income. If one protests that one does not actually  any interest income, because it has been taken by one’s brokerage to pay margin interest, the IRS will not be maximally sympathetic.Bally’s has very creative professionals involved in the structuring of this offering, and realizing the above issue would compromise fitness for purpose, they have… adopted a theory. I will quote that theory, from the prospectus, verbatim. I have taken the liberty of bolding an important bit in the middle of this.Section 305 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that if a corporation distributes property to some shareholders and other shareholders have an increase in their proportionate interests in the assets or earnings and profits of the corporation, such other shareholders may be deemed to receive a distribution that could be a taxable dividend. In this case, because we and Bally’s expect to treat the Subordinated Loans as “stock” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, “property” distributions will likely be considered to be made to “some shareholders” of Bally’s Chicago, Inc. as payments are made on the Subordinated Loans, and equivalent cash (“property”) distributions will be made with respect to the Class A-4 Interests. In addition, as payments are made on the Subordinated Loans, particularly those that repay the original principal amount of such Subordinated Loans, the proportionate interests of holders of our Class A-1 Interests, Class A-2 Interests and Class A-3 Interests in the assets or earnings and profits of Bally’s Chicago, Inc. may be viewed as increasing. Accordingly, it is possible that such increase could be treated as a deemed distribution under Section 305 of the Code or otherwise as taxable income to such holders under other theories. However, under the Treasury Regulations relating to Section 305 of the Code and other IRS administrative guidance, certain financing arrangements in the form of preferred stock investments that fund a corporation and then are systematically eliminated through property distributions until they are fully retired, and are designed to facilitate the ownership of a business with an effect of increasing another stockholder’s proportionate interests in the assets or earnings and profits of a corporation over such period, do not result in a deemed distribution to such other stockholder. The applicability of these authorities to the holders of our Class A-1 Interests, Class A-2 Interests and Class A-3 Interests in this situation is uncertain. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and this discussion assumes, that U.S. Holders of applicable series of Class A Interests would not be treated as receiving a deemed distribution from us or otherwise realizing income as a result of repayment of the Subordinated Loans corresponding to such shares. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position, for example, treating the proportionate interest in our earnings and profits owned by U.S. Holders of the applicable series of Class A Interests as having increased upon repayment of the Subordinated Loans corresponding to such shares, and treating such U.S. Holders as having received a distribution. In that case, such deemed distribution will be taxable as a dividend, return of capital or capital gain as described above under “— Distributions,” and U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax without the receipt of any cash. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about the application of Code Section 305 and any other potential deemed receipt of income risk with respect to our Class A Interests .Now, I’m neither a lawyer, tax accountant, nor am I someone who listened carefully to the roadshow when it doubtlessly stepped through this for the benefit of the audience. But here’s what it means:Bally’s is taking the position, though they acknowledge that the IRS might disagree, that owners of the Class A-{2,3,4} interests aren’t  getting any income until the Subordinated Loans have been paid in full. This means that they don’t have to pay income taxes in years where they are not actually receiving cash distributions.No, they wait until the Subordinated Loan is paid in full, and then immediately owe income taxes in one whack, at the difference between their basis in the stock (say, $250) and the then-FMV of the stock (say, $25,000). Resulting in Bally’s diligently filing a document with the IRS saying that e.g. a lower-income Chicagoan has just received a bit less than $25,000 in income from them, and should probably pay taxes on it. You can, of course, receive income without receiving ; it happens all the time in tech, and is the cause of much structuring to avoid the consequences of it, which can be painful for e.g. early career employees. Those taxes will be paid substantially out-of-pocket, because there is almost no conceivable universe where a stock of an actual healthy operating enterprise worth e.g. $25,000 pays an ordinary dividend of e.g. $5,000. The market would adjust the value of the stock upwards to account for the extraordinarily rich stream of dividends, which would adjust the tax bill upwards.Financially sophisticated investors might prepare for a tax bomb like this by e.g. borrowing against the value of the stock. That’s basically impossible for this issuance, due to the stock not being publicly listed, the restrictions on transfer, small dollar amounts, etc. The other option is, of course, selling the stock, to whomever Bally’s deigns to approve.Tax-motivated transactions are, of course, , and the lucky buyer will probably be able to extract a bit of a deal, doubly so because they are likely much more sophisticated than the initial buyer of the stock, and they have less risk to account for (because of e.g. several years of operating history of the casino before the tax bomb explodes).I am not an investment advisor, and not your investment advisor. I am, however, a recreational poker player who lives in Chicago. I intend to periodically donate money to the Chicago economy by making poor decisions on the river at Bally’s Chicago. I do not, however, presently intend to participate in Bally’s stock offering, nor do I presently intend to buy their common stock.I will note, out of an overabundance of scrupulousness, that I own a tiny amount of MGM stock, which is a direct competitor to Bally’s. I caught the poker bug at a conference in Las Vegas (hosted at the Tropicana, since acquired by Bally’s and then brought down in a controlled implosion).MGM, across the street, actually had poker tables. I have had many enjoyable post-conference excursions staying at their hotel to (in several but not all years) lose money at those tables. I bought the stock for the same reason I buy stock in every hotel, airline, bank, and similar I use: in the unlikely event a not-particularly-high-stakes poker player has a routine customer service complaint, Investor Relations is available as an escalation strategy, over e.g. hotel staff who might be long-since inured to listening to complaints from people who lost money in a casino.Oh yeah, I mentioned that there is a crypto angle to this. The registrar and transfer agent for offering 100:1 leverage to retail investors on a casino stock is, see prospectus pg 41, BitGo Trust. If I had made up that detail, as a crypto skeptic, you might have accused me of being a bit on the nose.Bits about Money yearly recap and plans →]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US existing home sales in 2024 drop to lowest level since 1995 | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqL6gCs6jT0</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 19:55:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US existing home sales in 2024 dropped to their lowest level since 1995.

At Compose, WebSockets form the backbone of our service, powering our backend SDKs that enable developers to deliver low-latency interactive applications with just backend code.But, scaling WebSockets has proven to be far more complex than we expected. Below are some of the most important lessons we've learned along the way.Handle deployments gracefullyUsers should never notice when deployments happen, so WebSocket connections need to persist across deployments. This is a delicate process, and requires robust reconnection logic to deal with unexpected issues. At Compose, we achieve near-zero downtime by following these steps:Once the new servers are healthy, old servers begin returning responses to health checks.After 4 consecutive  responses, the load balancer declares the server unhealthy and removes the old servers from the pool. The load balancer health checks every 5 seconds, so this process takes up to 25 seconds.Old servers send a custom WebSocket close message instructing clients to delay reconnection by a random interval to avoid a reconnection surge.The custom close message lets clients show users a more accurate message during the ~10 second period where the client is disconnected.The random delay helps prevent thundering herd issues where all clients reconnect at once. Clients also double the exponential backoff for deployment-related reconnections to account for unforseen issues.The close message is delayed by 20 seconds to account for the time it takes for the load balancer to shift traffic.Once all clients disconnect, the old servers shut down completely.If you're using a managed service like Render or Railway, you should be especially cognizant that client connections are transferred gracefully during deployments.Many managed services that tout zero-downtime deployments will wait until all outstanding requests are processed before shutting down a server. Since WebSocket connections are persistent, this can lead to situations in which old servers are active for minutes or even hours after a deploy until the managed service forcibly terminates the process.Establish a consistent message schemaWhile HTTP comes with built-in routing conventions (,,), WebSockets require developers to define their own schema for organizing messages.At Compose, every WebSocket message starts with a fixed 2-byte prefix for categorizing messages.It's space-efficient (only 2 bytes), while still scaling to 65,536 different types.It enables clients to reliably slice the prefix from the message without affecting the rest of the data, since the prefix is always 2 bytes.It gives us a simple method for upgrading our APIs by versioning message types. = {
  : ,
  : ,
  : ,
  : ,
  
}Additionally, we use delimiters to separate different fields inside the message, which is both faster to encode/decode and more memory-efficient than JSON. = ;

() {
   [[], ...args].();
}

() {
   [, ...args] = message.();
   { , args };
}We're lucky that our backend and frontend are written in TypeScript, allowing us to share message schemas between the two and ensure that neither falls out of sync.Detect silent disconnects with heartbeatsConnections can drop unexpectedly without triggering aclose event, leading to a situation in which the client thinks they're connected, but actually aren't. To prevent stale connections, implementing a robust heartbeat mechanism is essential.We send periodicping/pong messagesbetween client and server and reconnect in cases where the heartbeat isn't received within some interval.Our server sends a  message every 30 seconds, and expects a  response. In cases where the client doesn't receive a every 45 seconds, it immediately drops the connection and tries to reconnect. Similarly, the server closes connections that miss responses within 45 seconds.By monitoring heartbeats on both ends, we detect and handle rare cases where the client side network appears functional but the server never receives responses.WebSocket connections can be unexpectedly blocked, especially on restrictive public networks. To mitigate such issues, Compose usesserver-sent events (SSE)as a fallback for receiving updates, while HTTP requests handle client-to-server communication.Since SSE is HTTP-based, it's much less likely to be blocked, providing a reliable alternative in restricted environments. Plus it still achieves decently low latency, especially compared to short-polling solutions.There's a whole lot more to scaling WebSockets that we didn't cover here. For example:: While most frameworks include built-in tools for rate limiting, data validation, and error handling, you'll generally have to implement these features on your own for WebSockets.: Edge networks make it easy to cache HTTP responses close to users, but there's no standard way to accomplish this with WebSockets.: Guarding against abuse by ensuring that each message is valid for that user before processing it.But regardless of the complexity, users expect modern applications to be fast, realtime, and collaborative. And, as of now, there's no better way to achieve that than WebSockets.At Compose, WebSockets power the entire platform - from the database all the way to the main UI thread. Via our SDKs, developers can generate full web apps from their backend logic. Making sure those apps are fast and performant at scale requires WebSockets.

It takes less than 5 minutes to install the SDK and build your first app.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says will sign executive order to change or get rid of FEMA | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9ZqYsxmexE</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 19:40:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump announced plans to sign an executive order aimed at fundamentally overhauling or possibly eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

"North Korean IT workers have copied company code repositories, such as GitHub, to their own user profiles and personal cloud accounts. While not uncommon among software developers, this activity represents a large-scale risk of theft of company code," the FBI said. 

"North Korean IT workers could attempt to harvest sensitive company credentials and session cookies to initiate work sessions from non-company devices and for further compromise opportunities." To mitigate these risks, the FBI advised companies to apply the principle of least privilege by disabling local administrator accounts and limiting permissions for remote desktop applications. Organizations should also monitor for unusual network traffic, especially remote connections since North Korean IT personnel often log into the same account from various IP addresses over a short period of time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Would you ever pay/donate to a Photoshop competitor that is Linux-first?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i92s5c/would_you_ever_paydonate_to_a_photoshop/</link><author>/u/True-Direction5217</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:48:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've seen many posts throughout the years that share my sentiment on not having Photoshop on Linux, and that the alternatives aren't in one way or another filling that need. I've realized that even if Photoshop came to Linux today, I don't think I'd use it, because of Adobe. I left Windows because software these days are plagued by enshitifcation, invading your privacy, poor performance and security. Top it off with Adobe's recent nonsense around training on your data and exorbitant cancellation fees, was the final nail in the coffin for me.So I decided to work on my own PS-like editor that have been such a joy to write so far, but still very far off from a releasable state. I would love to work on full-time and thinking about raising some form of funding instead of working at another morally-bankrupt company.I know some will ask why not help out on other existing projects like Gimp. The reason is quite simply these projects are built on years of legacy code with a vision & programming language that isn't completely compatible with mine. None of my MRs would ever get accepted because what I have in mind for my editor would simply not be possible without major rewrites. It would be much easier to start from scratch.From what I can gather, Adobe does not see it as worth investing in adding support for Linux, whether that is just due to the size of the user base or maybe they feel people in the Linux community are less inclined to pay for software in general. So my question to the community: Would anyone be interested in buying or donating to such a thing or am I completely delusional here?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>More underweighted meat uncovered as big grocers hit with class action lawsuit</title><link>https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/meat-weigh-grocers-1.7440150</link><author>/u/Isacobs_35160_LHM</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:45:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After Deborah Eakins read the recent  about Loblaw, Sobeys and Walmart grocery stores overcharging customers by selling underweighted meat, she weighed her ground beef.To her surprise, the meat, bought at Sobeys-owned Pete's Frootique in the Halifax area, appeared to have been weighed with the hard plastic packaging.CBC News purchased three packages of ground beef from the same store and got the same results. The calculated overcharge was $1.23 — six per cent on the $21.29 bill.Under federal regulations, posted net weights for packaged food — and prices based on that weight — can't include the packaging. "It makes me angry," said Eakins, who sent an online complaint to the store. "I really don't like to think that I'm paying for packaging. Grocery prices have gotten horrendous over the last couple of years."CBC's investigation has sparked anger among shoppers who are grappling with high food prices.It also prompted NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to ask the Competition Bureau to "hold these giant corporations accountable" and provide better protections for shoppers.Meanwhile, the big grocers are making efforts to convince customers there's no need for concern. In November 2024, CBC News found underweighted meat at a Sobeys-owned FreshCo store in Toronto. At the time, Sobeys said it was addressing the matter. In response to the Halifax case, Sobeys spokesperson Karen White-Boswell thanked CBC News for alerting the grocer."On the rare occasions when an error occurs, we respond immediately… so that it can be corrected," she said in an email. Eakins said a Pete's Frootique representative offered her compensation for being "mischarged."  "I said, 'I actually don't want to be compensated. What I want is the assurance that every package of meat I buy from now on, I won't be paying for the packaging.'"White-Boswell says Sobeys has followed up with the store and reinforced its meat-weighing procedures and policies.Loblaw customer Iris Griffin also wants assurance the meat she's buying has been weighed properly. In late 2023, Griffin complained to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) about underweighted meat she bought at a Loblaw-owned Superstore. The grocer said it sold "a small number" of underweighted meat products across 80 stores due to an error involving a change in packaging. The CFIA says it issued no penalties because Loblaw said it fixed the problem. Close to one year later, CBC News found underweighted meat in two Loblaw stores. In response, Loblaw apologized to customers, and said it fixed the error and refreshed in-store training. Following her experience, Griffin says she was "pleasantly surprised" to learn that a proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed in Federal Court. The suit alleges Loblaw, Sobeys and Walmart misrepresented the weight of meat products by including the weight of the packaging, or by "other similarly deceptive means."The suit has yet to be certified. Nevertheless, Griffin hopes it sends a message. "It gives people a sense that something is being done and that the retailer is being held accountable for the money that they've taken from consumers," she said. Loblaw and Sobeys did not comment on the lawsuit. Walmart also did not respond directly to the suit. But the retailer, in response to CBC News's earlier investigation — which found a Richmond, B.C., location sold underweighted meat — said that the third party responsible had immediately corrected the problem.That third party confirmed that the issue had been "limited to select products" and only happened "during a two-week period in December 2024," said Walmart spokesperson Stephanie Fusco.But CBC News spoke with a customer who complained on social media back in October — two months earlier — that the beef steak she bought at the store had been weighed with the packaging. A photo she took of her weighing the meat showed that it was packaged on Oct. 8, 2024.In response, Fusco said that Walmart is looking into the matter. She added that while this issue "has been limited to third-party packaging," Walmart is reviewing its weighing systems to ensure it remains compliant. Investigation by phone and emailGriffin says she was surprised to learn that when the CFIA investigated her complaint about underweighted beef sold by Loblaw, the agency didn't inspect any stores but, instead, conducted the investigation by phone and email. Jay Jackson inspected consumer products, including food — for a predecessor of the CFIA — from 1983 to 1987. He says, during this period, a complaint like Griffin's would automatically prompt onsite inspections. WATCH | Proposed class-action lawsuit filed:"We would pick up our scales and go to the place and check not only the product in question, but the entire meat counter to see if this is a systemic problem," he said. Jackson added that inspectors would also immediately remove any meats that violated the regulations.The CFIA says it didn't need to visit any Loblaw stores because the grocer reported it had fixed the error. about food weight accuracy, launched by the CFIA this week, the agency says its inspectors "regularly go on site" for investigations.Jackson also says that when he was on the job, inspectors frequently did routine inspections in grocery stores to ensure food was weighed accurately. He and several other former CFIA inspectors told CBC News the agency now does too few of these types of inspections."It's not a great time for rigorous oversight of consumer fraud protection," said Jackson, who is now director of policy and strategy with the Consumers Council of Canada.CFIA spokesperson Patrick Girard said in an email that the agency "works every day to protect consumers" from mislabelled food by doing inspections, surveillance, responding to complaints and raising awareness.The CFIA said that it did 125 planned inspections in the past year for weight accuracy. When asked how many of them were done in grocery stores, the agency replied that such data isn't available.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Learned from mistakes</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1i92kkw/learned_from_mistakes/</link><author>/u/Lillian_La_Elara_</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 18:39:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[So yesterday was deffenetly a day... i had a good working KDE Setup but of course the kind of person i am i had to fiddle around, i see all these beautifull Hyprland setups, thought i try to install it, make it look pretty, that didn't work out.

You suddenly come across the following remark: “…since  and  are eigenvectors of  with distinct eigenvalues, they are linearly independent.” Wait—how does the proof go? You should really know this. Here  and  are nonzero elements of a vector space  and  is a linear map. You force yourself to pick up a pen and write down the following argument:Let  and  with  Suppose  Applying  and using linearity, we have  Multiplying the original equation by  we have  Subtracting the two yields  and since  and  are nonzero, we have  The corresponding argument with  and  swapped yields  so the only linear combination of  and  that yields  is the trivial one.Your colleagues have all gone home and there is nobody around to discuss this with. So, instead, you turn to your computer and start up Lean, the proof assistant you happen to use. Can you prove the claim formally? As you type, the information window in your editor complains about every misstep—the syntax is fiddly, and you have to get the notation and the instructions just right—but that’s okay, because working through the proof is relaxing and kind of fun. Lean often makes you spell out arguments that are painfully obvious, but you have found that if you set things up just right, it will cheerfully fill in some of the details. After a short while, you have success! Lean signs off on the proof, confirming you have managed to construct a formal derivation in the system’s axiomatic foundation.import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.LinearIndependent

    _ = 0 := by simp [hab]
  simp_all [sub_eq_zero]What a lovely proof! It took some effort to work it out, but it was a pleasure seeing the steps play out formally, and you are proud of the result.Let’s take a look at what you have done. You are using Lean’s mathematical library, Mathlib, a communally developed and maintained repository of formally verified mathematics. At the time of writing, Mathlib contains more than 80,000 definitions and more than 160,000 theorems, starting from axiomatic primitives and developing mathematics from the bottom up. It also contains dozens of user-contributed automated reasoning procedures that help with the formalization process, as well as notation declarations and configuration information, all of which codify different aspects of our mathematical understanding.To avoid having to load the entire library into memory at once, Lean asks you to tell the system what parts of the library you want to use. So the first line of the proof, the one that starts with the keyword , tells Lean you want to use the file with the name shown. That pulls in all the files in the library that those notions depend on, which is quite a lot, including basic algebra, properties of scalars and vectors, and so on.The next line, the one that begins with the word , declares some of the objects you want to work with: a field,  and a vector space,  You could have, alternatively, put these declarations after the  keyword on line 5; using the  command to declare them separately is especially convenient when multiple definitions and theorems share the same data and hypotheses. It’s a quirk of the library’s design that you declare that  is an additive, commutative, group, coupled with a scalar action that turns  into a  (Remember, a vector space is nothing more than a module over a ring in which the ring in question is actually a field.) Mathlib includes thousands of axiomatically declared structures, and the contributors to the library take great care to maximize reusability by breaking structural hypotheses into reusable pieces that can easily be configured and composed.Next comes the keyword  (line 5), which indicates that the result you are proving is not intended for future use. Using  is good for experimentation. To prove a lemma or theorem that you intend to use later, you would instead use  or  and provide a name. In that case, once Lean has processed the proof, it is stored in the , which means that any file that imports this one can see it. If you think you have proved a theorem that ought to go into Mathlib, you can issue a  to add it to the library. Mathlib is overseen by teams of  and  who moderate and update the contents, ensuring the quality and stability of the library.You begin stating the claim by introducing the key players:a linear map  from  to itself. Lean’s notation for such linear maps is ,two elements of  denoted  and  which will end up being your eigenvalues, and a hypothesis called  that says  and  are distinct,two vectors called  and  as well as hypotheses  and  that say that they are nonzero,and, finally, your two key assumptions,  and , which say that  and In the notation , the  is a fixed symbol signifying linear maps, whereas the parameter in brackets indicates that we mean linearity over .At this point, you have set up your , that is, the data and hypotheses you need to state your claim. You have your  space  a linear map  two scalars  and  and eigenvectors  and  for  and  respectively. At that point you are ready to state the conclusion (lines 9 and 10), namely, that  and  are linearly independent: . You have decided to use the definition of linear independence for a pair of vectors: Whenever  and  are scalars, if  then  and Notice that you have used the symbol  in expressions like  (line 7) to express that  and  are elements of , rather than writing  and . In Lean’s axiomatic foundation, a version of , every object has a fundamental data type. In this example, we would say that that  and  are  of the  Interestingly, we use the same notation in an expression like  (also line 7) to express that  is a label for the assumption . In dependent type theory, assertions like  (also known as ) are analogous to data types, and they are handled by the same fundamental mechanisms. Lean checks that an expression like  is a well-formed expression of type , given information about the variables and symbols involved, and, in the same way, it checks that a formal expression is a well-formed proof of the proposition , given the data and assumptions it depends on. That is why the latter appears after the colon in the example’s conclusion: the statement of the example announces your intent to construct a formal proof of the conclusion, given the data and assumptions that come before.What comes after the symbol  (line 10) is the proof itself, or, more precisely, instructions that tell Lean how to construct the proof. If you are successful, the corresponding expression is stored in memory and checked for correctness by Lean’s trusted . The keyword  after the  instructs Lean to enter , which means that the text that follows should be interpreted as a list of instructions that tell Lean how to build the required proof. A  is a procedure that automatically fills in a chain of formal inferences that is needed to justify a reasoning step. Such a chain can be as short as a single logical axiom or rule, but it can also be quite long and involved. Tactics thus play an important role in bridging the gap between the kind of reasoning that is intuitively clear and natural to mathematicians and the stringent axiomatic rules embodied by a formal system.The first tactic you use is  (line 11). This introduces the two variables ,  which your statement quantifies over, as well as the antecedent of the implication, that is, the assumption . As you type or move your cursor around a proof, Lean displays the , i.e., information that is relevant at that point in the proof, in its  window. After the  tactic, the tactic state looks something like this:K : Type
V : Type
f : V →ₗ[K] V
μ ν : K
hμν : μ ≠ ν
x y : V
hx₀ : x ≠ 0
hy₀ : y ≠ 0
hx : f x = μ • x
hy : f y = ν • y
a b : K
hab : a • x + b • y = 0
⊢ a = 0 ∧ b = 0This is nice a summary of where you are in the proof, including the objects and assumptions you started with as well as the objects ,  and the assumption  that you introduced in the first step. The line that starts with  indicates that your current  is to prove the conjunction .While writing the proof, you notice that Lean complains with warnings and error messages. This is expected, since the proof is incomplete. You can appease Lean by apologizing for the incomplete proof: If you use the  tactic on the final line of the proof, Lean will not raise an error over the fact that the proof is incomplete, but it will still raise a gentle warning about the use of .The next step in the proof starts with  (line 12). This introduces a calculation, similar to a  block in LaTeX. The calculation itself is very similar to the one in the proof sketch above, but notice that the individual steps in the calculation are justified by short subproofs like  (line 15) or  (line 17). The  tactic proves equalities of universal linear expressions, in other words, linear equalities that are true in all modules, and do not use specific facts about the module at hand. The  tactic is a powerful tool that uses a database of equalities and equivalences from Mathlib, together with user-specified equations (like ) to rewrite its goal into a simpler form. Happily, in this case, the goal becomes a trivial equality, and the goal is therefore closed. In a moment, we will consider the steps that  has taken in greater detail.After this calculation, you completed your proof with the  tactic (line 19), which is a variant of  that recursively uses all the hypotheses to simplify all hypotheses and the goal. Now if you leave a  after the , Lean will complain that there is nothing to be sorry about and insist that remove the apology. Lean checks the correctness of the proof and confirms it with its silence: the absence of errors is the proclamation that you have succeeded.So what exactly does the  tactic do? The following provides a manual, more detailed proof of one step of the calculation in your proof, with the direction of the equality reversed.variable (f : V →ₗ[K] V)
  (μ ν : K) (x y : V) (a b : K)

example (hx : f x = μ • x) (hy : f y = ν • y) :
  f (a • x + b • y) = (a • μ • x + b • ν • y) := by
calc f (a • x + b • y)
    = f (a • x) + f (b • y) := by
        rw [map_add]
  _ = a • f x + b • f y := by
        rw [map_smul, map_smul]
  _ = (a • μ • x + b • ν • y) := by
        rw [hx, hy]This example demonstrates the  tactic, denoted . In the calculation, we first rewrite with the lemma , which states that for any linear map , the equation  holds. The next step in the calculation is justified by rewriting twice with the lemma , which states that for any linear map , scalar , and vector , the equation  holds. (Here  stands for “scalar multiplication.”) The underscores before each subsequent step are part of the  syntax, indicating to the parser that the calculation continues. The proof concludes by rewriting with the hypotheses  and , which assert that  and  are eigenvectors of  with eigenvalues  and  respectively.The lemmas  and  are part of the Mathlib library, and they are labeled with the . This attribute tells Lean that the lemma should be added to the database of lemmas that  uses to simplify expressions. And that is the reason why the  tactic could prove the goal in one go: it chained together the  steps that we spelled out step by step in the calculation above.One of the challenges of formalization is that we often need to spell out, in painful detail, inferences that seem obvious or straightforward to us. The more we can get the computer to fill in, the better. The simplifier is an important example of  that can help in this respect. The  tactic is another.Broadly speaking, there are two classes of automation. Firstly, there is  automation. One example that we have seen is the  tactic, the simplifier. Another example is , a tactic that provides “Automated Extensible Search for Obvious Proofs.” In the proof assistant Isabelle, there is a tool called , which can search for proofs using a large database of lemmas. And recently AI copilots have demonstrated the ability to suggest tactics and fill in parts of proofs in Lean. The wide applicability of these general-purpose tools is balanced by the fact that, at least for now, they can only assist with proofs that are relatively straightforward.The other class of automation is  automation. Here we have also seen an example: the  tactic. Other examples include the  tactic, which solves equations in commutative rings, the  tactic, which solves linear arithmetic problems, and the  tactic, which proves that functions satisfy a given property such as “continuity” or “measurability.” These tactics are less general; they typically have a well-defined and narrow scope, but they can be very powerful in their domain of applicability. A prime example of this approach comes from the use of software tools known as SAT solvers and SMT solvers: if a claim can be encoded as a boolean formula or a formula in some decidable theory, then these can be used to justify it automatically. This has been fruitfully applied in non-trivial ways, see for example .Often, one of the first things we do when we have proved a lemma or a theorem is check whether the hypotheses can be weakened, in order to increase its applicability. Proof assistants are especially helpful in this respect, because they enable us to tinker with hypotheses interactively and see what breaks. Returning to our example, upon verifying the initial result, you might wonder: what are the minimal assumptions that we need to make this proof go through? Let’s experiment. The proof never mentions inverses of scalars, so it should work for a larger class of rings. In a first attempt, we might try to replace the vector space  by an arbitrary module  as follows:variable {R M : Type}
  [Ring R] [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]But Lean complains at the first step in the calculation, which requires . We can address this by assuming that the ring of scalars is commutative. However, after making that change, the final step of the proof is still broken. A bit of reflection shows that this step uses the result of the calculation steps together with the assumptions  and  to prove that . In other words, we need the additional property that  implies that  or  for every  in  and  in . Mathlib expresses this as the property , and we can add that assumption as follows:variable {R M : Type}
  [CommRing R] [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]
  [NoZeroSMulDivisors R M]

example (f : M →ₗ[R] M)
  (μ ν : R) (hμν : μ ≠ ν)
  (x y : M) (hx₀ : x ≠ 0) (hy₀ : y ≠ 0)
  (hx : f x = μ • x) (hy : f y = ν • y) :
  ∀ a b : R, a • x + b • y = 0 → a = 0 ∧ b = 0Lean accepts this statement with the same proof as before! We have therefore obtained a more general theorem without changing a single character of the proof.Let’s see if we can strengthen your result even further. You started with a basic version involving vector spaces over fields and only two eigenvectors, and we just generalized it to suitable modules over commutative rings. Where can we go from here?Let’s try to generalize the theorem to arbitrary families of eigenvectors. To do this, we will need to think carefully about how to express, in Lean, the fact that an arbitrary family of vectors is linearly independent. We could write down a definition from scratch, but it makes sense to see if we can take advantage of things that are already in the library. If we navigate to the Mathlib documentation webpage ⁠ and start typing  in the search box, one of the first few results that comes up is the following:def LinearIndependent {ι : Type}
  (R : Type) {M : Type}
  (v : ι → M) [Semiring R]
  [AddCommMonoid M] [Module R M] :
  PropHere  and  are the relevant ring and module, as before,  is an indexing type, and  is a family of elements of  indexed by . It is standard, and convenient, to represent a family  of elements of  as a function , in which case the  element,  is simply written . All the arguments in curly and square brackets are generally left implicit, which is to say, we expect to write  and have Lean figure out the rest. The annotation  means that the expression  is a proposition, namely, the proposition that the family  is linearly independent over . At the moment, we don’t need to know the body of the definition; we can use it as a black box.To do so, we will add an indexing type  to the statement of our theorem, and since we also want to say that the vectors are all , we will also use  to index a family  of scalars which will act as the eigenvalues. We can now formulate the statement we are after as follows:example {R M : Type} [CommRing R]
    [AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]
    [NoZeroSMulDivisors R M]
    (f : M →ₗ[R] M)
    (μ : ι → R) (hμ : Function.Injective μ)
    (v : ι → M) (hv : ∀ i, v i ≠ 0)
    (h : ∀ i, f (v i) = μ i • v i) :
    LinearIndependent R vNote that we have formulated the fact that we are considering  eigenvalues by assuming  is injective.We should check to see whether something like this theorem is already in the library. If we go back to the documentation webpage and search for , only two results come up:theorem

  LinearIndependent R vThe difference between the two is that the first is about a set of scalars and a function assigning an eigenvector to each scalar, whereas the second one is about indexed families of scalars and eigenvectors. The second one is more promising for our application, since we also chose to use indexed families of vectors and scalars. To use this theorem to prove our version, we invoke the  tactic.example {R M : Type} [CommRing R]

  apply Module.End.eigenvectors_linearIndependent'This leaves us with a number of goals:, asking us to prove that something is injective., which looks like it should have something to do with our assumptions  and ., asking us to provide an endomorphism of  this should just be our linear map .And finally, , which will be our The  in the first two goals and the  in the second goal mean that Lean does not yet know how to instantiate the variables  and  in the theorem we have invoked. It left those tasks as the third and fourth goals; Lean expects that it will be more convenient for us to provide that information implicitly when we solve the other goals.We have made progress, but we still need to provide the information requested. We should clearly use  to solve the first goal, which we do by adding the next line to our proof:apply Module.End.eigenvectors_linearIndependent'

As a side effect, that also closes goal 4: Lean is now able to infer that the family in question is  We then have two goals left:, andWe know that the endomorphism of  should be  so we swap the order of the goals and give Lean this information:apply Module.End.eigenvectors_linearIndependent'

This makes progress, but we still have the following goals to fulfill:, which is obviously an application of .For 1, the hypothesis  should do the trick, but applying it directly doesn’t work. After digging into the details, we see that this is because the eigenspace of  with respect to a scalar  is defined as the kernel of  so we will need to convert  to this form. We could do this manually, but we can first check whether we can use a preexisting lemma from the library. The fastest way to do this, in the middle of a Lean proof, is to try the  tactic. This will do a search for ways of applying existing lemmas to close the goal . This tactic doesn’t always work, but it can’t hurt to try. Aha! In this case it tells us right away that we can close the first goal by writing . The second goal is also easy to close by applying , so now we have a complete proof:apply Module.End.eigenvectors_linearIndependent'

  · apply hvThe  tactic now supplies , , and  right away, leaving only one remaining goal.We have thus achieved the level of generality we were after. Should this theorem be added to Mathlib? Upon consideration, we should conclude that our theorem is not substantially different from . In our proof, we only added some plumbing and changed the way we talk about eigenvectors to match the theorem in the library. Now that we know about , it seems that this is the standard way to talk about eigenvectors in Mathlib. If we were to modify our statement to use this instead of our bespoke  and , our theorem would be a direct application of . In other words, we have come to realize that the theorem in the library is what we really wanted all along. But the good news is that we have learned a lot in the process, and we are now much more comfortable reasoning about linear independence and eigenvectors with Mathlib.Programmers and computer scientists have long made use of  platforms like GitHub to work on large, collaborative software projects. Formalization has brought the same tools and methodologies to mathematics. At the time of writing, Mathlib comprises approximately 5,000 files and 1.5 million lines, written by over 300 contributors. These contributions go through an open review process on GitHub, before they are merged into the main repository. In total there have been a bit more than 30,000 contributions since Mathlib’s inception in 2017.A nice thing about version control tools is that they maintain the entire history of the project, allowing us to see what has changed and when. For example, we can trace the history of the concept of “linear independence” in Mathlib. It all started on December 7, 2017, when Johannes Hölzl committed⁠ the file  to the repository. The file was 708 lines long, and on line 186 it contained a definition of linear independence.def linear_independent (s : set β) : Prop :=
  ∀ l : lc α β, (∀x∉s, l x = 0) →
    l.sum (λv c, c • v) = 0 → l = 0The terms  quantify over , the type of all linear combinations of elements of  with coefficients in .On March 10, 2018, an administrative operation⁠ moved  out of  so that it became a top-level folder. Another such move occurred on January 15, 2019, when Simon Hudon moved⁠ all the mathematical content into  to separate it from the tests and other auxiliary files.On July 3, 2019, Alexander Bentkamp morphed⁠ the definition intodef linear_independent : Prop :=
  (finsupp.total ι M R v).ker = ⊥In other words, a collection of vectors  in  is linearly independent if the natural map from the free module generated by the vectors  to  has trivial kernel.Then, on October 5, 2020, Anne Baanen split⁠ linear independence and the accumulated supporting theory into a separate file: . The file was 918 lines long. The story continued on February 23, 2023, when Pol’tta / Miyahara Kō ported⁠ the file to Lean 4 as part of a massive collaborative effort to move all of Mathlib to the new version of Lean. The filename is now , and it lives in the new  repository on GitHub. The definition has not changed substantially since the change by Bentkamp. At the time of writing, it reads as follows:def LinearIndependent : Prop :=
  LinearMap.ker (Finsupp.total ι M R v) = ⊥The earliest programs for checking mathematical proofs include Nicolaas de Bruijn’s Automath system, launched in 1967, and Andrzej Trybulec’s Mizar system, launched in 1973. Since then, dozens of proof assistants have been developed; Coq, Isabelle, and HOL Light are among the more prominent ones still in use today. The Lean project, launched by Leonardo de Moura in 2013, is a relative newcomer. A special issue of the , with articles by John Harrison , Thomas Hales , and Freek Wiedijk , surveyed the state of the field in 2008. We have come a long way since then.Proof assistants are now commonly used in industry to verify hardware, software, network protocols, cryptographic protocols, cyberphysical systems, and more. Mathematicians have only recently begun to embrace the technology, and it is becoming clear that there are several benefits to representing mathematics in digital form. Just as the word processor opened up new opportunities for written expression and communication, the digitization of mathematics opens up new opportunities for mathematical research and teaching.⁠ The practical benefits are not the only motivation; to many of us, formalizing mathematics feels like the right thing to do. Mathematical definitions and theorems  to be rendered digitally.It is also becoming clear that the technology is here to stay. Mathlib currently has roughly 1.5 million lines of code and continues to grow. Important results, including foundations for Clausen and Scholze’s condensed mathematics,⁠ the polynomial Freiman–Ruzsa conjecture,⁠ and an exponentially improved upper bound to Ramsey’s theorem,⁠ have been formally verified before journal referees signed off on them. A number of collaborative verification projects have been launched, including a proof of the sphere eversion theorem⁠ and a proof of a strengthened version of Carlson’s theorem on pointwise almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series.⁠We expect that, in the years to come, AI copilots that combine neural and symbolic methods will significantly ease the burden of formalization. More dramatically, we expect that the technology we have discussed here will play a significant role in the discovery of new mathematics. Note that DeepMind’s AlphaProof, which was deemed to have performed at the level of a silver medalist at the most recent International Mathematical Olympiad,⁠ was trained to find formal proofs in Lean. It is exciting to think about what a synergetic combination of machine learning, symbolic methods, and user interaction will bring to mathematics in the years ahead.You can find online documentation and tutorials for all the proof assistants we have just mentioned. Lean’s lively social media channel on the Zulip platform is welcoming to newcomers, and the Lean community web pages contain links⁠ to learning resources, like the Natural Number Game, to help you get started. Proof assistants are not easy to use, and learning to formalize mathematics requires significant time and effort. Interaction with proof assistants like Lean comes naturally, however, to those who have grown up immersed in computational technology. We have therefore found that one of the best ways to take advantage of proof assistants is to have our students help us out. Formal mathematics is a language, and only they can claim to be among the first generation of native speakers, while the rest of us struggle to master the grammar and intonation.With all the changes looming, we ought to be concerned about the ways that proof assistants and AI will change the mathematics that we know and love. It is therefore all the more important for those of us who are more settled in our careers to play an active role in the adoption of the new technologies, using our mathematical values and expertise to guide our students as they negotiate the changing landscape. The new developments offer us a wonderful opportunity to lead from behind, and it falls on all of us to support the next generation of mathematicians as they forge a path into the digital future.We are grateful to the Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics for hosting three of us for the trimester program, “Prospects of Formal Mathematics,” in the summer of 2024, during which most of this article was written.

Note that while the bound on the number of losses and ties we incur is exponential, the runtime can be considered efficient since choosing which action to play in each round is efficient; this is an improvement over the simple general prediction algorithm we considered in section 3, which requires considering an exponential number of game matrices to choose which action to play in a single round.

From a report: An international team of researchers has estimated that an electric car will have a lifespan of 18.4 years, compared with 18.7 years for petrol cars and 16.8 years for diesels, according to a peer-reviewed study published on Friday in the journal Nature Energy. The findings were based on 300m records from compulsory annual MOT tests of roadworthiness. 

Automotive engineers have long suspected electric cars will be more reliable than petrol or diesel cars, because they contain many fewer moving parts. Data has been limited, however, because the earliest mass-market electric cars are only just reaching the end of their lives. The researchers, from the University of Birmingham, the London School of Economics, the University of California San Diego, and the University of Bern, Switzerland, used MOT data to estimate the failure rate of all cars -- ignoring scrappage in the first few years, which is most likely to be related to accidents. The analysis found that Tesla cars had the longest lifespan among battery cars.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Subpixel Snake [video]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDwganLjpW0</link><author>codetrotter</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:21:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Right now, ongoing protest against pro Russian government in Slovakia / Bratislava</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1i90li8/right_now_ongoing_protest_against_pro_russian/</link><author>/u/vladoportos</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:19:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kodiak has made its first driverless truck deliveries to customer Atlas Energy</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/kodiak-has-made-its-first-driverless-truck-deliveries-to-customer-atlas-energy/</link><author>Rebecca Bellan</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:11:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kodiak Robotics has officially handed off two autonomous trucks to customer Atlas Energy Solutions, marking the startup’s first commercial launch.  Atlas, a provider of proppant (i.e., sand) and oilfield logistics, received its first Kodiak-equipped trucks in December and began driverless operations in an off-road environment in West Texas’s remote Permian Basin shortly after.

 (Permissible Game). We refer to a game with the above properties as a permissible game for convenience.\
We consider how well we can do without knowing the payoff matrix M or even observing payoffs when playing against a behaviorally-biased opponent who does know M. Our goal will be to win nearly every round.2.1 Models of behaviorally-biased opponentsWe assume all opponents know the payoff matrix and play a deterministic, behaviorallybiased strategy. The following are the particular biased adversaries we consider here:\
The opponent plays a best response to our last action. If there are multiple best responses to our last action, we assume the opponent breaks ties according to some fixed but unknown order over actions. On the first round, since there is no previous action, we assume the opponent plays the first action in that ordering.\
This is our simplest opponent, who just assumes that tomorrow will be exactly like today.\
e opponent plays a best response to our “most overdue” (least-frequently-played) action. This opponent is motivated by the Gambler’s Fallacy, in which one assumes an event which hasn’t happened as often as expected is “overdue” and is more likely to occur (for example, when tossing a fair coin, the belief that Tails is more likely following a series of Heads).\
If there are multiple best responses to our “most overdue” action, or if there are multiple “most overdue” actions the opponent might try to counter (for example, at the start of the game when all actions are equally “overdue” since they have all been played zero times), the opponent breaks ties using a fixed but unknown order over actions.\
The opponent continues to play the same action following a win, and switches to a new action following a loss. We consider two variants of this strategy: one in which the opponent behaves as if a tie is a win, continuing to play the same action after tying, and one in which the opponent behaves as if a tie is a loss, switching actions after tying.\
We assume that when the opponent shifts actions, they shift to the action immediately following the current action in some fixed but unknown order over actions. In the first round, we assume the opponent plays the first action in that ordering.\
Win-stay lose-shift was initially proposed as an early algorithm for bandit problems by Robbins [15]. There is also some empirical research indicating that people may play rock-paper-scissors according to an approximate version of this strategy: Wang et al. [19] observed that players are more likely to play the same action again after winning, and more likely to shift to the next action in the sequence rock-paper-scissors following a loss. More broadly, win-stay lose-shift has been proposed as a potential explanation for the evolution of cooperative behavior [13].\
This strategy can also be viewed as similar to the hot-hand fallacy, in which one believes an action which has just won is having a “hot streak” and is more likely to win in the future, and conversely believes an action which has just lost is having a “cold” streak and is more likely to lose in the future.\
The opponent plays the best action in retrospect, where the best action in retrospect is the action that would have achieved the highest net payoff against our history of play. If multiple actions are tied for the highest payoff, the opponent breaks ties using some fixed but unknown order over actions. In the first round, when there is no history to choose based on, the opponent plays the first action in that ordering.\
It has been hypothesized that irrational strategic behavior may be explained by agents playing a misspecified or simplified version of a game rationally [7]. The above strategy is reasonable for an opponent who erroneously models our play as stochastic. In online learning, this strategy is called Follow-the-Leader or FTL (see [16]).\
We also consider a limited-history variant of this opponent, in which the the opponent only considers the last r rounds, where r > 0.\
The opponent plays the action that has achieved the highest average payoff over the times they have played it. We assume the opponent initializes the average payoff of each action as 0. If multiple actions are tied for the highest average payoff, the opponent breaks ties using some fixed but unknown order over actions.\
This is a reasonable strategy for an opponent who believes our play is stochastic, in which case its actions can be viewed as coins with various biases. It also corresponds to a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, epsilon-greedy Q-learning, with ϵ = 0 (see [17]).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ways to Counter Limited-History Opponents with Algorithmic Tools</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ways-to-counter-limited-history-opponents-with-algorithmic-tools?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.A.2 Follow-the-Leader Variant: Limited HistoryRecall that the limited-history variant of the Follow-the-Leader opponent plays the action that would have achieved the highest net payoff against the last r rounds of our play. Note that we assume r > 0. If r = 0, the opponent would simply play the same action every round (the first action in their action ordering) regardless of our play. In that case, their play would not reveal any information about best responses, so the best we could do is tie in most rounds by playing the same action as the opponent.\
We again use the ellipsoid algorithm for prediction, essentially the same way as described for the unlimited-history variant of this opponent in 4.4. In this case, the inequality we observe when a mistake is made is only relative to the past r rounds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Future Directions for Exploiting Behavioral Biases in Games</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/future-directions-for-exploiting-behavioral-biases-in-games?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.In future work, it would be interesting to further characterize which behaviorally-biased strategies can be exploited to win nearly every round without observing payoffs. In that vein, one clear next step would be to explore the exploitability of behaviorally-motivated probabilistic strategies. In the probabilistic setting it may not be possible to win even most of the time; for example, probabilistic strategies could be regret-minimizing, in which case the best we can hope to achieve is the minimax value of the game. However, we could aim to get bounds on our performance relative to the best possible strategy given full information about the game matrix, payoffs, and the opponent’s strategy. Another direction would be considering more complex games, for example exploring extensive-form games.\

Clearly, if we can predict the opponent’s actions and learn best responses to those actions the opponent plays, we can achieve this goal.\
Predicting the Opponent’s Actions\
The more challenging question is which deterministic strategies we can exploit to learn best responses for any action the opponent might play. Note that we cannot do this for every deterministic strategy; consider a very simple opponent who always plays the same action a. In this case, the opponent’s play does not reveal any information about a best response to a.\
It is not always possible to exploit a known deterministic strategy to guarantee winning any rounds.\
Note that not every reasonable behavioral strategy has this property; several of the biased opponents we discussed earlier do not: the Gambler’s Fallacy opponent, the Tie-Stay variant of Win-Stay Lose-Shift opponent, and the Highest Average Payoff opponent.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Behavioral Biases Shape Gameplay Without Payoff Visibility</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-behavioral-biases-shape-gameplay-without-payoff-visibility?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.Strategies for Beating Behaviorally Biased OpponentsGameplay under various forms of uncertainty has been widely studied. Feldman et al. [8] studied a particularly low-information setting in which one observes the opponent’s actions but no payoffs, not even one’s own, and introduced an algorithm which guarantees one’s payoff nonetheless approaches the minimax optimal value (i.e., zero) in a symmetric zero-sum game. Against an opponent playing a minimax-optimal strategy, approaching the value of the game is the best one can hope to guarantee. However, a wealth of research in behavioral economics shows that people often do not make perfectly rational, optimal decisions. Here we consider whether it is possible to actually win in this setting if the opponent is behaviorally biased. We model several deterministic, biased opponents and show that even without knowing the game matrix in advance or observing any payoffs, it is possible to take advantage of each bias in order to win nearly every round (so long as the game has the property that each action beats and is beaten by at least one other action). We also provide a partial characterization of the kinds of biased strategies that can be exploited to win nearly every round, and provide algorithms for beating some kinds of biased strategies even when we don’t know which strategy the opponent uses.Game theory has traditionally assumed all agents are perfectly rational utility maximizers [14], but behavioral economics shows this assumption is often unsound; people often deviate from “optimal” behavior in predictable ways, exhibiting behavioral biases such as loss aversion (exhibiting a higher sensitivity to losses than equivalent gains) and confirmation bias (interpreting information in a way which favors existing beliefs) [10, 4]. These insights initiated the study of behavioral game theory, which has demonstrated that people employ consistent “irrational” strategies in wide-ranging strategic settings (see [3]). Given the evidence that people often use behavioral strategies in games, it is important to understand the implications of this in algorithmic interactions (see, e.g., [9, 1, 6, 12]).\
In this work, we are interested in the extent to which behavioral biases are vulnerable to exploitation in competitive games. To study this, we consider symmetric, repeated, two-player, zero-sum games, and find that even an uninformed opponent who does not know the game or observe any payoffs can take advantage of a wide variety of biased strategies to beat the biased player in nearly every round.\
The setting we consider here is based on work by Feldman et al. [8]. Gameplay under various forms of uncertainty is a focus of much research interest; for example, the bandit setting, in which a player observes payoffs after each round but not the opponent’s play, has been widely studied (see [2, 5]). Feldman et al. introduced a complementary setting, in which the player observes the opponent’s play but no payoffs. No assumptions are made about the opponent, who may have full knowledge of the game. In particular, Feldman et al. consider symmetric, two-player, repeated games. They introduce a “copycat” algorithm which guarantees a payoff approaching the value of the game, which is the best bound one could hope to achieve against an opponent playing a minimax-optimal strategy. For a symmetric zero-sum game, the value of the game is zero, so their algorithm guarantees a payoff approaching zero in that case. The Copycat algorithm basically works by ensuring that for any pair of actions a1 and a2, the number of rounds in which the uninformed player plays a1 and the opponent plays a2 is not very far from the number of rounds in which the player plays a2 and the opponent plays a1. In this way, the uninformed player is able to achieve roughly the value of the game without knowing (or learning) anything about payoffs.\
The setting introduced by Feldman et al. [8] is a particularly interesting setting in which to study behavioral bias, because it allows us to consider to what extent one can exploit an opponent’s biases when the opponent’s behavior is essentially the only information one has. We consider the same basic setting, with a few additional restrictions. Like Feldman et al., we consider repeated, two-player, zero-sum, symmetric games in a setting where one does not have a priori knowledge of the game matrix and does not observe payoffs, but does observe the opponents actions. We also assume the opponent is deterministic and plays according to some behaviorally-biased strategy. For simplicity, we consider games where payoffs are limited to {1, 0, -1} (just wins, ties and losses). We assume no action is unbeatable and each action beats at least one other action.\
There are two technical components to beating a biased opponent in this setting: one needs to learn to predict the opponent’s actions, and one needs to learn a best response to those actions the opponent plays. We note that it is not sufficient to just be able to predict accurately. For example, one natural idea which does not work (even if one is willing to take exponential time) is to simply find the lexicographically first game matrix consistent with all the opponent’s actions so far and their behavioral strategy, and then play a best response to the action predicted by that game matrix. It is possible that two game matrices, M1 and M2, could be consistent with the opponent’s play, but playing best responses with respect to M1 could result in losing most rounds (and tying in the remaining rounds) if the true game matrix is M2. We show such an example in section 3.\
We model several deterministic, behaviorally-biased opponents, and show how to exploit each bias to win nearly every round. We also give a partial characterization of the kinds of behavioral strategies we can exploit in general, and show that in some cases, we can also win nearly every round against a biased opponent even if we do not know which behavioral strategy they use.\
This work highlights the danger of using behaviorally-biased strategies in competitive settings. We might expect that, while such strategies are not minimax optimal, some seemingly reasonable ones might do well enough, particularly against an uninformed opponent. However, our work shows that some behavioral biases can be exploited even by a player without prior knowledge of the game matrix entries who does not observe payoffs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Methods for Decoding Opponent Actions and Optimizing Responses</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/methods-for-decoding-opponent-actions-and-optimizing-responses?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.3. Preliminaries and IntuitionWhile the strategy of playing action i against action j roughly as many times as we play action j against action i (for all i, j) employed by the Copycat algorithm in Feldman et al. [8] is sufficient to roughly tie in a symmetric zero-sum game, we’d like to go further and win nearly every round. To do this, we will learn to predict the opponent’s actions and learn best responses to those actions the opponent plays. It turns out that predicting the opponent’s actions is the “easy” part, and the main challenge will be learning best responses. We discuss each of these at a high level below.Predicting the Opponent’s ActionsIt is possible to learn to predict any of our opponents’ actions using a simple halving algorithm (see [11]). Recall that in our setting, an opponent’s choice of action is deterministic and induced by their known biased strategy, their tie-breaking mechanism, the unknown game matrix, and the history of play. Consider all possible combinations of the opponent’s known biased strategy with a potential tie-breaking mechanism to be a family of deterministic strategies. Then, consider all possible pairs including a deterministic strategy from that family and a game matrix of the appropriate size. Predict the opponent’s next action by taking the majority vote over the predictions corresponding to these pairs and the play history. Then, eliminate all pairs that did not correspond to a correct prediction. Each time a mistake is made, at least half of the remaining pairs must have predicted incorrectly, so at least half of the remaining pairs are eliminated. Given a finite number of possible tiebreaking mechanisms, this algorithm clearly results in a finite number of prediction errors. However, it is inefficient: even with our assumption of only 3 possible payoff values, there are roughly 3 n 2 possible game matrices, and for each game matrix, there may be many tiebreaking mechanisms to consider: throughout this paper we generally assume the opponent breaks ties according to some fixed ordering over actions, in which case there are n!. We will give more efficient prediction algorithms for each of the opponents we introduced above by taking further advantage of their specific strategies.\
It may seem like being able to predict generally is sufficient to learn best responses, but this is not the case. For example, a general (exponential) algorithm which does not work is to find the lexicographically first game matrix and action ordering pair consistent with all the opponent’s actions so far and their behavioral strategy, and then play a best response to the action predicted by that pair according to the corresponding game matrix. However, even for the simplest opponent we consider, the Myopic Best Responder, and identical orderings over actions, there could be two game matrices M and M∗ which are consistent with the opponent’s play, but playing best responses with respect to M could result in losing most rounds (and tying in the remaining rounds) if the true game matrix is M∗ (see the example below). Instead, we will more actively exploit the opponent’s particular strategy to elicit best responses.\
Example: Playing Optimally According to a Consistent Game Matrix and Action Ordering is Not Sufficient to Win\
Action Ordering Ω: R, P, S, R’, P’, S’\
Suppose we are playing a game M∗ against the Myopic Best Responder, whose ordering over actions is Ω. Suppose that we predict the Myopic Best Responder’s actions according to the correct action ordering Ω but a slightly different game matrix M, and play best responses according to M. Both games are like an expanded version of rock-paper-scissors, in which the interactions among R, P, S and among R’,P’, S’ respectively are the same as in standard rock-paper-scissors, but the interactions between those two sets of actions differs between M and M∗ ; the differing entries are bolded for convenience. Consider the following sequence of play, which is consistent with M∗ , M, Ω, and the strategy of the Myopic Best Responder, and optimal according to M:\
The sequence shown in the first three rounds will repeat indefinitely as long as we continue to play the same best responses with respect to M, leading us to lose or tie in every round.\
Note that it is possible to construct very similar, larger games in which we lose to the Myopic Best Responder an arbitrarily large fraction of the time (depending on the number of actions in the game), since we only need to tie against the first action in the opponent’s action ordering to avoid discovering any inconsistency.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Key to Defeating Win-Stay, Lose-Shift Opponent Variants</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-key-to-defeating-win-stay-lose-shift-opponent-variants?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.4.3 Win-Stay, Lose-Shift OpponentRecall that the Win-Stay Lose-Shift opponent plays the same action immediately following a win, and switches to the next action in its action ordering immediately following a loss. The Tie-Shift variant of this opponent treats a tie like a loss and shifts, and the Tie-Stay variant treats a tie like a win and stays.\
. In the first phase, we record the correct action ordering: the opponent starts by playing the first action in their action ordering and always shifts to the next action in the ordering, so by observing n − 1 shifts we observe all n actions in the correct order. Because we play each action in succession against the opponent’s current action, they are guaranteed to shift after at most n − 1 rounds, since their action must tie with itself and lose to at least one other action.\
At the start of phase 4, we correctly predict the opponent’s next action: we know we won the last round, so we know that the opponent will shift to the next action in its action order (which we have recorded correctly, as shown above). We showed above that we correctly recorded a best response to each action, so we win by playing the recorded best response to the predicted action. At the start of the next round, the same conditions hold (and will hold after each round), so we will win all subsequent rounds.The main difference in beating the Tie-Stay variant compared to the Tie-Shift variant is that we can find a best response to each action by simply playing each action in succession until the opponent switches, since they only switch following a loss. For the algorithm, theorem and proof see A.1 in the Appendix.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hydra Achieves 1 Million TPS, Validating Cardano as the Fastest Blockchain</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/hydra-achieves-1-million-tps-validating-cardano-as-the-fastest-blockchain?source=rss</link><author>Jon Stojan Journalist</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[\
The Hydra Doom Tournament is a high-stakes gaming event, held both online and live, that highlights the classic game Doom while demonstrating the scalability and capabilities of the Hydra solution on the Cardano blockchain. The first stages of the tournament have delivered decisive results, with  being crowned the fastest blockchain, achieving an unprecedented 1 million Transactions Per Second (TPS).\
This significant milestone positions Cardano at the forefront of blockchain scalability and could set a new precedent for the industry. Most importantly, Cardano has proven its capability for high scalability without compromising security or decentralization, reflecting the blockchain’s readiness to support high-demand applications across industries.\
Beyond the gaming industry, the Hydra Doom engine could transform P2P applications and business-to-business systems in all areas of tech.The Stress Test of the Hydra Doom TournamentThe Hydra Doom Tournament has served as a real-world stress test that pushed Hydra’s capabilities to the limit within a competitive environment. The players competed in regional qualifiers and semi-finals, and the tournament will conclude with an in-person finale held in Las Vegas.\
The large scale of the tournament showcased Hydra’s ability to process vast amounts of data in real-time transactions.Superior Tech Applications in Data ProcessingWithin the Hydra Doom Tournament, game data from players was submitted as smart contract transactions to individual Hydra heads. Each Hydra head then validated transactions using smart contracts that contained a subset of game logic and tracked the game state, including player scores.\
Providing this information via the blockchain made it possible to populate leaderboards and distribute prizes through verified smart contracts. Although video game competitions can typically take weeks to distribute prize money to winners, the Hydra Doom Tournament managed it within seconds.A Proving Ground for ScalabilityThe Hydra Doom Tournament demonstrates Hydra’s scalability prowess under live conditions. During the qualifier on December 3rd, thousands of players competed for spots, so the Hydra team decided to further supplement traffic with additional games running bot-vs-bot simulations.\
The number of transactions surpassed the previous total of 106 million over 78 hours during the Rare Evo event, reaching 15.5 billion transactions in just 24 hours. The semi-finals, held December 8–18, featured Player-Vs-Player death matches as competitors vied for spots in the finals.A Major Milestone for Blockchain TechnologyHydra’s success, proven by how rapidly it handled transactions throughout the Doom Tournament, has made Cardano much faster and more efficient. Hydra has distinguished itself from other blockchain systems through a number of advantages inherited from Cardano, including the EUTxO model, native assets, deterministic transaction execution, and high-assurance smart contracts.\
These benefits are taken to a new level with the application of the temporary head model.The Power of the Hydra HeadsHydra’s strength lies in its horizontal scaling capacity, in which as many Hydra heads as needed can be deployed in parallel. This grants Hydra the capability to take on large volumes, as proven on the Hydra Doom Tournament grounds.\
Theoretically, there is no upper limit to its scaling capacity for applications in this design type. The collaboration of multiple engineering teams and designers, including Sundae Labs, Adam Dean, DripDropz, and the Hydra team, has allowed for Hydra’s true potential to be unlocked and run in real time.\
What truly sets Hydra apart is the ingenuity of the temporary head model. Each Hydra head operator can enact trade-offs that wouldn’t be possible for persistent systems, such as setting transaction fees to zero, which allows for significantly larger and more complex transactions if needed.\
Perhaps most impressively, of the roughly 15.5 billion transactions processed within 24 hours on December 3, not a single one failed. This unprecedented reliability could set new benchmarks for the tech industry, with applications spanning multiple sectors.The Potential Applications of Cardano HydraHydra has already proven its potential in gaming through the Hydra Doom Tournament. Beyond processing transactions for these kinds of tournaments, it could also process microtransactions during gameplay with advanced speed and efficiency.\
These capabilities can be taken outside the gaming world as well, as it is uniquely suited for P2P applications within business-to-business systems. Broadening the category from the gaming angle, it can also be applied to “information gathering” applications, where the primary purpose is not to handle people’s assets but to collect cryptographically verified information such as signed messages.\
Furthermore, Hydra’s abilities could be utilized for banking and global payments, breaking financial barriers with faster cross-border transactions. Within the world of DeFi, Hydra could power decentralized applications to improve the user experience among a wide variety of other blockchain use cases.The Future Implications of Blockchain ProgressionEach milestone of blockchain progression increases the accessibility of blockchain technology for users and use cases. As this technology reaches new levels of sophistication, so does its potential to transform industries across tech.\
In terms of Hydra, it can be employed as a “friction remover” for practical day-to-day use. In its initial deployment phase, it can operate in a centralized model, then gradually change its structure to involve more node operators. Although Hydra is not the ultimate solution for every tech case, it can be combined with other products in the ecosystem to boost value for businesses and organizations.The Road Ahead for Cardano HydraThe next step for Hydra’s team is the conclusion of the Hydra Doom Tournament, which will take place on January 24, 2025 during the  at the Hyper X Arena in Las Vegas. In a final showdown, top players will compete for a total of $50,000 in prizes. This showcase event will place Hydra’s scalability on the global stage in true esports fashion.\
Beyond the tournament, the  team looks forward to the system’s official version 1 node launch. They also have numerous applications in the works that they will build with Hydra, including notable applications aimed at empowering DeFi use cases with Gummiworm from Sundae Labs and Delta DeFi.\
With the capabilities that Cardano Hydra has demonstrated so far, it is poised to take top spots in blockchain applications. Like its namesake, the multi-headed mythical beast, Hydra’s decentralized mode of operation makes it an exciting example of what DeFi has to offer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Strategies to Exploit Myopic and Gambler’s Fallacy Opponents</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/strategies-to-exploit-myopic-and-gamblers-fallacy-opponents?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.4.

Playing Algorithm 2 against the Myopic Best Responder in a permissible game (Definition 1) results in winning every round after the first n + 1 rounds.\
. The Myopic Best Responder plays a best response to our previous action, so we record a correct best response to each action during the first n + 1 rounds. The Myopic Best Responder always plays the same best response (the first one in its action ordering) following any given action, so we correctly predict the action it will play from round n + 2 onward. Therefore we win every round from round n + 2 onward, since we correctly predict the opponent’s action and play a valid best response to it.4.2 Gambler’s Fallacy Opponent\

For this opponent, our high-level strategy will be to learn a best response to each action, and then use the well-known ellipsoid algorithm to predict the opponent’s actions while playing best responses to the predicted actions.\
The round preceding such a switch must have been a loss for the opponent: its net payoff must have gone down during that round for the average payoff to go from non-negative to negative. We showed that the opponent will proceed through each of the n actions in order when it switches during phase 1, so as long as we can reliably force the opponent to switch actions, we correctly record a best response to each of the first n − 1 actions in phase 1.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Guide to Exploiting Unknown Strategies From a Known Bias Set</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/a-guide-to-exploiting-unknown-strategies-from-a-known-bias-set?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.5.2 Exploiting an Unknown Strategy from a Known Set of StrategiesAnother natural extension is to consider the scenario where we know the opponent uses some strategy from a known set of biased strategies B, but we don’t know which one. Again, we assume strategies in B are deterministic when parameterized with one of t possible deterministic tie-breaking mechanisms.\
Predicting the Opponent’s Actions\
The challenge, again, is to learn best responses. Generally, any time we can use the same algorithm to learn best responses given any strategy in B, this extension is trivial. For example if all strategies in B have the natural property discussed above (in 5.1) that after we play an action “enough” times, the opponent will eventually play a best response to it, we can use the same algorithm from 5.1 to learn best responses (using the maximum value required by any strategy as “enough”).\
If all strategies in B have property that the opponent plays a best response to an action if it is played “enough” times in a row, and we know the maximum upper bound on “enough”, we can learn best responses as described in 5.1.\
If it is not possible to use the same algorithm to learn best responses given any strategy in B, it might instead be possible to first distinguish between strategies which need different best-response algorithms, and then learn best responses. As a very simple example, if we know the opponent uses one of the Tie-Stay variant or the Tie-Shift variant of the WinStay, Lose-Shift strategy, we cannot use the strategy mentioned above because the Tie-Stay variant does not have the property in question. However, we can distinguish between the two strategies by checking whether the opponent “stays” after we play the same action as it (since a permissible game is symmetric, this must be a tie. We can check this within n rounds by playing the same action a until either the opponent switches to playing a, or stays on some other action b. If the opponent stays on b, we can then play b to check their tie behavior). Then, knowing our opponent’s strategy, we can use the corresponding algorithm from Section 4.3 to learn best responses (and in this case, to predict efficiently as well).\
Note, however, that it is not always possible to distinguish between deterministic strategies. As a simple example, consider playing a 3-action game against either the Myopic Best Responder, who plays a best response to our last action, or another opponent, call them Myopic Worst Responder, who plays a worst response to our last action. No matter how we play, the Myopic Best Responder with respect to rock-paper-scissors behaves identically to the Myopic Worst Responder with respect to a reverse version of rock-paper-scissors where the wins and losses are switched. Since both games are possible, we cannot distinguish whether the opponent is playing Myopic Best Response or Myopic Worst Response. Moreover, best responses with respect to one scenario are worst responses with respect to the other. Either of these opponents, if known, would be easy to exploit. However, in this case we cannot guarantee an average payoff greater than zero: if we play a best responses with respect to either opponent in a given round, it is a loss with respect to the other so our expected payoff for that round is 0.\
There exist collections of pairs of game matrices and strategies such that it is not possible to guarantee a positive average payoff, even if we could exploit any of the individual strategies if known to win nearly every round.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Video Friday: Hottest on the Ice</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/video-friday-hottest-on-the-ice</link><author>Evan Ackerman</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Your weekly selection of awesome robot videos]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Techniques to Beat the Tie-Stay Variant of Win-Stay, Lose-Shift</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/techniques-to-beat-the-tie-stay-variant-of-win-stay-lose-shift?source=rss</link><author>Algorithmic Bias</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[(1) Avrim Blum, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA;(2) Melissa Dutz, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, IL, USA.A.1 Win-Stay Lose-Shift Variant: Tie-Stay\
. Recall that the Tie-Stay variant of the Win-Stay Lose-Shift opponent plays the same action immediately following a win or a tie, and switches to the next action in its action ordering immediately following a loss. Because each action is beaten by at least one other action, the opponent must switch after one of the actions we play in response to its current action in phase 1 (since we play each action in succession). If the opponent shifts to play a new action in round r, we won round r − 1, so the best response we record is correct. Since the opponent always shifts to the next action in its action ordering, over n shifts, they will shift through every action before finally shifting back to the first action in its action ordering. Through this process we therefore record a best response to every action, and we record the correct action ordering in step 1. We play at most n actions in response to each action the opponent plays to make it shift, and one of them must beat the opponent’s action, so we incur no more than n(n − 1) losses or ties in this phase.\
At the end of the above, the opponent will have shifted back to the first action of their action ordering. However, we don’t generally know in advance when this shift will occur, so the action we played (some a) may or may not have been a best response to it and we therefore can’t be sure whether the opponent will stay or shift. By playing a repeatedly, the opponent will eventually play some action twice; this will happen within n rounds since each action is beaten by at least one other action and ties with itself. However, while the opponent is shifting we must be winning, so we only incur 2 losses or ties here, when the opponent finally plays some action b twice in a row.\
Since we finished round 2 with the opponent tying or winning, they will repeat their action (b) again in the next round; we win that round by playing the recorded best response to b (which we showed was correct) in phase 3.\
At the start of phase 4, we predict correctly because we won the previous round and know the opponent will shift to the next action in its order (which we showed we recorded correctly). We showed earlier that we recorded correct best responses, so we win by playing the recorded best response to the predicted action. The same conditions hold for every remaining round, so we win all remaining rounds.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>In the shadow of trauma - Life after Auschwitz | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CxhsN3W7fk</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Eva Umlauf is one of the youngest survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp. She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family’s fate played no role in her life.

But when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. 

Eva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. 

Her mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva’s young life.

During her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.

But a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. 

Later in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.

Our first “WebAssembly compiler in a tweet” was 269 bytes; since then, we’ve managed to whittle it down to a measly 192 bytes.The final result is a compiler that takes an arithmetic expression — written in reverse polish notation — and compiles it down to a valid WebAssembly module. That module exports a single function which returns the result of the original arithmetic expression. Here it is:And here’s an example of how you can use it:But this is not just a clever trick — if you take the time to understand what this code does, you’ll learn a surprising amount about WebAssembly! In the rest of the post, we’ll explain how it all works by de-obfuscating the code one step at a time.The first thing we can do to make it more readable is to format it:While it’s still pretty unreadable, now we can at least identify different parts of the code.At a high level, what we’re doing is ‘parsing’ the expression in a very simple way, turning it into the appropriate Wasm bytecode,
and then hand-crafting the bytes for a single-function module.In a more complex compiler you would probably use a library to generate the WebAssembly module and compile the expressions but our main metric
here is code size so we write the bytes directly in an array.In JavaScript the assignment operator is an expression. This means that it generates a result after evaluating, as you can see in the following examples:The code above will output:This is because  assigns  to  and the whole assignment expression evaluates to the value being assigned.In , we assign the result of evaluating  to . This equivalent expression may be easier to understand: .In our code, we use this trick to reuse variables and update their value in places where
we can also use the value being assigned. It also allows us to have our compiler in a single expression, avoiding the need for curly braces, semicolons and return statements.To undo it, we turn the body of our function into a block and do each assignment on its own line:Now the assignments are easier to identify but the meaning of variables and function
arguments are still hard to understand. Let’s fix that by undoing a couple of variable tricks.The first step is to stop using single letter variables, and to use more descriptive names instead. The next step is to stop reusing variables: for example,  initially holds the code to compile, but once we don’t need that any more we reuse it to hold the bytecode instructions.To undo this we are going to introduce a new  variable and rename  to . We’ll also rename  to . This variable contains a value that is close to the number of bytecodes.By declaring  in the body we can remove it from the function argument’s list. We did this
as a trick to avoid the need to declare it with  or , saving some bytes and the need for a function body.The trick works by adding unused arguments at the end of the function argument list and using them as local variables. Our compiler function expects a single argument with the code;  is there for us to use since we don’t expect the caller to provide any value for it.Here’s the code without this trick:If you look at the array in our code, you may notice that there are many commas followed by another comma instead of a value. This syntax defines “sparse arrays”. Here’s an example:We use this syntactic trick to save one byte each time we need a  to appear in the array. This works because Typed Arrays coerce all array items to numbers, and an “empty item” will be converted to 0:Let’s undo this trick by adding all the zeroes back:In our code, we have a variable  that contains a number that is close to the number
of bytecodes in the compiled expression, but not exactly the same:In the WebAssembly module we need to use the number of bytes in the function body (the expression to evaluate) in two places:To define the code section’s lengthTo define the function body’s lengthSince there’s only one function in the code section both values are similar:The section takes two extra bytes (section identifier and number of code entries)The function body takes another two bytes (number of locals and  instruction)To avoid writing  twice we assign to  the value of  in the place where we need the code section byte count
and then calculate  () where we need the function body byte count.This is all a trick to avoid having to write  twice.let’s assign the length to  and calculate the right value in each place:Let’s see how it works by creating a simple tagged template that turns the string to uppercase:As you can see, the first argument to the tagged template function is an array. Luckily for us, the first argument of String.prototype.split is handled in the following way:All values that are not undefined or objects with a  method are coerced to strings.And coercing an array with one string in it is the same as the string itself:Since the function we want to call takes a single string argument, we can use it as a tagged template and save the parentheses in the function call.Let’s write it as a function call instead:The ternary operator has expressions on each branch saving us the  statements. Here’s what the code looks like when we use an  statement instead:The next trick to undo is the one present twice in the following code:First we use coercion in  to check if the token  is a string representing a
positive number. Then we use coercion again in  to let JavaScript turn  into a  in the :The code above evaluates to:Let’s write the parsing and checking explicitly:The semantics of our compiler change a little bit here. The original version will only accept
positive integers as input; if you want a negative number you have to subtract from zero:  to get . The new version allows negative numbers since it checks with  instead of .The next trick is in the  branch:Our calculator compiler only accepts four arithmetic operations: , , , and . But
in the code above you can only see three:  and a magical number: . Here’s how it works — these are the bytecode numbers for arithmetic operations in WebAssembly:We only enter this branch if the token  is not a number, which means it can only be
one of the arithmetic operators above. So, given a single character which is one of those four operators, we want to produce the appropriate opcode.We  have written . That is, we find the symbol’s index in the string:…and add  to it to get the bytecode number. But when  is not in the string,  returns . We can use that to our advantage, and treat  to mean “plus or any other token”::  (any other token will be  too)And that’s why we add  instead of . Let’s undo the  trick:Here again the semantics change a little bit. Before, if the token  wasn’t found, the expression would evaluate to  which would map to an addition. Now it will evaluate to  which will map to bytecode  which is the  instruction.But don’t worry, we’ll fix it in the next step.After explaining how the  trick works and removing the  part, let’s
go ahead and remove the trick completely. To do it we are going to create an object that maps from an arithmetic operation token to its bytecode:To keep the initial semantics, if the token is not a valid operation we return the bytecode for : in .From the usage example at the beginning of the post, you may have noticed that the exported
function’s name is the empty string:We did this to save us the bytes needed to specify the export name,
but also to save an extra byte/character in the code because with the length of the export name being 
we can use the sparse array syntax to leave an empty spot in the WebAssembly module array.To revert this trick we are going to name the exported function as , which in UTF-8 is the byte :We can now call it with a nicer name:Our initial implementation only supported positive numbers, but that’s not the only number restriction in our compiler.To keep WebAssembly modules as small as possible, numbers are encoded using a variable-length encoding algorithm called LEB128. You can tell we are not implementing the whole algorithm by looking at the part of the code that encodes numbers: . We’re assuming the number being encoded fits in 7 bits, the shortest possible LEB128 representation.Let’s try the limits of our implementation:This means the only numbers that will be parsed correctly are from  to .Uncaught CompileError: WebAssembly.instantiate(): Compiling function #0 failed: function body must end with “end” opcode @+33In the last one we went over the 7 bits and the module was rejected during validation.Explaining and implementing LEB128 takes a lot of text and code. If you want to read more
about it we have a whole deep dive on LEB128 in our book.During the code golfing phase I had a literal shower thought but sadly it didn’t work.The idea was to simplify  by using the UTF-8 character code plus an offset like this:  and saving 3 bytes in the process. The reason it didn’t work is that the characters  don’t appear in the same order in UTF-8 and WebAssembly bytecode.The last part to expand/explain is the array of numbers used to build the WebAssembly module.It takes a big part of a specification to explain every byte in the array, but here’s a commented version that should give you a high level idea of what each part does:There you go! We’ve turned a rather opaque 192-byte snippet into something that’s almost readable. And in the process, you hopefully learned a little bit about WebAssembly.If we dropped the size restrictions, there are lots of things we might want to improve in this compiler: handle numbers greater than 127, add nicer syntax, add support for conditionals, loops, etc. If you’re interested in what that might look like, I encourage you to check out our book WebAssembly from the Ground Up. You’ll learn the ins and outs of WebAssembly by writing a real compiler for a simple programming language. It’s a lot of fun!Special thanks to lexi for contributing some of the tricks used above.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sony To End Blu-ray Media Production After 18 Years</title><link>https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/01/24/1649223/sony-to-end-blu-ray-media-production-after-18-years?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 16:49:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sony will cease production of recordable Blu-ray discs at its last factory in February, ending an 18-year manufacturing run amid declining demand for physical media.

Welcome to the pages of Snowdrop OS, my homebrew operating system project.
Snowdrop OS was born of my childhood curiosity around what happens when a PC is turned on, the mysteries of bootable disks, and the hidden aspects of operating systems. It is a 16-bit real mode operating system for the IBM PC architecture. I designed and developed this homebrew OS from scratch, using only x86 assembly language. 
I have created and included a number of utilities, including a file manager, text editor, graphical applications, BASIC interpreter, x86 assembler and debugger. I also ported one of my DOS games to it. After all, what kind of an operating system doesn't have games?
The Snowdrop OS and the apps are distributed as both a floppy disk (1.44Mb) image, as well as a CD-ROM image. The images contain the following, all programmed from scratch:
a boot loader which loads the kernel into memorya kernel which sets up interrupt vectors to be used by user apps, and then loads the startup appuser apps, including a shell (command line interface), utilities, test apps, and aSMtris, my Tetris clone
Snowdrop OS can also be installed to a hard disk - prompting the user to do so during boot - if it detects one. 
I hope that Snowdrop can serve other programmers who are looking to get a basic understanding of operating system functions. Like my other projects, the source code is fully available, without any restrictions on its usage and modification.

Some interesting areas in the source code are: v1 - initial version, single tasking, shell, aSMtris
v2 - PS/2 mouse driver and mouse test apps
v3 - basic multi-tasking support and virtual display support
v4 - FAT12 driver write/delete, file manager, text editor
v5 - serial port driver, formatting utilities, file copy support
v6 - multiplayer snake game (over serial port)
v7 - slide show presentation app
v8 - "keep memory" task lifetime mode, for custom services
v9 - parallel port driver, BMP image support, sprites
v10 - system timer frequency change
v11 - animated sprites, sound driver (internal speaker)
v12 - keyboard driver
v13 - more sprites functionality, Storks game
v14 - kernel config, program arguments, file utilities
v15 - 16x2 LCD controller app, text editor fixes
v16 - GUI framework
v17 - Snowmine (Minesweeper-like game)
v18 - BASIC interpreter and linker
v19 - install to hard disk
v20 - BASIC and text editor improvements
v21 - integration of BASIC and GUI framework
v22 - x86 assembler, multi-disk support, file view utilities
v24 - service loading
v25 - dynamic memory and data structures
v26 - installer improvements, pseudo-mouse driver
v27 - kernel and inter-task messaging
v28 - GUI higher resolution, draw application, desktop application
v29 - data compression, Hangman game
v30 - pseudo-mouse driver improvements
v31 - runtime libraries (RTL), BASIC interpreter RTL

An AWS error glared back at me. I didn’t want to figure it out without AI’s help.After 12 years of coding, I’d somehow become worse at my own craft. And this isn’t hyperbole—this is the new reality for software developers.First, I stopped reading documentation. Why bother when AI could explain things instantly?Then, my debugging skills took the hit. Stack traces now feel unapproachable without AI. I don’t even read error messages anymore, I just copy and paste them.I’ve become a human clipboard, a mere intermediary between my code and an LLM.Previously, every error message used to teach me something. Now? The solution appears magically, and I learn nothing. The dopamine hit of instant answers has replaced the satisfaction of genuine understanding.Deep comprehension is the next thing that was affected. Remember spending hours understanding why a solution works? Now, I simply implement AI suggestions. If they don’t work, I improve the context, and just ask the AI again. It’s a cycle of increasing dependency.Then come the emotional changes. Previously, it was a part of the  of programming to solve new problems. Now, I get frustrated if AI doesn’t give me a solution in 5 minutes.The scariest part? I’m building an AI-powered development tool, but I can’t shake the feeling I’m contributing to the very problem that’s eroding our collective skills.I’m not suggesting anything radical like going AI-free completely—that’s unrealistic. Instead, I’m starting with “No-AI Days.” One day a week where:Read every error message completelyUse actual debuggers againRead source code instead of asking AII won’t lie, it sucks. I feel slower, dumber, and more frustrated.But I can also see the difference. I feel a stronger connection with my code and a sense of ownership, which had slowly disappeared with AI. Plus, I learn a lot more.We’re not becoming 10x developers with AI.We’re becoming 10x  on AI. Every time we let AI solve a problem we could’ve solved ourselves, we’re trading long-term understanding for short-term productivity. We’re optimizing for today’s commit at the cost of tomorrow’s ability.I’m not suggesting we abandon AI tools—that ship has sailed. But we need rules of engagement. Here’s some ideas that I have:No AI for problems that you haven’t tried to understand firstRead and understand all AI-suggested solutionsRegular periods of coding without AI assistanceFocus on learning patterns, not just fixing immediate issuesI won’t lie, I don’t think I’ll be able to follow these rules all the time. But it’s a start, and I strongly believe anyone who’s new to programming should  follow all of these rules.Right now, somewhere, a new programmer is learning to code. They’ll never know the satisfaction of solving problems truly on their own. They’ll never experience the deep understanding that comes from wrestling with a bug for hours.We’re creating a generation of developers who can ask AI the right questions but can’t understand the answers. Every time AI goes down, they’re exposed as increasingly helpless. As of now, AI isn’t capable enough to replace programmers fully, but this will only get worse as it improves. The real question isn’t whether AI will replace programmers. It’s whether we’re replacing ourselves.Try coding without AI for just one day.

The algorithm addresses something called the library sorting problem (more formally, the “list labeling” problem). The challenge is to devise a strategy for organizing books in some kind of sorted order — alphabetically, for instance — that minimizes how long it takes to place a new book on the shelf.Imagine, for example, that you keep your books clumped together, leaving empty space on the far right of the shelf. Then, if you add a book by Isabel Allende to your collection, you might have to move every book on the shelf to make room for it. That would be a time-consuming operation. And if you then get a book by Douglas Adams, you’ll have to do it all over again. A better arrangement would leave unoccupied spaces distributed throughout the shelf — but how, exactly, should they be distributed?This problem was introduced in a 1981 paper, and it goes beyond simply providing librarians with organizational guidance. That’s because the problem also applies to the arrangement of files on hard drives and in databases, where the items to be arranged could number in the billions. An inefficient system means significant wait times and major computational expense. Researchers have invented some efficient methods for storing items, but they’ve long wanted to determine the best possible way.Last year, in a study that was presented at the Foundations of Computer Science conference in Chicago, a team of seven researchers described a way to organize items that comes tantalizingly close to the theoretical ideal. The new approach combines a little knowledge of the bookshelf’s past contents with the surprising power of randomness.“It’s a very important problem,” said Seth Pettie, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, because many of the data structures we rely upon today store information sequentially. He called the new work “extremely inspired [and] easily one of my top three favorite papers of the year.”So how does one measure a well-sorted bookshelf? A common way is to see how long it takes to insert an individual item. Naturally, that depends on how many items there are in the first place, a value typically denoted by . In the Isabel Allende example, when all the books have to move to accommodate a new one, the time it takes is proportional to . The bigger the , the longer it takes. That makes this an “upper bound” to the problem: It will never take longer than a time proportional to  to add one book to the shelf.The authors of the 1981 paper that ushered in this problem wanted to know if it was possible to design an algorithm with an average insertion time much less than. And indeed, they proved that one could do better. They created an algorithm that was guaranteed to achieve an average insertion time proportional to (log ). This algorithm had two properties: It was “deterministic,” meaning that its decisions did not depend on any randomness, and it was also “smooth,” meaning that the books must be spread evenly within subsections of the shelf where insertions (or deletions) are made. The authors left open the question of whether the upper bound could be improved even further. For over four decades, no one managed to do so.However, the intervening years did see improvements to the lower bound. While the upper bound specifies the maximum possible time needed to insert a book, the lower bound gives the fastest possible insertion time. To find a definitive solution to a problem, researchers strive to narrow the gap between the upper and lower bounds, ideally until they coincide. When that happens, the algorithm is deemed optimal — inexorably bounded from above and below, leaving no room for further refinement.In 2004, a team of researchers found that the best any algorithm could do for the library sorting problem — in other words, the ultimate lower bound — was log . This result pertained to the most general version of the problem, applying to any algorithm of any type. Two of the same authors had already secured a result for a more specific version of the problem in 1990, showing that for any smooth algorithm, the lower bound is significantly higher: (log ). And in 2012, another team proved the same lower bound, (log ), for any deterministic algorithm that does not use randomness at all.These results showed that for any smooth or deterministic algorithm, you could not achieve an average insertion time better than (log ), which was the same as the upper bound established in the 1981 paper. In other words, to improve that upper bound, researchers would need to devise a different kind of algorithm. “If you’re going to do better, you have to be randomized and non-smooth,” said Michael Bender, a computer scientist at Stony Brook University.But getting rid of smoothness, which requires items to be spread apart more or less evenly, seemed like a mistake. (Remember the problems that arose from our initial example — the non-smooth configuration where all the books were clumped together on the left-hand side of the shelf.) And it also was not obvious how leaving things to random chance — essentially a coin toss — would help matters. “Intuitively, it wasn’t clear that was a direction that made sense,” Bender said.Nevertheless, in 2022, Bender and five colleagues decided to try out a randomized, non-smooth algorithm anyway, just to see whether it might offer any advantages.Ironically, progress came from another restriction. There are sound privacy or security reasons why you may want to use an algorithm that’s blind to the history of the bookshelf. “If I had on my bookshelf and took it off,” said William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, nobody would be able to tell.In a 2022 paper, Bender, Kuszmaul and four co-authors created just such an algorithm — one that was “history independent,” non-smooth and randomized — which finally reduced the 1981 upper bound, bringing the average insertion time down to (log ).Kuszmaul remembers being surprised that a tool normally used to ensure privacy could confer other benefits. “It’s as if you used cryptography to make your algorithm faster,” he said. “Which just seems kind of strange.”Helen Xu of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not part of this research team, was also impressed.  She said that the idea of using history independence for reasons other than security may have implications for many other types of problems.Bender, Kuszmaul and others made an even bigger improvement with last year’s paper. They again broke the record, lowering the upper bound to (log ) times (log log ) — equivalent to (log ). In other words, they came exceedingly close to the theoretical limit, the ultimate lower bound of log .Once again, their approach was non-smooth and randomized, but this time their algorithm relied on a limited degree of history dependence. It looked at past trends to plan for future events, but only up to a point. Suppose, for instance, you’ve been getting a lot of books by authors whose last name starts with N — Nabokov, Neruda, Ng. The algorithm extrapolates from that and assumes more are probably coming, so it’ll leave a little extra space in the N section. But reserving too much space could lead to trouble if a bunch of A-name authors start pouring in. “The way we made it a good thing was by being strategically random about how much history to look at when we make our decisions,” Bender said.The result built on and transformed their previous work. It “uses randomness in a completely different way than the 2022 paper,” Pettie said.These papers collectively represent “a significant improvement” on the theory side, said Brian Wheatman, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago. “And on the applied side, I think they have the potential for a big improvement as well.”Xu agrees. “In the past few years, there’s been interest in using data structures based on list labeling for storing and processing dynamic graphs,” she said. These advances would almost certainly make things faster.Meanwhile, there’s more for theorists to contemplate. “We know that we can almost do log ,” Bender said, “[but] there’s still this tiny gap” — the diminutive log log term that stands in the way of a complete solution. “We don’t know if the right thing to do is to lower the upper bound or raise the lower bound.”Pettie, for one, doesn’t expect the lower bound to change. “Usually in these situations, when you see a gap this close, and one of the bounds looks quite natural and the other looks unnatural, then the natural one is the right answer,” he said. It’s much more likely that any future improvements will affect the upper bound, bringing it all the way down to log  “But the world’s full of weird surprises.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Cs16.css – CSS library based on Counter Strike 1.6 UI</title><link>https://cs16.samke.me/</link><author>samke-</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 15:37:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

My newest favorite feature is the  operator, which was the "last holdout" for common Vim operators:But we’ve also been making progress on fleshing out the command palette with things like  and  to execute a command on matching (or non-matching) lines.The broader community has also been working on pulling in top Vim plugins. We have versions of vim-surround, sneak, and as of recently, tree-sitter text objects:All in all, if you use Vim today, the chances are that most of what you want to do on a daily basis in the editor will work in Zed exactly as it does in Vim.There are three areas of focus I’d like to push on in 2025 for Vim in Zed:Building out the non-editor user experienceRaising the bar on matching Vim edge-case-for-edge-case.Creating a new, better, multi-cursor Vim integrationAlthough Vim seems to have “no UI” this is a sleight of hand. After  you’re in ex mode, which is full of features that make it work well. In particular, I want to bring to Zed:Filename completion in the command palette , or  for exampleCommand history, so you can fix a  without typing it out again to run a sequence of keystrokes (and a few other missing commands)There are also other Vim UI’s to bring into Zed: to see your registers.Interestingly both registers and marks are more powerful in Vim than Zed today because they persist state to disk across a restart. We need to build that too.Finally Zed has significant surface area that Vim does not have, and I'd like them to feel Vim-native:Keyboard shortcuts for collaboration features like ‘follow next person’, and a keyboard driven way to join and leave calls, mute/share etc.Better shortcuts for the AI edit predictor, and handling in normal mode. Similarly for the inline assistant, which also tends to bug out in Vim mode today.Bringing more netrw like bindings to the project panelTighter integration with the upcoming Git panelPeople who switch to Zed from Vim are attracted by the “just works by default”
aspect of Zed: language servers just work, and the advanced features (AI,
collaboration). But, nothing is more frustrating than a Vim mode that doesn’t
work   like Vim. We get a lot of VS Code Vim extension refugees, and the number
one complaint is that “it just didn’t feel right”.Zed is already much closer to Vim. We have extensive "side-by-side" testing
where we run headless Neovim to ensure our keyboard shortcuts do exactly the
same thing. That said, there's always more to do, both to add the remaining
minor motions / come to mind, and fix edge cases in things like .Zed has multi-cursor, and Zed’s Vim mode works “as you’d expect” with multiple
cursors for the most part. The problem I'd like to solve is two-fold:Tidying up the bindings so there's a coherent feature set around Vim with multi-cursor.In particular making sure you can easily rotate into multi-cursor as though it were another mode.Adding to Zed support for moving just one of your selections in case you make a mistake selecting.There are a few editors that have prior art here, particularly Kakoune and
Helix; but also Vim plugins that I want to get inspiration from.If you'd like to help work on any of this, you can book time to pair with
me. Also feel free to peruse the list in
the Vim channel notes and pick up
things that sound interesting to you. While I am happy to accept PRs out of the
blue, I always prefer talking things through first.If there's something I'm missing, or not prioritizing, please add it to the

At the time, my setup was modest: I used the  (when it first launched) to tie together all my apartment’s lights. As I got more comfortable with automations, I also began building custom hardware like temperature and humidity sensors.However, once I started adding more complexity (more devices, more automations), I realized that running Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi just wasn’t viable anymore. This was before Home Assistant offered their own hardware (which I haven’t tried, so I can’t say much about it). But for me, the main issue was the database. By default, Home Assistant uses SQLite, and when you have a ton of sensor data flowing in, SQLite can start choking.My solution was to move everything to a VM on my home server. I also migrated Home Assistant’s main database to MySQL, and for longer-term metrics and historical data, I set up an InfluxDB server. (I’ve documented the details of my home server build in another blog post.)Scaling Up in a New HouseWhen I moved into a house, my Home Assistant installation grew significantly: more rooms, more lights, and more devices overall. Right now, I have over 100 devices connected to Home Assistant, including a large number of smart lights (all IKEA), plus an assortment of other smart devices. Practically every bulb in my home is now integrated into Home Assistant.Adaptive Lighting: Moving Beyond FluxOne of the crucial features for me is . Initially, I used Flux (an older solution for synchronizing lights with the time of day), but I’ve recently migrated to the new Adaptive Lighting integration available through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store). This newer system is much more sophisticated and has better capabilities for adjusting color temperature and brightness throughout the day.Managing this setup comes with two main challenges. First, neither Flux nor Adaptive Lighting can target light groups. Instead, you need to explicitly list every single light entity in your configuration. This becomes particularly tedious when you have dozens of lights that you want to manage together. It would have been much more convenient to just point the integration to a group and have it handle all the lights within that group automatically.The second challenge is that even though all my bulbs are from IKEA, they don’t have all the same features. This means I need separate configurations for each category to get Adaptive Lighting working correctly. But the effort is worth it: circadian rhythms are important to me, and I really want that smooth, automatic shift in color temperature from warm yellows in the morning and evenings to cooler whites and blues during midday.Using Cursor to Speed Up ConfigurationOne big leap for me this year has been leveraging Cursor, an AI coding assistant, to handle the more tedious parts of Home Assistant’s YAML configurations. I’ll admit, I’ve never had the time to master every detail of Home Assistant’s DSL or its configuration files.The first major task I tackled with Cursor was writing a custom script to parse all my lights, figure out exactly what kind of bulb each one is, and spit out debugging information. This is the foundation of building the correct adaptive lighting setup. Once the script categorizes the bulbs, I can then create or update the YAML configuration for each bulb type.Here’s the script I use to analyze my Home Assistant lights. It connects to the Home Assistant API, categorizes all lights by their capabilities, and provides detailed debugging information about their current state and supported features:Run the custom parsing script on my Home Assistant setup to produce a detailed list of bulbs and their capabilities. into Cursor (in “agent mode” or similar), along with my old configuration. the updated YAML for the new Adaptive Lighting system.It’s been a huge time-saver. Sure, I still do some manual debugging, but I also use Cursor to assist with the troubleshooting. For instance, if something breaks in Home Assistant, I feed the logs into Cursor and ask it to help me fix the error. It’s surprisingly effective.After extensive testing, I’ve optimized my adaptive lighting configurations for different IKEA bulb types. Here are my recommended settings that provide smooth transitions while maintaining good visibility throughout the day.For IKEA’s LED bulb GU10 345 lumen, smart/wireless dimmable white spectrum bulbs.Dimmable color and white spectrumFor the LED bulb E27 806 lumen, wireless dimmable color and white spectrum/globe opal white bulbs.For the basic LED bulb GU10 345 lumen, smart/wireless dimmable warm white bulbs.Now that the lighting is running smoothly, my next big smart home project is upgrading all my radiators with Zigbee-based smart TRVs (thermostatic radiator valves). The goal is to have each room in my home maintain an optimal temperature by reading from the central Nest thermostat. In older British homes like mine, temperature control isn’t very granular, so having each radiator adjust itself is a major comfort and efficiency boost.I’ve already purchased these TRVs but haven’t had time to configure them yet. My plan is: to my Zigbee network. from my Nest thermostat (the main sensor). in Home Assistant so that each room’s radiator valve opens or closes based on its own target temperature.I’m hoping this will help solve the typical British house problem: some rooms end up too warm, while others are never warm enough. With per-room heating control, it should be far more balanced and efficient.That’s where my Home Assistant journey sits at the moment. I’m thrilled with how the adaptive lighting is working, especially now that I’ve harnessed an AI coding assistant to manage the complexity of my YAML files. The next challenge, smart radiator valves, will hopefully bring my home’s temperature control on par with my lighting automation.Found an error or typo?

This time I will ask you that we
start and support a vibe shift when it comes to dependencies.You're probably familiar with the concept of “dependency churn.”  It's that
never-ending treadmill of updates, patches, audits, and transitive
dependencies that we as developers love to casually install in the name of
productivity.  Who doesn't enjoy waiting for yet another 
just so you can get that fix for a bug you don't even have?It's a plague in most ecosystems with good packaging solutions.
JavaScript and Rust are particularly badly affected by that.  A brand new
Tokio project drags in 28 crates, a new Rocket project balloons that to
172, and a little template engine like MiniJinja can exist with just a
single dependency — while its CLI variant slurps up 142.If that doesn't sound like a big deal, let's consider terminal_size.  It is a crate that does
exactly what its name suggests: it figures out your terminal dimensions.
The underlying APIs it uses have effectively been stable since the earliest days of computing
terminals—what, 50 years or so? And yet, for one function, terminal-size
manages to introduce three or four additional crates, depending on your
operating system.  That triggers a whole chain reaction, so you end up
compiling thousands of other functions just to figure out if your terminal
is 80x25 or 120x40.  That crate had 26 releases.  My own version of that
that I have stuck away in a project from 10 years ago still works without
a single update.  Because shocker: nothing about figuring out terminal
sizes has changed.  So why does  have so many updates if it's so stable?
Because it's build on top of platform abstraction libraries that
constantly churn, so it needs to update to avoid code duplication and
blowing up compile times even more.But “big supply chain” will tell you that you must do it this way.  Don't
you dare to copy paste that function into your library.  Or don't you date
to use “unsafe” yourself.  You're not qualified enough to write unsafe
code, let the platform abstraction architects do that.  Otherwise someone
will slap you.  There are
entire companies who are making a living of supplying you with the tools
needed to deal with your dependency mess.  In the name of security, we're
pushed to having dependencies and keeping them up to date, despite most of
those dependencies being the primary source of security problems.The goal of code in many ways should be to be written in a way that it
does not need updates.  It should eventually achieve some level of
stability.  In the Rust ecosystem stable code is punished.  If you have a
perfectly working dependency but you have a somewhat inactive bug tracker,
RUSTSEC will come by and give you a chunk rating.But there  a simpler path.  You write code yourself.  Sure, it's more
work up front, but once it's written, it's done. No new crates, no waiting
for upsteam authors to fix that edge case.  If it's broken for you, you
fix it yourself.  Code that works doesn't necessarily need the
maintenance treadmill.  Your code has a corner case?  Who cares.  This is
that vibe shift we need in the Rust world: celebrating fewer dependencies
rather than more.We're at a point in the most ecosystems where pulling in libraries is not
just the default action, it's seen positively: “Look how modular and
composable my code is!”  Actually, it might just be a symptom of never
wanting to type out more than a few lines.Now one will make the argument that it takes so much time to write all of
this.  It's 2025 and it's faster for me to have ChatGPT or Cursor whip up
a dependency free implementation of these common functions, than it is for
me to start figuring out a dependency.  And it makes sense as for many
such small functions the maintenance overhead is tiny and much lower than
actually dealing with constant upgrading of dependencies.  The code is just
a few lines and you also get the benefit of no longer need to compile
thousands of lines of other people's code for a single function.But let's face it: corporate code review culture has also has infected
Open Source software.  Companies are more likely to reward engineers than
scold them for pulling in that new “shiny library” that solves the problem
they never actually had.  That creates problems, so dependabot and friends
were born.  Today I just dread getting dependabot pull requests but on
projects but I have to accept it.  I'm part of an ecosystem with my stuff
and that ecosystem is all about churn, churn, churn.  In companies you can
also keep entire internal engineering teams busy with vendoring
dependencies, internal audits and upgrading things throughout the company.Fighting this fight is incredibly hard!  Every new hire has been trained
on the idea that dependencies are great, that code reuse is great.  That
having old code sitting around is a sign of bad engineering culture.It's also hard to fight this in Open Source.  Years ago I wrote sha1-smol which originally was just called
.  It became the standard crate to calculate SHA1 hashes.
Eventually I was pressured to donate that package name to rust-crypto and
to depend on the rest of the crypto ecosystem as it was so established.
If you want to use the new sha1 crate, you get to enjoy 10 dependencies.
But there was just no way around it, because that name in the registry is
precious and people also wanted to have trait compatibility.  It feels
tiring to be the only person in a conversation pushing to keep the churn
down and dependencies low.It's time to have a new perspective: we should give kudos to engineers who
write a small function themselves instead of hooking in a transitive web
of crates.  We should be suspicious of big crate graphs.  Celebrated are
the minimal dependencies, the humble function that just quietly does the
job, the code that doesn't need to be touched for years because it was
done right once.And sure, it's not black and white.  There are the important libraries
that solve hard problems.  Graphics libraries that abstract over complex
drivers, implementations of protocols like HTTP and QUIC.  I won't be able
to get rid of tokio and I have no desire to.  But when you end up using
one function, but you compile hundreds, some alarm bell should go off.We need that vibe shift.  To celebrate building it yourself when it's
appropriate to do so.  To give credit to library authors who build low to
no-dependency Open Source libraries.For instance minijinja celebrates it in the readme:$ cargo tree
minimal v0.1.0 (examples/minimal)
└── minijinja v2.6.0 (minijinja)
    └── serde v1.0.144
And it has a PR to eventually get rid of the last dependency.  And sometime this
year I will make it my goal to go ahead proudly and trim down all that fat
in my projects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia says it will not allow NATO dominance in Baltic Sea</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/russia-says-not-allow-nato-132913887.html</link><author>/u/jbound00001</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:41:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A senior Russian official has said that Moscow will counter any moves by Western military alliance NATO to dominate the Baltic Sea.Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told the Russian television channel Rossiya-24 on Friday that the Western alliance's decision to increase patrols around the Baltic was further proof of NATO's "desire to turn the Baltic Sea into a NATO lake.""This will not happen for many reasons, and one of the main reasons is, of course, that the Russian Federation will not allow it."Russia's position on the Baltic Sea has been weakened by the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO.

It also sends a notification about the release to a Slack webhook for our team.Secrets for these services were stored in our CI’s built-in Vault (we are running a self-hosted Woodpecker CI).Recently, while moving plugins to separate repositories, I decided to try Infisical for centralized secrets management instead of the internal CI Vault. Infisical provides a self-hosted open-source solution, has a well-organized UI, and offers better access control than our CI Vault. It was important to me that I could reuse secrets across different repositories without copying them every time I created a new plugin.Pretty dumb method to export secrets to the  file, but it was late evening, and I didn’t want to spend much time on it at the start.I made the first push, and everything worked fine on the first attempt. I was happy.Then I started adding the same code to the first plugin, and the plugin build failed with a very unexpected error.It said that my NPM token was invalid. I was surprised and started printing the environment variables to see what was wrong (printing environment variables to the build log is a pretty bad practice and is the last thing you want to do, but I knew it was an internal CI, and the project was private).I saw that my NPM token was still in the environment variables and was the same.I went back to the first repository and retried the build. It failed with the same error.I went to NPM and found out that the token had disappeared entirely from the list. I was shocked and recreated it.On the next build, I discovered that the Slack webhook was also not working. However, GitHub releases were created without issues in both repositories.Then I noticed an email push notification from Slack titled "Notification about invalidated webhook URLs."This was the moment I realized that  had simply taken my  file and published it to NPM.Shortly after, I noticed a recent email from NPM titled "Granular access token deleted."The next thing I did was revoke all tokens, including the GitHub token, which still worked, and unpublish all packages from NPM (though they might still be cloned by some caches/aggregators/archivers).GitHub was not able to recognize that the token had been leaked to an NPM package and revoke it. Although they do a pretty good job when you push other vendors’ secrets to a GitHub repository, it seems they don’t check NPM sources.NPM detected that the NPM token was published to their registry and revoked it. However, it was hard to understand why—it was simply deleted. They sent an email, but it did not explain why the token was deleted or specify the source of the leak. Showing an error in the tokens list on the NPM website would have been the best option.I was surprised, but Slack did a great job. They monitor NPM (I don’t think they monitor the whole NPM registry; there’s probably some interesting technology behind it). They detected that the NPM token was published to the registry and invalidated it. They sent an email with a clear explanation of why it was invalidated and what steps to take next.We can talk a lot about bad programming practices, but the main takeaway is that we are human. And humans still make mistakes.It makes a lot of sense to monitor for such human errors.In my case, NPM and Slack saved me from a potential security breach. Without their intervention, I would have learned about the issue only when someone used my tokens for malicious purposes.GitHub didn’t detect or revoke the token, and many other services wouldn’t have done so either.Here are some common recommendations I learned from this experience:Try to limit token access as much as possible to only the required granularity. Even if something is leaked, it won’t cause much harm. Don’t grant access to all resources/packages/repos unless it’s necessary.Check what you publish, especially when making changes to your build pipeline. I missed the fact that the  file was being published.Appreciate services that monitor for leaks and respond to them. They can save you from potential security breaches.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What platforms should I be considering?</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1i8wi4q/what_platforms_should_i_be_considering/</link><author>/u/jaymef</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 14:23:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Kubernetes</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bit of context.

Instead, you need to review line-by-line and check: “what if the service crashes here?”, “what if the API we call here is temporarily unavailable”, “what if a concurrent invocation overtakes this one here”, or “what if this process becomes a zombie while executing this function, how do I prevent it from corrupting the state?”.As a result, you spend a huge amount of time worrying about failover strategies, retries, race conditions, locking/fencing, ordering of operations, order visibility of changes, decoupling availability, etc. They add queues, key-value stores, locking services, schedulers, workflow orchestrators and they try to get them all to play nice together. And the hard truth is, many applications don’t get it right and are not correct under failures or even under load.How can we radically simplify this? In this article, we walk through a core idea that addresses many of these issues, by avoiding distributed coordination. Much of this goes back to learnings from when we built Apache Flink.Let’s start with an observation about distributed applications and infrastructure:  are logs: Apache Kafka, Pulsar, Meta’s Scribe are distributed implementations of the log abstraction. Message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS) internally replicate messages through logs. (and K/V stores) are logs: changes go to the write-ahead-log first, then get materialized into the tables. The database community has the famous saying “The log is the database; everything else is cache (or materialized views)” - often attributed to Pat Helland. The idea of “Turning the Database Inside Out” starts with a log.Distributed locking- and leader election services (like ZooKeeper, Etcd, …) are consensus logs at their core. Consensus algorithms, like Raft, inherently model log replication.Persistent  materialize logs of their state transitions.When you build an application or microservice that interacts, for example, with a database, a message queue, and a service API (backed by another database), you are orchestrating a handful of different logs in your business logic.In this example, we want to implement a  handler. The payment has an ID that identifies it. The handler is triggered from a queue (which also re-delivers the event if the handler fails or times out) and the processing involves checking a fraud detection model, updating account balance, storing the status, and sending a notification. There are other handlers that may handle the same payment ID, for example to cancel the payment, block it, unblock it, revert it.You can probably spot some issues:Concurrent invocations (other handlers like “cancel”, or retries of the same event) can produce arbitrary results.A failure after line 15 means the next retry does nothing and we don’t send a notification.If the fraud model is not completely deterministic (or if it is updated between retries), we might assume a payment is valid, crash after line 9, the retry declares the payment not valid, and we are setting the status to BLOCKED despite the fact that we withdrew the money.Nasty stuff! Let’s try to improve that.This second version of the code does some things better, but still has issues. One of them is around line 20, where we need to ensure that we are still the owner of the lock at the point in time where the database persists the update. That is really hard to do, because distributed lock release or re-entrance is never 100% correct, due to the impossibility of precise failure detection (is a process failed or just slow or is our network partitioned?), so locking generally requires an additional fencing mechanism. Martin Kleppmann has a great blog post about the rabbit hole of getting distributed locking right.Why is it so hard to make this seemingly simple handler work reliably? Because our goal is to make consistent changes depending on the status of disparate systems, where each has its own view of the world, maintained in its separate log.Distributed applications often need to , carefully  that help them ensure correctness. This is the heart of much of the complexity in modern distributed applications.Now let’s assume that all these systems (queues, DBs, locks, …) operate off the same log - for the sake of this thought experiment - the log of the message queue that delivers the  to the  handler (the ).Every time our  handler wants to change some state of another system, it writes a record to the upstream log. That new record is linked to the original . Whenever the queue decides to re-deliver the  again (e.g., under a timeout or an assumed failure), it also attaches all linked log entries (the ).Now we can adjust lines 9,10,11 (the call to the fraud-detector API and storing the result) to write the result of the API call to the upstream log. When the handler is retried after a potential failure, it automatically sees whether the result was written before. This is not just efficient, but we no longer store completed steps in a shared DB where it is easy to have it accidentally picked up in unexpected ways (see this article for how this can be a severe security and integrity loophole).This becomes particularly useful, if we require a  to add an entry to the log: We can only append that entry, if no newer retry was triggered. That is easy for a queue to track (it knows whether it sent the  out again) and our  handler would quit if the conditional append failed, knowing that another retry attempt has taken over.Now, concurrently executing retries (if the queue incorrectly assumes a handler failed and re-sent the event) can no longer corrupt the step history. This implementation gives us pretty strong workflow-style execution guarantees for our code!To make locking (line 2) and state update (line 20) work reliably, the  handler writes the relevant events (, , ) to the upstream log as well. After writing the  event, the handler waits until the lock service grants the lock.The lock service and the database now follow the upstream log as if it was their own write-ahead log. The database can simply apply the update when it reads the event, the locking service of course only grants the lock when available (might have to wait to encounter the previous holder’s  event).Somewhat surprisingly, this pretty much eliminates all problems and corner cases we had with locks and state before: Lock acquisition and release through the upstream log and handler’s journal means we reliably keep the lock across retries. Having the update event conditionally appended to the same event journal as the lock event replaces the need for the lock’s fencing token - plus, we can be sure that we apply the update once and only once.So, once we implement our logic like this, EVERYTHING JUST WORKS.We can inject all sorts of failures, stalls, network partitions. As long as the log is correctly implemented, the program will always remain correct. And all that the  handler needs to do is (1) trigger actions as conditional-log-appends and (2) skip over actions whose log entries are already attached to the . This is super easy to implement in a library, because it doesn’t require any form of distributed coordination.We haven’t added a new distributed system primitive; in fact we’ve removed several. The benefits come from avoiding the need for coordination.Before we started using the same log, the state was spread across systems: The status of the operation, whether a lock is held, who held it, what value a branch was based on. Because each system maintains their state as if it was independent, the different parts of the state can get out-of-sync and be altered in unexpected ways (e.g., through a race condition or zombie process). It’s hard to implement robust logic and guarantee strong invariants that way.Having a single place (the one log) that forces a linear history of events as the ground truth and owns the decision of who can add to that ground truth, means we don’t have to coordinate much any more.Coordination avoidance is one of the few silver bullets in distributed systems - a way to reduce complexity, rather than shift it. For example, guarding our second code snippet with a ZooKeeper lock only shifted complexity. It reduced the code’s need to worry about concurrency, but introduced issues around lost locks and cleanup of persistent locks. In contrast, the approach to unify the different states in one log actually reduced work, which resulted in higher efficiency, fewer corner cases, and easier operations.I know what you’re thinking: That’s a nice thought experiment, but my queue/log doesn’t work like that, my database doesn’t follow some other log, and isn’t this breaking all rules for separation of concerns?This idea can serve as a conceptual blue-print for an architecture based on a log (e.g., Kafka) - a bit like “Turning the Database Inside Out”(maybe we should call this “Turning the Microservice Inside Out?”). In practice, today’s log implementations miss efficient built-in ways to track retries, make conditional-appends, link events into a journal, and would leave that to the application developer to implement. is an implementation of this idea. Restate Server is the broker that owns the upstream log and push-invokes the handlers with events (e.g., similar to AWS SNS and Event Bridge), ensuring reliable retries after crashes. Every event gets the latest  (set of linked events) attached, just as described in the thought experiment above. Restate uses bi-directional streaming protocols (e.g., HTTP/2) to invoke the event handlers and send journal events and acknowledgements back and forth.The server issues a unique epoch to every invocation and retry, which the SDK attaches to every journal event that it sends, allowing the server to reject events from subsumed handler executions .The code snippet shows the example in Restate’s API (here TypeScript, but Java, Kotlin, Python, Go, and Rust are supported as well). The code does not explicitly append log events, but rather uses an SDK for actions, and the SDK interacts with the log.To persist intermediate steps (line 8), handlers use the SDK (), which sends the event to the log and awaits the ack of the conditional append to the event’s . On retries, the SDK checks the  whether the step’s event already exists and restores the result from there directly.Messages to other handlers are transported with exactly-once semantics (line 16). Message and RPC events are both added to the journal and routed to the destination handler. Similar to , the journal deduplicates the message-sending steps. Because messages result in a single durable invocation (sequence of retries that share a journal), you can easily build end-to-end exactly-once semantics on top of this.Restate supports handlers that lock a key when executing (and hold the lock across retries). Those handlers can read and update state that is scoped to that key. They are implemented similarly to the thought experiment: The lock and state update events are added to the journal and additionally processed by an embedded lock service and K/V store, making locks and state virtually incorruptible through partial failures, race conditions, zombie processes, etc.These stateful handlers can be grouped together to share state. Restate calls that a , because the handlers are like methods with access to the object instance’s state. The state is infinitely retained in the K/V store, even when the log events eventually get garbage collected.There are more building blocks in Restate, including persistent Futures/Promises, , or  . They all build on the same concept: Events routed through the same log, stored in the journal, and processed into a database or scheduler.Applications often aim to create the behavior of  for their critical functions. The single-log approach provides that with a single dependency and without coordination across queues, DBs, locks, and schedulers. Restate implements that pattern.It would not make sense to use a single log for every operation in a distributed multi-service architecture. While it could give interesting properties, this would couple services too tightly, create a single giant blast radius, and void many benefits of service-oriented designs.The sweet-spot we target with Restate’s implementation of this idea, is to drive all state that is strictly scoped to a handler or service through the log, plus transport of messages between services. The result is a coupling and blast radius similar to any event-driven service: If the upstream queue/log is down, the service cannot be invoked.State in a database or in the log? #We assume that Restate is not going to replace general purpose databases. Shared databases should and will remain a part of the infrastructure, and continue to do what they are great at.The K/V state built on the log is a great fit for state machines (like the status of a payment), temporary state when joining/aggregating events and signals, or really any state that is purely updated through the event-driven handlers and scoped around a key (though a key may be something broader, like an aggregate root in Domain Driven Design).It also gives you the building blocks for a highly robust and consistent core state. You can even use that to build overlays over other stores, track metadata like versions for entries in databases, or build data structures like semaphores. Here is an example of how to use this to make exactly-once updates to databases from handlers.If you want to try this pattern out for yourself and see and feel this idea in action, Restate is open source and you can download it at https://restate.dev/get-restate/Today, Restate runs on a single node - similar to a Postgres database server. , supporting replication, scale out deployments, working with object store snapshots - stay tuned for more exciting updates during that release.With the release, we will publish Part 2 of this article, which is looking at the design of the broker that maintains that log, drives the execution, retries, and implements the extensible logic to use the log for communication, locking, journaling, state, signals, scheduling, etc. As you might expect, if the core abstraction is a log, that system is a specific type of event-driven architecture.In Part 3 of this series, we look at the implementation of the log that backs everything. Why not just use Kafka? Or just use Postgres?
In this case, we opted to develop a new type of log - something that generally one shouldn’t do, but once in a while, there is actually a good case for it. We believe that this is one of those cases, and will discuss the details of the log design, what makes it unique, and what it can do that’s hard to do with any existing implementation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Profiling and Optimising Go Code</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1i8vsrl/profiling_and_optimising_go_code/</link><author>/u/greatdharmatma</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 13:49:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/greatdharmatma ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TIL: large capacity slices/maps in sync.Pool can waste memory</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1i8vbyh/til_large_capacity_slicesmaps_in_syncpool_can/</link><author>/u/lzap</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 13:26:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was browsing Go standard library I found this:var bufferPool = sync.Pool{New: func() any { return new([]byte) }} func getBuffer() *[]byte { p := bufferPool.Get().(*[]byte) *p = (*p)[:0] return p } func putBuffer(p *[]byte) { // Proper usage of a sync.Pool requires each entry to have approximately // the same memory cost.

ABSTRACT
Aaron is at the forefront of shaping the standards that govern online authentication. In this session, Aaron will share his insights into the evolving landscape of identity and access management, highlighting key trends, challenges, and best practices. Drawing on his experience as the editor of OAuth 2.1 and other specifications, Aaron will discuss the future of OAuth and its impact on developers and security professionals.

This session will cover everything from the origins of OAuth to protect users from having to share their credentials with third-party apps, to modern-day uses of OAuth ranging everywhere from advanced token exchange use cases to being the underpinnings of secure identity in the enterprise. Expect takeaways on securing applications at scale and understanding the next generation of identity protocols. [...]

We’ll look at why they’re not supported and show you some clever workarounds.Typescript is closely aligned with  from mathematics. We know this because Typescript supports set operations with types, such as Union, Intersection, Concatenation…But there is no support for Type subtraction, or in other words .For example, you can’t say something like . But there is a cool trick you can use as a workaround.This trick works best in generic function arguments. Take a look at this handler function that accepts all strings except :It’s not perfect, and you can see this workaround only works in specific contexts, but given that there is rarely a need for type subtraction, it does make sense why Typescript wouldn’t support it natively.TypeScript uses a structural type system. That means it only cares about the structure of data rather than their names. This is why  don’t exist in TypeScript.But let's say you want to distinguish between absolute and relative file path strings. Treating them as interchangeable could lead to bugs later down the line.Conveniently, you can simulate nominal types by creating “branded types”:This is a neat trick that works for all use cases. I would love to hear situations where you would use it in the comments.TypeScript will never officially support negated types or nominal types, but their workarounds still promise good results.Do you know other features Typescript is avoiding to add?

Medvedchuk, who was under house arrest in Kyiv pending treason charges when the Russian invasion began, was caught attempting to flee the country by the Security Service of Ukraine in April 2022.

DESCRIPTION
Tod Golding, author of "Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) ", discusses the critical need for collaboration between business and technical roles in organizations adopting a SaaS model with Bill Tarr. He advocates for a top-down vision that encourages non-technical roles, such as finance and operations, to engage deeply with technical teams, fostering a service mindset rather than a sole focus on product features.

Tod highlights the importance of operational insights in multi-tenant environments, where effective monitoring of tenant behaviors is essential to prevent issues before they impact customers. He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.

Looking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.

Could Europe be next?</title><link>https://www.newsweek.com/reddit-banning-x-links-2019994</link><author>/u/newsweek</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 10:14:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[European officials continue to discuss punishments against X, formerly Twitter, including the possibility of a ban while Elon Musk's controversial gesture at the presidential inauguration prompted a boycott of the platform by some communities on popular message board site Reddit. reached out to X and the European Commission for comment by email on Thursday morning.Elon Musk has stirred no end of controversy in recent months following the election of President Donald Trump to a second term in office. Musk played a major role in financially backing Trump and also promoting him on X.Additionally, Musk stirred controversy this week when he made a gesture that many have interpreted as a Nazi salute, which Musk has denied and wholesale rejected as an attack by "radical leftists." Those who have denied the gesture as a Nazi salute instead argued that Musk was trying to "send my heart" to the crowd or was making a Roman salute.However, some different Reddit sub-pages have taken the decision to ban users from posting X links as a form of protest against Musk: The Formula 1 subreddit is the highest-profile group to adopt the ban, followed by the PC gaming subreddit and the pro-Ukraine subreddit NAFO.As a "very large platform" with over 45 million users per the DSA classification, X is required (among other things) to "identify, analyze, and assess systemic risks that are linked to their services," particularly illegal context, risks to fundamental rights (including freedom of expression), risks to public security and electoral processes, and gender-based violence, public health and well being of minors.Some officials in Europe believe that X has failed to adhere to these commitments, but whether they can take action against the platform, and what action they can take, remains a complicated question.Jean Cattan, general secretary of France's National Digital Council (Cnum) has warned that trying to ban X is "not at all a simple path" while insisting that it remains "realistic but extreme," according to the AFP.In order to pursue any such ban, the E.U. would rely on either the Digital Services Act (DSA) or the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which came into effect in 2024. Former European Commissioner Thierry Breton argued that these two acts would allow the 27-member bloc to enforce a ban across all member states.Through the powers of the DSA, the European Union opened an investigation into X in 2023 over allegations the platform failed to address "illicit content and disinformation" following a significant decrease in X content moderation, according to .The AFP noted, however, that the DSA has "no provision ... for a platform to be banned for good," with a "maximum penalty" that can be ordered by a judge. A suspension would be a last resort after a fine of up to 6 percent of the platform's worldwide annual revenue.X is forecast to record around $2 billion in global ad revenue in 2024—a significant drop from its $4.5 billion revenue in 2022, according to British business magazine 's Asia branch.Cattan complained about the mechanism, telling the AFP that the recent troubles involving an alleged TikTok campaign backed by Russia to boost a far-right candidate proved "the DSA does not allow us to react swiftly enough."French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot earlier this month urged the European Commission to either apply "as strictly as possible the laws we've passed to protect our public space" or "agree to return the capacity to do this to the member states."Any action might have to happen through regulators in Ireland, where X has its European headquarters.Jordan Bardella, President of the French far-right party National Rally, In the video, Bardella suggested that French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wanted a ban on X.  determined that leaders have not called for a ban but have alluded to "action" against the platform if it has been deemed to have violated the DSA.Florian Philippot, leader of French nationalist and Eurosceptic party The Patriots, on X criticized Bardella for not voting against the DSA and accused the E.U. of "killing freedom of expression a little more every day."However, Chloe Ridel, European Member of Parliament for the Socialist Party, wrote on X: "Freedom of expression applies within the limits of the law, but it is not respected on X who: - rigs the algorithm to boost certain posts over others. - ⁠ allows hate speech to flourish. What is at stake is our sovereignty: would you therefore accept that an American billionaire puts up millions of election posters without control in France?"The investigation into X will continue, especially in light of Musk's repeated attacks against European officials over perceived violations of free speech. The European Commission just last week announced new steps to the investigation, with pressure increasing on investigators after Musk's chat with AfD leader Alice Weidel.There will also be increased scrutiny on X as the upcoming German election draws near, which is set to occur on February 23, 2025.Correction on 01/24/2025 at 9:20 a.m. ET. Corrects that the ban on X links is by some groups on Reddit]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Today, Croatia is boycotting stores because of inflation</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1i8s8ig/today_croatia_is_boycotting_stores_because_of/</link><author>/u/DefinitionPerfect575</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 10:13:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the World Is Preparing for Trump’s Tariffs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUYR-r30nfQ</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 09:00:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since President Donald Trump first threatened to impose sweeping tariffs against China and US trading partners during his election campaign, companies and businesses have been bracing for impact.

Multi-Zone Clusters Inside and Out - Tom Dean & Phil Henderson, Buoyant

Multi-zone clusters are a great tool for improving application reliability — and also a great way to spend a ton of cash. Why? What really happens when you set these things up? How do you use them effectively without bankrupting your whole organization? In this session, we'll dig into the nuts and bolts of what goes on under the hood of a multi-zone cluster, including what a zone is, what Kubernetes understands about zones, how zones affect routing, and why multi-zone clusters can drive costs up. We'll spend some time on Kubernetes' Topology Aware Routing, covering its advantages as well as its very real limitations. Finally, we'll dive into how you can influence Kubernetes' choices to take advantage of multi-zone clusters' reliability while containing costs.

Goodbye etcd! Running Kubernetes on Distributed PostgreSQL - Denis Magda, Yugabyte

Kubernetes once favored Etcd as a database for all cluster data. Back then, relational databases lacked the availability and scalability characteristics required by Kubernetes. However, as Etcd encountered challenges with various Kubernetes workloads, relational databases continued to evolve. This session is a practical guide for deploying fault-tolerant and scalable Kubernetes clusters on distributed PostgreSQL. We’ll begin with Kine, which integrates into the Kubernetes architecture, enabling relational databases for cluster metadata management. Then, we’ll use Kine to deploy Kubernetes on a single-server PostgreSQL instance. After that, we’ll migrate to a multi-node PostgreSQL instance, allowing Kubernetes to tolerate zone and region outages and scale to thousands of nodes on demand.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Oracle Linux 10 Developer Preview Released With UEK-Next Based On Linux 6.12</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Oracle-Linux-10-DP</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 01:33:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building off last month's release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.0 beta, Oracle today published the Oracle Linux 10 Developer Preview for a first glimpse at this next RHEL10-derived operating system...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Epic Games To Cover Developer iOS Fees</title><link>https://games.slashdot.org/story/25/01/23/2350253/epic-games-to-cover-developer-ios-fees?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Epic Games is expanding its mobile app store to include nearly 20 third-party games on Android and EU iOS, launching a free games program, and temporarily covering Apple's Core Technology Fee for participating developers to counter platform restrictions. "Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores in different places, but to build a single, cross-platform store in which, within the era of multi-platform games, if you buy a game or digital items in one place, you have the ability to own them everywhere," Epic CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters during a press briefing. The Verge reports: Under the program, Epic will offer new free games in the store each month before eventually switching to a weekly schedule. However, the games aren't actually in the store yet -- Epic said on Thursday that it "ran into a few bugs that we're working through now" and "we'll provide an update once the games are live and ready to play!"
 
To sweeten the deal for developers that participate in the free games program on iOS, Epic will help defray the cost of using third-party marketplaces. For one year, it will pay these developers' Core Technology Fee (CTF): a 50 euro cent fee levied on every install of an iOS app that uses third-party stores after it exceeds 1 million annual downloads. (Apple gives developers with less than 10 million euros in global revenue a three-year on-ramp.) [...] Epic writes in its blog post that covering the fee "is not financially viable for every third party app store or for Epic long term, but we'll do it while the European Commission investigates Apple's non-compliance with the law."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Efficient LLM Deployment: A Unified Approach with Ray, VLLM, and Kubernetes - Lily (Xiaoxuan) Liu</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3NW-gV1OtA</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:59:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Divide and Conquer: Master GPU Partitioning and Visualize Savings with OpenCost - Kayse Yu 

Kubernetes is the ideal platform for running AI and ML workloads, such as LLMs. GPU nodes are often used for their parallel processing capabilities and higher performance benefits; however, they are known to be costly. Many factors impact the cost of running AI/ML workloads such as GPU utilization, GPU VM size, idle time, etc. These costs are often ignored and considered inherent in running GPU workloads. But if running workloads at scale and left unoptimized, costs will quickly spin out of control. In this talk, we leverage NVIDIA DCGM exporter with Prometheus for GPU metrics monitoring alongside OpenCost to measure the Kubernetes spend of our GPU workloads. We will provide an overview of OpenCost, highlighting its role in bridging the gap between the developer and platform teams through visibility and accountability of spend. We will demonstrate how to use the NVIDIA GPU Operator and how techniques such as partitioning can lead to significant cost savings.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Managing and Distributing AI Models Using OCI Standards and Harbor - Steven Zou</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eiXSogHxmQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:02:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Unlocking the Future of GPU Scheduling in Kubernetes with Reinforcement Learning - Nikunj Goyal, Adobe Systems & Aditi Gupta, Disney Plus Hotstar

Scaling up Multi GPU setup using Kubernetes for large scale ML projects has been a hot topic equally stressed upon among both the AI and cloud community. While Kubernetes is able to providing computing power by scheduling GPU nodes, certain issues like resource fragmentation and low utilization plague the performance and results in cost issues. 

Why Reinforcement Learning (RL) in particular one would ask. Unlike the other algorithms, RL shines in its unique ability to continuously adapt to changing environments and efficiently handle Complex and Multi-dimensional Objectives making it particularly suitable for the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of Kubernetes clusters. In this talk, we shall explore the current landscape of GPU scheduling and some state of the art RL algorithms proposed for scheduling. Their current impact on Kubernetes and the possible use of RLHF shall be dived deep into.

One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has been doing just that.J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that’s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumin Technology’s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why So Many Ancient Civilizations Collapsed At The Same Time</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8YQuyjWks</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bronze Age collapse is perhaps one of the greatest disasters in human history and also one of the least understood.

The universe is expanding and that expansion is accelerating under the power of dark energy and eventually all matter and energy will be dispersed over such unthinkable distances that nothing can stop space from blowing up infinitely. Unless of course cosmologists blundered and dark energy doesn't even exist. Then it's back to the drawing board.

I'm one of the lead devs of this project at fal.ai and we created an open source lightweight video editor powered by the latest media AI models. The main goal was to tackle some challenges when dealing with complex media handling and encoding on the browser.It all started as an internal experiment but as we tackled some of the issues it was clear there could be some value sharing it with the open source community.Some of the key points and tech stack details:- It uses IndexedDb, so all data is local (i.e. no auth, no cloud db)- Multiple AI models for video, image, music and voice-over. APIs are provided by fal.ai- Built with the typical React+Next.js, Shadcn front-end- Used remotion.dev for the realtime video preview (this is such a great project, without it the codebase would be twice as large)- File uploads so you can bring your own media by uploadthing.com- ffmpeg for encoding the final video and also some ui tricks, like the audio waveformWe deployed a version of it and for now it's free to use. We do plan to add some rate limiting and a bring your own API Key next, but it's open source and I'm curious about what the community will build on top of it, or derive from it. Customize your own video app and if you do, please share.If you have any questions, hit me up!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2261 - Warren Smith</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7Hrq8WL1-g</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Warren Smith is an educator and founder of the Secret Scholars on YouTube.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

According to reports, minors are being sexually exploited in many bars in the red -light district. 

A DW documentary on sex tourism in Pattaya unleashed a wave of outrage after it was broadcast at the end of 2023. Thailand's national media picked up the story, focused on the case of a suspected German pedophile who managed to leave the country. Even the prime minister made a statement, following the documentary’s release.  

But what’s happened since then? How has the situation in Thailand changed?

The schools serve 60 million students and employ an unknown number of teachers. Besides providing software for administration, grades, and other functions, PowerSchool stores personal data for students and teachers, with much of that data including Social Security numbers, medical information, and home addresses.On January 7, PowerSchool revealed that it had experienced a network intrusion two weeks earlier that resulted in the “unauthorized exportation of personal information” customers stored in PowerSchool’s Student Information System (SIS) through PowerSource, a customer support portal. Information stolen included individuals’ names, contact information, dates of birth, medical alert information, Social Security Numbers, and unspecified “other related information.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers say new attack could take down the European power grid</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/could-hackers-use-new-attack-to-take-down-european-power-grid/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:00:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last month, researchers revealed a finding that’s likely to shock some people and confirm the low expectations of others: Renewable energy facilities throughout Central Europe use unencrypted radio signals to receive commands to feed or ditch power into or from the grid that serves some 450 million people throughout the continent.Fabian Bräunlein and Luca Melette stumbled on their discovery largely by accident while working on what they thought would be a much different sort of hacking project. After observing a radio receiver on the streetlight poles throughout Berlin, they got to wondering: Would it be possible for someone with a central transmitter to control them en masse, and if so, could they create a city-wide light installation along the lines of Project Blinkenlights?

HTTP Methods (Verbs) in REST APIsHTTP provides a set of  that define the type of operation to be performed on a resource.In RESTful architectures, these methods typically map to CRUD operations:It’s essential to use the correct HTTP method to make your API clear and intuitive. For example,  signals a read-only request to developers and should never modify server data, while  indicates data creation or an action that results in a change.2. REST is Resource-OrientedIn RESTful API design, data is represented as , and each resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).→ A collection (or list) of books → A specific book with ID 123An  is a combination of:An HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT etc.)A resource URI (, )Each endpoint represents a specific operation on a resource. → Fetch all books → Create a new book → Delete the book with ID 123Using clear and consistent endpoints helps developers quickly understand how to interact with your API.4. HTTP Status Codes: Understanding API ResponsesEach API response includes an , which indicates the result of the request.Using meaningful status codes is important for helping consumers of your API understand why a request might have failed and how they can fix or retry it.Common status codes include:: The request was successfully received and processed.: The request succeeded.: A new resource was successfully created.: The request succeeded, but there is no content to return.: Further action is needed to complete the request (e.g., a different endpoint or resource location).: There was an error in the request sent by the client.: The request was malformed or invalid.: Authentication is required or has failed.: The client does not have permission to access the resource.: The requested resource does not exist.: Rate limit exceeded.: The server encountered an error while processing the request.500 Internal Server Error: A general error occurred on the server.: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.1. Define Clear Resource Naming ConventionsUsing a consistent, intuitive, and hierarchical structure for API endpoints improves both readability and usability. The goal is to help developers quickly understand how to interact with your API without extensive documentation.Since REST is resource-oriented, focus on  (nouns) rather than  (verbs) for your endpoints. The HTTP methods (, , etc.) already describe the action, so using verbs in the URL are redundant.GET /getAllUsers
POST /createNewOrder
DELETE /removeProduct/123GET /users
POST /orders
DELETE /products/123]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built an active community of trans people online</title><link>https://t4t.social/</link><author>t4t</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:07:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Is something I have that if there for me always when I want cuddles… I don’t have a cuddle buddy so a hot futa woman on a body pillow is the next best thing.Someone message me I’m so bored I need conversation tbhhhI really want to be fucked passionately by a hung trans woman, God that's the dream.As she slowly enters me, gradually getting faster, rose pedals on the bed, while a candle light is our only light source.I’m so fucking horny right now but like lowkey I just want my ex but idk is that too much to say cuz ik he don’t fuck with me like that rn 😔 I’m just horny asf tbhI have the most abominable teammates in a ranked game of marvel rivalsgod i love dollification so much i wish i could play with a dolly rn]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Love letter from 1940&apos;s that Amy Tan&apos;s dad sent to her mom 🥰 #FindingYourRoots #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ifdDk5LMJs</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 05:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Henry Louis Gates, Jr. shares with Amy Tan the love letters from her father to her mother written in the 1940's which researchers found in Shanghai court archives.

Stories about drug use by Hitler and German forces during World War II have been widely told. What’s less well known is the Allied commanders’ embraced pharmacological “force enhancers” as well.  By 1941, rumors about Nazi soldiers using a “super-drug” identified as the methamphetamine Pervitin were confirmed, and Allied commanders launched their own classified program to find the perfect war-fighting drug.

– Nikola TeslaIt’s got a 4K AMOLED display, a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard, plays Minecraft at 4K, runs +7B LLMs, surfs the web, and has ~7h battery life. All open-source.How I Made A Laptop From Scratch (YouTube.com). Demo at 22:14.The writeup below pretty much abridges the video above.Imagine a skill-chart of qualities of technology: screen, audio, performance, build, tactility, touch-interaction, efficiency, size, and so many more. At the balancing point of all these qualities is the laptop. To that end, let’s build a laptop that hits as many qualities of a modern commercial thin & light laptop—while trying to do as much from scratch as possible.Booting and inserting magnetically attached keyboardEpic Hypixel Bedwars gamingFinding an electron in a cloudI first made a mental map and transferred it into Obsidian:Boiling it down, it landed me with a lofty list of goals:RK3588 SoC Motherboard
Powertrain
~60Wh Li-ion battery packPeripherals
Wireless mechanical keyboardGlass-topped multi-touch trackpadAnodized aluminum CNC chassisI looked towards single-board computer SoCs, as board manufacturers commonly release schematics for reference. In many aspects, the Rockchip RK3588 is the fastest consumer-procurable chip on the market. Despite the spotty software support, the hardware documentation has lots of developer resources and reference schematics from SBC manufacturers.Quad core A76 and quad core A55I/O: 8K display, dual USB3.1, PCIe 3.0 x 4, HDMI2.1/eDP 1.4, etc.With only a few months to work on this project, an SoM (system on module) like the Raspberry Pi CM5 presented the best option for its hardware compatibility and a high likelihood of a snug integration. Choosing an SoM also alleviates memory and other high-speed signaling concerns. Looking around for a RK3588 SoM, I came across the CM3588 by FriendlyElec. Cheap, well-documented, and easily procurable. Sounds good!I hopped on panelook.com and filtered by size and resolution. I’ve always been a sucker for high pixel density, so I went with a 4K AMOLED 13.3” display. Cross referencing stock availability on Taobao (Chinese domestic Aliexpress), the ATNA33TP11 seemed to be the one with most  stock since OLED risked burn-in.A highlight: during display evaluation, switching out a connector and shortening the board by 2mm improved signal integrity  for the 1.5GHz x 4 signals go pass through. Getting the display running on Linux meant finding system logs from Asus laptops that have this display, reverse-engineering the values, and tuning the power-on timings amongst other things . TLDR; getting a 4K AMOLED eDP display running on non-mainline Linux was a heck of a journey, so read this if you’re interested (coming soon).ATNA33TP11 working with display evaluation board V2 shortThe cells had to be 6mm thin and four packs lined up should take roughly half of the entire chassis volume. Chinese manufacturers don’t stock batteries readily, and shipping them to the US would be a pain. Thus, I looked on the American side. I stumbled upon with these batteries from AA Portable Power Corp. or batteryspace.com. or Powerizer. Doing the power calculations, we get: 4.250Ah  4S = 62.9 Wh with max 8A (so max 134.4W discharge)! Solid.The total voltage is 4.2V (peak) * 4S = 16.8V. The system’s designed for up to 20V USB-C (AKA 100W) and passed into the BQ25713 charging IC. The batteries are balanced with the BQ77915 to ensure safe charging, and the power is tracked with an LTC2943 to calculate a state-of-charge percentage. I popped in an ESP32-S3 module as the controller for everything, and set it to production.After writing drivers and sitting on the undecipherable datasheets for days, I had the batteries charging. I successfully load tested it to around 5A and powered the full system. There’s still a lot of quiescent current (about ~50mA), but I haven’t had the time to optimize the firmware.The USB of the ESP32 connects to the internal USB on the motherboard to feed the power telemetry over UART. A Python script and kernel module in the OS forwards it to the battery service in the kernel to display it natively.Powertrain V0.2 inside laptopIn settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scrollWith those decisions made up, I aimed for >90mm motherboard width based on a prelim CAD from the batteries and display dimensions.On the physical I/O side, I settled on dual USB3.1 Type-C ports, a USB2.0 Type-A port, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. Internally, the M.2 E-key connects to an RTL8852BE WiFi 6 (802.11ax) + BT5.2 wireless card and the M.2 M-key accommodates up to an 2242-sized NVMe SSD. A full size NVMe SSD can fit with some modifications of the chassis too.Tangent over, this leaves me with around ~90mm of board height. Implementing all the features on the final mainboard would stretch this writeup too long, so read this if you’re interested (coming soon).In settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scrollDetailed hardware overviewJoshua Riek’s ubuntu-rockchip kernel/distro combined an out-of-the-box experience with lots of optimizations. Using Armbian’s kernel (I believe it’s still off Rockchip’s kernel) meant that it offered nearly all the features of the RK3588 on a developer-ready kernel configuration.Since nearly all the work I needed to do was abstracted in the DeviceTree (DTS) hardware configuration language implemented with U-boot, the bootloader, I took advantage of their system-agnostic nature to speed up my trial-and-error process having never done any Linux work.Instead of developing and compiling code on the RK3588 itself, I used my daily driver MacBook and Visual Studio Code. Once I made a change in the DTS, I’d use Orbstack (virtualization software) running Ubuntu 24.04 (shared filesystem and kernel with macOS) and compile the DeviceTree there.Pointing U-Boot to a custom compiled DTB (devicetree binary), I ’ed the compiled  to the OS. A  regenerates the bootloader configurations, and a reboot updates the changes.That’s how I did the hardware bringup—display configurations, PCIe, USB, and other low-level system tweaks. The rest is just a standard install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with Linux Kernel 6.1.Testing batteries and writing DTSIn-depth software overviewImagine being able to just pull out your laptop’s keyboard and use it as just another wireless keyboard for literally anything! Just me? Maybe.Being a mechanical keyboard addict with quite a few ZMK keyboards designed, I chose the Cherry MX ULP mechanical switches for the best feel. Of course, a battery and fully mechanical switches add  of height. I used a 1mm thin 200mAh battery and a custom battery protection board that sticks up between two rows of keys to cut down on ~1.6mm (PCB height). The nRF52840 SoC running ZMK Firmware is right underneath the spacebar. A sandwich of PLA and 6061 aluminum from Fabworks crammed everything under ~7mm.Since the keycaps aren’t easily procurable, I got a 0.15mm nozzle for my Bambu Lab X1C and printed them with PLA. It got me down a rabbit hole of tungsten nozzles, and I got quoted ~$400 for 20x 0.15mm nozzles. I’ve been thinking of trying that out too. But alas, printing out all the keycaps and assembling for the last time, the keyboard was done.Moving on to the trackpad, it was quite quick. I knew from the start that I wanted a good trackpad, so making my own with zero capacitive tracking experience is a no-go. Searching online, I came across the Azoteq PXM0057-401 evaluation module on Mouser. It had it all—glass surface, multi-touch, and worked over USB. And, it was only 35 bucks or so. However, the trackpad has ceased production without many alternatives.With the keyboard and trackpad working, it was time to put on the finishing touches.In settings, tick “Align controls with KiCad” for mouse pan/zoom/scroll*Counterclockwise from top left: keyboard side profile, typing on keyboard, trackpad, 1mm battery on back, nRF52840 SoC areaOnShape wireframe exploded viewRoughly the same time I began the system design, I sent a few CNC aluminum blocks off to JLC for evaluation with different anodization finishes. The dark gray anodization felt “best”, but I preferred the look of the matte black, so I settled on that.
Using PTC OnShape, I (attempted) CAD’ed a robust and minimalistic look and a blend of my two favorite laptop lineup designs, the Razer Blade and the MacBook Pro. Because of the removable keyboard, the bottom has no screws. Instead, the palm rest screws into the bottom chassis. CAD Link here.The hardest part about the chassis was the hinge. I used Framework’s 13.3” hinge because it has a 3D model. I constrained it in OnShape so I can see the exact closing angles.The chassis layout is fairly simple: batteries on the bottom, the power board on the right, motherboard on the left, and the hinge mechanism on top. Oh, and a transparent PETG FDM printed power button that lights up on a custom PCB. To balance out the asymmetric hinge (caused by the mainboard being too wide), a little carbon fiber rod lines up on the left side too.It was a battle to get the screen assembly to not hit anything while also covering
Although I started considering thermals way in advance, hence the gap here for the heatpipe to go through, I still had difficulty fitting everything in. The distance between the bottom of the keyboard and the top of the heatsink is less than a half a millimeter. The cooling system is really constrained because I don’t have the resources to make a custom heatpipe and fin solution. So, I made a full copper CNC heatsink (from JLCCNC) and a heatpipe connected to a fan. It’s all connected with PTM7950.I also added these PUI audio speakers on either side. The audio from the CM3588’s DAC didn’t work and I ran out of debugging time, so I made a USB to audio converter board separately and shot it through an Class-D amplifier. I would’ve also made the amp, but I ran out of time.As I reached final assembly, I used a mix of JLC’s selective laser sintering (SLS) of nylon powder and FDM printed PA6-CF for smaller structural parts. Putting it all together with the matte black CNC aluminum chassis, I finally had my laptop.Inside full laptop assemblyThe hardest class I’ve taken so far was quantum mechanics in my junior spring term. A few months before spending hours solving time-independent and dependent Schrödinger equations, I was on the squash bus (the sport, not the vegetable). My friend suggested I make a laptop for my senior project—and that was all.
I came up with the name anyon_e in June, after I finished the quantum course.Making this laptop was hard. Mentally pressured with a deadline, and a constant inter-disciplinary challenge across electrical, software, and mechanical systems. Summing up everything I’ve ever done. It took up most of my mind from May until now.Inspired by open-source projects like ZMK, KiCAD, Blender, and countless OSHW projects, I want to do my own little part. To put power in people’s hands in creation, innovation, imagination, or whatever else. To attempt the impossible.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to improve your WFH lighting to reduce eye strain</title><link>https://rustle.ca/posts/articles/work-from-home-lighting</link><author>jahfer</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:08:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I work from home everyday, I am susceptible to eye strain, eye pain, and dizziness. Having a working environment that’s as easy on my eyes as possible is of critical importance. I hope that by sharing what I've learned, it can be helpful to you if you work from home, and like many, have experienced WFH eye strain.Disclaimer: I'm not an ergonomist or optometrist. These tips are intended to help improve your work from home comfort based on my own personal experience.An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyesWhen it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too littleUse natural light wherever possible Quality of artificial light mattersThe best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomicsEven the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and take care of yourselfWhat is it about computer screens that makes them fatiguing?Most monitors have some level of flicker. This flickering is generally not visually noticeable, but can still be fatiguing. Monitors at lower brightness levels exhibit more flicker - as they use PWM dimming (Pulse Width Modulation). In some monitors this is done by changing the ON/OFF intervals, increasing OFF timing, and lowering ON timing — while maintaining the same brightness! This creates an awful strobe-effect, and can be very exhausting — especially when working in an environment where the monitor is the sole light source.High contrast lighting can exist in a few different formats. It can exist as  — that is for example light coming in from a window, into a dark room, illuminating a part of your desk. This glare is fatiguing on your eyes because they are accommodating for two levels of brightness simultaneously, while also trying to conduct tasks on a computer monitor — such as reading. High contrast can also exist in a room with bright light on the left, and darkness on the right. This is fatiguing for your eyes to compensate for.When working at a computer, most of the time and the don't move significantly. We focus at the same distances for long periods of time. This causes our eye muscles to get tight and overworked. This can cause our eyes to get tired, spasm, or sometimes even make it very hard to relax our eyes. Although improved office lighting can help with this, the main way to solve for this problem is to take breaks practicing the 20/20/20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look up from your screen and focus on something approximately 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.Light in the office primarily comes in from the sun. The direct light causes glare, and because of the lack of diffusion, makes for dark corners in the room. Even with a light overhead, it's not enough to equal the amount from outside. This results in high contrast, dark spots behind the monitor, and harsh shadows. Blackout curtains are of little help because they only serve to reduce the size of the light coming in, as opposed to aiding with diffusion. Anytime it's dark outside, it's like working at night. Not fun.Light primarily comes from above. Because of this single light source, it makes for harsh shadows, dark spots, and high contrast. The contrast issue is particularly apparent with the monitor, which although can be dimmed, creates a bright monitor, which also self-shades the wall behind resulting in a dark background.Window light sources, and filtering lightWindows now have light-filtering curtains, which helps to not only reduce the amount of light on bright days, but also to heavily diffuse the light coming in, which makes for a beautiful glow in the room. In addition, I've installed wood-blinds (not shown) behind the curtains which helps to further control the amount of light entering the office on very bright days.Products used: Sheer curtains • Wood BlindsEach corner of the room now has a torchiere lamp, which helps to create an even lighting environment. These lamps point directly up and light the room indirectly through reflections off of the walls and ceiling. In the center of the ceiling, a fabric wrapped light fixture provides  diffused lighting. This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to match the amount of light from the standing lamps. The desk now has even lighting. The brightness of the monitor is now matched by a dimmable flicker-free backlight, which makes working at the display less fatiguing. In addition, a monitor lightbar (not shown), provides indirect light to the desk, reflected off the surface which is completely dimmable and flicker-free. These two lights together help to make for an even lighting environment during the day, and a calm and cozy environment at night. In addition to the two lights, the Apple Studio display has an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the brightness to match the ambient light, which is a game changer for light sensitive people. An even, diffused lighting environment is best for the eyes. Try to balance out dark/light spots with additional lighting, and diffusing strong light sources — like the sun.When it comes to light brightness, too much is just as problematic as too little. When dealing with too little light, add additional light sources which provide indirect, and reflective lights — such as up-lights, or torchieres, or lights that have a shade. When dealing with too much light — use blinds, sheer curtains, or light filtering curtains. If you have too much light from an artificial source, use lower wattage bulbs, or consider adding a dimmer switch.Use natural light wherever possible. If you've got natural light, use it to your advantage. Natural light is healthier than artificial light — there's no flicker, and it can provide us with much needed vitamin D. For rooms with small windows, use mirrors to help reflect natural light and fill the room. Quality of Artificial Light Matters. Wherever possible seek out high quality lighting that is dimmable and flicker-free. Spending a few extra dollars for these products is worth it, and it will result in less fatigue. For regular bulbs, I recommend Philipps Ultra Definition LED Soft Whitebulbs which have low flicker rates, glass enclosures, high color rendering index, and a relatively inexpensive pricepoint.The best lighting for camera, is not necessarily the best lighting for ergonomics. When working from home, we spend a lot of time on video calls, and it's natural to want to look our best. Studio lights that attach to our desks, or facing a window outdoor will result in great lighting on camera, but can also cause fatigue. Consider reserving this lighting for calls, or see if generally better room lighting can result in a similar light quality on camera.Even the perfect lighting environment will fatigue you — take breaks, and think beyond lighting! Having a great lighting environment will help you with stamina, but having good work habits like the 20/20/20 rule, and changing up posture and working environments are important in order to take the best care of your eyes, and your body. Think beyond lighting when considering ergonomics, such as room humidity (to limit dry eye), posture, chair position, and stay moving to keep blood flowing.It may seem daunting, but I believe that with some small changes it can make a big difference. I hope this gives you new ideas to try, and I'd love to hear what you are doing in your own office as well! Cheers!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kyle&apos;s Frat Party</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c1OWon1MSo</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:07:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To see our new movie 'Dear Kelly,' head over to https://www.dearkellyfilm.com/, where it is available for purchase OR $5.55/rental.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dark web PHP dev Ross Ulbricht released from prison…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-wuoIDdjw</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:04:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ross Ulbricht received a presidential pardon for his crimes related to the Silk Road.

Panpsychism is the extreme claim that everything in the physical world—all subatomic particles-are in some sense ‘conscious’ or have a basic kind of ‘proto-consciousness’. Why are an increasing number of leading philosophers taking panpsychism seriously? Something must be up. Could it be doubt that the scientific project to explain consciousness has failed?

I assume they scrape cell phone numbers from WhitePages and just spray-and-pray hoping to get a response.My parents own some undeveloped land in the middle of town which lies mostly in a flood zone and the usable acreage is much less than it appears on paper.  Of course the brokers don't know this, so the prospect of buying up a big plot which has been vacant for decades for cheap probably gets their mouths watering.Over Christmas break I worked on a system for controlling my phone's SMS application over MQTT from a remote workstation running Ollama.

The first step is to forward text messages somehow to the LLM workstation.  There are several SMS forwarding tools on both F-Droid and the Play store, but most of them only supported one-way forwarding received SMS via POST request to some REST endpoint.  I saw one application which supports POSTing messages back to the phone, but since the phone is behind a CGLAN, I really wanted some kind of long-running socket connection to the workstation.I ended up finding the verbosely named Android-SMS-Gateway-MQTT, which runs in the background and waits to send/receive messages and works without changing the default messaging app.For some reason the app can be commanded to send messages via MQTT, but received messages are forwarded via POST request only.  I made some modifications to use MQTT for communication both ways.I really don't enjoy touching Android development, so I gave a shot at using Cursor.ai to make the changes and it worked perfectly first try!  The prompt I used is below:[SMSListener.java (41-46)]
How do I turn this POST request into an MQTT message?  I'd like to use the MQTT connection already present in the file `BackgroundService.java` if possible.
Disabling battery optimization is necessary for the application to run reliably in the background.  Fortunately the power consumption for the app is insignificant.  The .apk is available in the project files.The job of the Python script is simply to listen on MQTT for new SMS messages and send generated LLM responses back to the Android application.
I want the language model to be able to give responses that make sense in context, so I store each ongoing conversation in a separate JSON file and feed the last N messages to the language model when generating responses.[
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I forgore to register for ece500 :("
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "that sucks bro, did u talk to the prof about gettin in tho?"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Tf"
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "lol what's that supposed to mean, are u gonna try to crash the class or somethin?"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello"
    },

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "hey whats good, just got back from leg day and i'm hella sore btw"
    },

        "content": "Ok bro"
    }

A big part of the fun is being able to create different ridiculous personalities and backstories.  The Python script reads from a config where I can assign different personalities to conversations.The Ollama TUI also makes it really convenient to experiment with different prompts and update these personas.  I don't even have to restart the script![evan@copernicus ~] ollama run llama3.3

>>> /set system "you are a college bro responding via SMS.  you want to sell your property.  you only respond with single sentences and use millenial speak. your responses are very short and you don't capitalize letters.  you always want to sell.  everything you write is lowercase and your property is for sale. you should be open to negotiation and accept even low offers"

Set system message.

>>> Hey this is Bob with [redacted].  We're looking to buy vacant land near the one you own in [redacted].  Are you interested in a fair offer?

my property in [redacted] goes hard and i'm down to sell for a lowkey decent price, hit me with an offer fam

>>> /save llama3.3bro
Experimentation in the Ollama shellAnd now for what you've been waiting for!  The first message in these screenshots is written by me to get the other person to respond after I've whitelisted the conversation.  These chats are all I have at the moment, but I may come back and add more as more spam rolls in.I started off the project using Phi4, but I had difficulty keeping the LLM responses short.  After switching to llama3.3, this seems to have improved a lot.I'm not sure what the legal implications are of agreeing to sell land that I don't even own, so lately I've instructed the models to never actually close on anything.People have mentioned that responding to SMS spam helps the spammers to "warm up" a number and build carrier reputation so they can send more spam texts.  I figure that reporting and blocking the numbers after I've had my fun is a reasonable compromise.I do get some spam calls in addition to texts, but I haven't noticed an increase in either quite yet.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Arch Linux Installer Adds Wayfire As A Desktop Option, Btrfs Improvements</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Arch-Linux-Archinstall-3.0.2</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 19:10:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Archinstall 3.0.2 was just tagged as the newest version of this quick and easy, text-based installer for the Arch Linux operating system...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Leads the Way in 2025 IEEE Tech Impact Study</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/2025-ieee-tech-impact-study</link><author>Kathy Pretz</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 19:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tech leaders also ranked cloud computing and robotics as most important]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Free Software Foundation Marking 40 Years Old With A New Logo</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Free-Software-FSF-40-Year-Logo</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 18:12:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In October it will mark 40 years since the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded by Richard Stallman.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Documented terror - Where are Syria&apos;s missing prisoners? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptuDWhSTFl0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Burns, strangulation, broken bones. The list of signs of torture is long and can be seen on some 27,000 photos showing dead Syrian civilians. The man who smuggled the photos out of the country calls himself "Caesar”.

During the long decades of the Assad regime, hundreds of thousands of people disappeared inside its torture centers.  For years, "Caesar” worked as a photographer for the Syrian military, taking pictures of civilians tortured to death and documenting their cases. Who are the dead, what was their fate, and why did they disappear? Throughout Europe, the families of the victims, supported by international lawyers, activists and Caesar himself, are searching for truth and justice. They are investigating the Syrian death machine and the actions of its officials. Before the collapse of the regime in December 2024, this was both difficult and dangerous, there was always the risk that investigations based abroad could endanger further the lives of those behind Assad’s bars.

Is the enlightenment generated by meditation an altered state of consciousness, as much as can be induced by psychoactive chemicals like alcohol? Or is there something special about enlightenment that can illuminate the deep nature of consciousness and can even reach to ultimate levels of existence? Mystics make these grand claims.

The misconfiguration persisted for nearly five years until a security researcher spent $300 to register the domain and prevent it from being grabbed by cybercriminals.A DNS lookup on the domain az.mastercard.com on Jan. 14, 2025 shows the mistyped domain name a22-65.akam.ne.From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider [DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in “akam.net” but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain “.”This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by , founder of the security consultancy Seralys. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of Niger.Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn’t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include “akam.ne,” but they were by far the largest.But the researcher said he didn’t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.“We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,” a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. “This typo has now been corrected.”Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through , a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via a post on LinkedIn (after he’d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.MasterCard’s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. “Titon” on infosec.exchange.Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.“I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,” Caturegli wrote in reply. “Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.” Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard’s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like  and .“So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,” Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or “Time To Live” — a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network — an attacker’s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.“With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,” he said.The researcher said he’d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.“We obviously disagree with this assessment,” Caturegli wrote in a follow-up post on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard’s public statement. “But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.”Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain.As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain . It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft’s  cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.“Don’t be like Mastercard,” Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. “Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.”One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously — in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an “Ivan I.” from Moscow. Passive DNS records from DomainTools.com show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.This is interesting given a comment on Caturegli’s LinkedIn post from an ex-Cloudflare employee who linked to a report he co-authored on a similar typo domain apparently registered in 2017 for organizations that may have mistyped their AWS DNS server as “” instead of “.” DomainTools reports that this typo domain also was registered to a Yandex user (playlotto@yandex.ru), and was hosted at the same German ISP — Team Internet (AS61969).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Stratoshark, a sibling application to Wireshark</title><link>https://stratoshark.org/</link><author>geraldcombs</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:25:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

Here are some of them:The risk of error increases if a single authority decides the moderation policies.There’s a risk of bias when a single authority makes moderation decisions.Managing moderation at scale needs a lot of effort; it becomes a bottleneck.So they set up Bluesky: a research initiative to build a decentralized social network.A decentralized architecture distributes control across many servers.Here are 3 popular decentralized architectures in distributed systems:Federated architecture: client-server model; but different people run parts of the system and parts communicate with each other.Peer-to-Peer architecture: there’s no difference between client and server; each device acts as both.Blockchain architecture: distributed ledger for consensus and trustless interactions between servers.Bluesky uses a federated architecturefor its familiar client-server model, reliability, and convenience. So each server could be run by different people and servers communicate with each other over HTTP.Think of the federated network as email; a person with Gmail can communicate with someone using Protonmail.Yet building a decentralized social network at scale is difficult.So smart engineers at Bluesky used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):They created a decentralized open-source framework to build social networking apps, called Authenticated Transfer Protocol (), and built Bluesky on top of it.Put simply, Bluesky doesn’t run separate servers; instead, ATProto servers distribute messages to each other.A user’s data is shared across apps built on ATProto; Bluesky is one of the apps. So if a user switches between apps on ATProto, such as a photo-sharing app or blogging app, they don’t lose their followers (social graph).Imagine ATProto as Disneyland Park and Bluesky as one of its attractions. A single ticket is enough to visit all the attractions in the park. And if you don’t like one of the attractions, try another one in the park.Here’s how Bluesky works:A post is a short status update by a user; it includes text and images. The text content and timestamp of the post are stored in a . Think of the repository as a collection of data published by a single user.SQLite is used as its data layer for simplicity; each repository gets a separate SQLite database.The data records are encoded in CBOR, a compact binary format, before storing it in SQLite for low costs.Repositories of different users are stored on a ; they set up many data servers for scale.A data server exposes HTTP to handle client requests. Put simply, the data server acts as a proxy for all client interactions. Also it manages user authentication and authorization. The data server includes tooling to automatically apply updates in the federated architecture.They run 6 million user repositories on a single data server at 150 USD per month.Think of the user repository as a Git repo and the data server as GitHub. It’s easy to move a Git repo from GitHub to GitLab. Similarly, a user repository is movable from one data server to another.Besides it’s possible to use alternative clients for Bluesky. Yet it’s necessary to maintain a standard data schema for interactions. So separate  and API endpoints are defined for each app on ATProto, including Bluesky.A user's repository doesn’t store information about actions performed by their followers such as comments or likes on their post. Instead, it’s stored only in the repository of the follower who took the action.A post is shown to the user’s followers.Yet it’s expensive to push updates to each follower’s repository. So information is collected from every data server using the .The crawler doesn’t index data but forwards it.The crawler subscribes for updates on the data server: new posts, likes, or comments.The data server notifies the crawler about updates in real time over websockets.The crawler collects information from data servers and generates a .Consider the generated stream as a log over websockets; put simply, the crawler combines each user’s actions into a single TCP connection.A user's post is shown to followers only after counting the likes, comments, and reposts on it.Yet the stream doesn’t contain this information. So the stream’s data is aggregated using the ; it transforms raw data into a consumable form by processing it. Imagine the index server as a data presentation layer.The index server is built using the Go language for concurrency. A NoSQL database, ScyllaDB, is used as its data layer for horizontal scalability.A reference to the user's post ID is added to the follower’s repository when they like or repost a post. So the total number of likes and reposts is calculated by crawling every user repository and adding the numbers.Here’s the workflow for displaying a post:A user’s request is routed via their data server to the index server.The data server finds the people a user follows by looking at their repository.The index server creates a list of post IDs in reverse chronological order.The index server expands the list of post IDs to full posts with content.The index server then responds to the client.In short, a user repository stores primary data, while the index server stores derived data from repositories.The index server is the most read-heavy service; so, its results are cached using Redis, an in-memory storage, for performance.JSON Web Token () is used for authentication between Bluesky services.Media files, such as images and videos, are stored on the data server’s disk for simplicity. A cryptographic ID () is used to reference the media files in the repository. The index server fetches the media files from the data server on user request and caches them on the content delivery network () for efficiency.A user updates only their repository when they follow someone. Their repository adds a reference to the user’s unique decentralized identifier () to indicate follow.The number of followers for a user is found by indexing every repository. This is similar to how Google finds inbound links to a web page; all documents on the web are crawled.A user account includes a handle based on the domain name (); it keeps things simple.And each user automatically gets a handle from the ‘bsky.social’ subdomain upon account creation. Yet posts are stored using DID, and the user handle is displayed along with the posts. So changes to a user's handle don’t affect their previous posts.A user’s DID is immutable, but the handle is mutable; put simply, a user’s handle is reassignable to a custom domain name.Here’s how a user handle with a custom domain name is verified on Bluesky:The user enters their custom domain name in the Bluesky account settings.Bluesky generates a unique text value for the user: public key.The user stores this value in the DNS TXT record of the custom domain name.The index server then periodically checks the DNS TXT record and validates the user handle. Imagine  as a text data field for domain name settings.3. User Timeline and FeedA user’s timeline is created by arranging their posts in reverse chronological order.Yet a user’s repository doesn’t contain information about likes and comments received on a post. So the request is sent to the index server; it returns the user’s timeline with aggregated data.A feed is created from posts by people a user follows.Bluesky supports feeds with custom logic, and there are 50K+ custom feeds available. Consider the  as a filter for a specific list of keywords or users.The crawler generates a stream from data servers.The feed generator filters, sorts, and ranks the content based on custom logic.The feed generator creates a list of post IDs.The index server then populates the feed’s content on a user request. is used to fetch the feed; it offers better performance. It includes an extra parameter in API requests and responses. The cursor parameter points to a specific item in the dataset; for example, the post’s timestamp to fetch feed until a specific post.A sequential unique column, such as the post's timestamp, is chosen for pagination.The user requests include the cursor parameter to indicate the result’s offset.The index server uses the cursor parameter to paginate the result dataset.The index server responds with the cursor parameter for future requests.The client decides the cursor parameter’s window size based on its viewport. The cursor-based pagination scales well as it prevents a full table scan in the index server.Imagine a  as metadata to categorize content. Besides it’s possible to apply a label manually. A user chooses to hide or show a warning for posts with a specific label.This preference is stored on their data server.Here’s how Bluesky moderation works:The moderation service consumes the stream from the crawler.The moderation service analyzes the content and assigns a label to it.The index server stores the content along with its label.The user requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The data server includes label IDs in HTTP request headers before forwarding them.The index server applies the label setting in the response.Also a data server operator does basic moderation. The data server filters out the muted users before responding to the client.Put simply, a user can post about anything, but the content is moderated before being shown to the public.Bluesky allows a user to see how many people they follow also follow a specific user: social proof.For example, when I visit Jay’s Bluesky profile, it shows how many people I follow also follow her.Let’s dive into the different approaches they used to build this feature.Find the people I follow by querying the database.Do separate parallel queries for each user to find the people they follow.Check if any of them also follow Jay.But this approach won’t scale as the number of parallel queries increases with the number of people a user follows.A scalable approach is to convert it into a set intersection problem:Set 1 tracks the people I follow.Set 2 tracks the people who follow Jay.The intersection of these sets gives the expected result.An in-memory graph service prevents expensive database queries and performs intersections quickly. Yet Redis Sets don’t use different CPU cores at once. So here’s how they implemented a minimum viable product:Each user has a 32-character DID.The DID values are converted into uint64 to reduce memory usage.Each user’s DID maintains 2 sets: people they follow and people who follow them.But it still consumes a lot of memory and takes extra time to start.So they optimized the graph service by implementing it using Roaring Bitmaps.Yet let’s take a step back and learn Bitmaps to better understand Roaring Bitmaps.A  represents binary states using bit arrays.Imagine Bluesky has only 100 users.The index value of the people I follow is set to 1 on the Bitmap; the people I follow are then found by walking the Bitmap and recording the index of non-zero bits. A constant time lookup tells whether I follow a specific user. Although Bitmaps do faster bitwise operations, it’s inefficient for sparse data. A 100-bit long Bitmap is needed even if I follow only a single user; so, it won’t scale for Bluesky’s needs.It turns consecutive 0s and 1s into a number for reduced storage. For example, if I follow the last 10 users, only the last 10 indices are marked by 1. With Run-Length Encoding, it’s stored as 90 0s and 10 1s, thus low storage costs.But this approach won’t scale for randomly populated data, and a lookup walks the entire Bitset to find an index.Ready for the best technique? .Think of it as compressed Bitmaps, but 100 times faster. A Roaring Bitmap splits data into containers and each container uses a different storage mechanism.The dense data is stored in a container using Bitmap; it uses a fixed-size bit array.The data with a large contiguous range of integers are stored in a container using run-length encoding; which reduces storage costs.The sparse data is stored in a container as integers in a sorted array; it reduces storage needs.Put simply, Roaring Bitmaps use different containers based on data sparsity.The set intersection is done in parallel and a container is converted into a different format for the set intersection. Also the graph data is stored and transferred over the network in Roaring Bitmap’s serialization format.Many instances of graph service are run for high availability and rolling updates.Bluesky supports short videos up to 90 seconds long.The video is streamed through HTTP Live Streaming (). Think of HLS as a group of text files; it’s a standard for adaptive bitrate video streaming.A client dynamically changes video quality based on network conditions.A video is encoded into different quality levels: 480p, 720p, 1080p, and so on.Each encoded video is split into small segments of 5 seconds long.The client checks the network conditions and requests video segments of the right quality.HLS uses Playlist files to manage encoded video segments. Imagine the  as a text file, and there are 2 types of Playlists:Master playlist: list of all video quality levels available.Media playlist: list of all video segments for a specific video quality.First, the client downloads the Master playlist to find available quality levels. Second, it selects a Media playlist based on network conditions. Third, it downloads the video segments in the sequence defined on the Media playlist.The videos and playlists are cached in CDN to reduce costs and handle bandwidth needs. The stream requests are routed to CDN via 302 HTTP redirects.The video views are tracked by counting requests to its Master playlist file.And the response for the Master playlist includes a Session ID; it’s included in future requests for Media playlists to track the user session.Besides the video seconds watched by a user are found by checking the last fetched video segment.A video subtitle is stored in text format and has a separate Media playlist file.The Master playlist includes a reference to subtitles; here’s how it works:The client finds the available subtitles by querying the Master playlist.The client downloads a specific subtitle's Media playlist based on the language selected by the user.The client then downloads the subtitle segments defined in the Media Playlist.Subscribe to get simplified system design case studies delivered to your inbox:Bluesky Quality AttributesA user’s data is cryptographically signed before saving it in the data server; it shows data authorship.The Merkle search tree is used to check the integrity of data, such as posts, transferred over the network.Think of the  as an efficient data structure to check data integrity. It doesn’t store original data; instead, it has only cryptographic hashes representing data.Besides the crawler keeps a copy of each user’s repository; it verifies the Merkle search tree signatures on data updates.The crawler generates a stream to update the index server.Yet the stream increases bandwidth and infrastructure costs. So the events are validated on the crawler and services, such as the feed generator, are connected to a trusted crawler. Besides Merkle search tree blocks are converted to JSON objects, which lack verifiability and signatures, to reduce stream size.Put simply, Merkle search tree verification overhead is avoided by consuming the stream from a trustable crawler.The crawler transfers the stream to the index server over websockets; zstd compresses websocket traffic for performance.A user, with a massive following, needs a data server with only tiny computing resources as the index server displays aggregated data.Every change to a user's profile is propagated via the index server; which, means eventual consistency.Yet a user viewing their profile right after an update should see the latest changes. So Bluesky offers read-after-write consistency for profile updates; here’s how:All client requests are routed via the data server to the index server.The response headers from the index server are compared against the data server. The response is updated to include missing records before returning it to the client.This read-after-write behavior applies only to a user viewing their profile; others see the changes eventually.A popular user's post notifies many users, which results in many requests to view the post at once.The results from the index server are cached to reduce the database load. Yet a popular user's post creates a thundering herd problem.A view request, the first one, from a follower reaches the cache server.The cache server queries the database for post content.Requests from others reach the database while the cache waits for the first response.It groups requests for the same data within a short period. Then forwards only a single request to the database; thus, preventing the thundering herd problem.The data server notifies the crawler about data changes in repositories over websockets.Yet network interruptions occur, so the crawler periodically checks repositories. It then compares the data against its local replica to find data changes.Also requests are rate-limited to keep the system operational.HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) is returned in response headers when the rate limit threshold is exceeded. Interactions between servers are also rate-limited to avoid abuse in the decentralized architecture. A new data server’s request limit capacity is increased over time, based on trust, to keep the crawler running smoothly.Besides a user is only allowed up to 1,666 requests an hour to reduce bot activity.Bluesky has more than 28 million users; it became an independent company in 2021.Although anybody can host a server on ATProto, most Bluesky services are now run by a single company.ATProto and Bluesky look like an interesting new approach to social networks.👋  -Do you want to level up at work and better understand technical discussions?My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than 37 minutes a month.This is the first deep dive article in this newsletter; it's a free preview.Yet future deep dives, starting this February, are available only to paid subscribers.And subscription fees will be way higher than the current fees.So pledge now to get access at a very low price."This newsletter gave me ideas on how to build scalable systems."

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

He will be succeeded by Nikki Santoro, who has served as the chief operating officer since 2021. TechCrunch reports: Santoro's appointment is significant, as she is the first woman to become the CEO and only the second person to hold the position. Needham founded IMDb in 1990 at the age of 23, steering the company into a powerhouse within the entertainment industry. After 35 years, he'll transition to a new role as executive chair.
 
According to Needham, Santoro's ascension is well deserved. [...] Santoro has been with the company since 2016, leading the company in expanding its database and improving its IMDbPro membership. She previously held leadership positions at Amazon, Microsoft, and The Weather Channel. "Nikki's strategic vision, deep understanding of our customers and products, and commitment to innovation have already delivered impressive business results during her tenure as COO," said Needham in a statement. "Her track record of driving growth and enhancing our products and services makes her the ideal person to guide IMDb into a new era."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How WW1 Inspired The Lord of The Rings</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/tolkien-in-the-trenches-how-ww1-shaped-lord-of-the-rings</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:30:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ross Ulbricht granted a full pardon</title><link>https://twitter.com/Free_Ross/status/1881851923005165704</link><author>Ozarkian</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:10:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Stargate Project: SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, MGX to build data centers</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41</link><author>tedsanders</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:29:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After Hitler: The Cleanup That Followed WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTRLhs9tI70</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary tells the story of the clean-up that followed WW2.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.Alongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller "DeepSeek-R1-Distill" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters. These distilled models are based on existing open source architectures like Qwen and Llama, trained using data generated from the full R1 model. The smallest version can run on a laptop, while the full model requires far more substantial computing resources.The releases immediately caught the attention of the AI community because most existing open-weights models—which can often be run and fine-tuned on local hardware—have lagged behind proprietary models like OpenAI's o1 in so-called reasoning benchmarks. Having these capabilities available in an MIT-licensed model that anyone can study, modify, or use commercially potentially marks a shift in what's possible with publicly available AI models.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump’s Road from Jan. 6 Back to the White House | Trump&apos;s Comeback | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS7UMDHz3Qc</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 18:28:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a second Trump presidency seemed out of the question to many.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Chuck Nice sit down with science writer Dava Sobel, author of a new book on Skłodowska-Curie, to explore the enduring impact of her work on radioactivity.

Discover how Skłodowska-Curie’s meticulous research led to the isolation of radium and polonium—elements that unlocked the mysteries of radioactivity and laid the foundation for modern physics and chemistry. Learn how her insights paved the way for radioactive dating, which determined the Earth’s age, and her revolutionary contributions to medical science, including the use of radium to treat cancer and the development of mobile X-ray units during World War I.

We dive into the science behind her two Nobel Prizes—one in physics and one in chemistry—and her perseverance in refining tiny quantities of radioactive material from tons of ore. We also discuss the risks she and her collaborators faced as the dangers of radiation exposure became clear, as well as the scientific advances inspired by her work, including the creation of artificial radioelements for medical applications.

From her early experiments to her lab notes—still radioactive today—Skłodowska-Curie’s story is one of unrelenting curiosity and dedication. Join us for a deep dive into the science that defined her career and the discoveries that continue to shape our understanding of the universe.

Elaine is from Brazil, Yassin is from Tunisia. Camera teams accompany the two for nine months in their new working environments.

Germany’s labor market desperately needs skilled workers - particularly in the medical sector. There’s also a high demand for professional drivers. That’s why many companies are recruiting internationally.

Elaine from Brazil worked as head of nursing at the emergency department and intensive care unit of a clinic in São Paulo. She’s married and has an eight-year-old son. She’s long dreamed of living in Europe; São Paulo’s high crime rate is one of the reasons why she’s keen to leave her homeland. "I can’t travel alone to early or late shifts. I’ll either be raped or robbed," she says. In Germany, she’s hoping for security and a better quality of life - something she’d like for her son in particular. Elaine initially goes to Düsseldorf alone; the family plans to join her later. But it won’t be easy for the Brazilian woman. Despite the language barrier, bureaucracy, and the loneliness that comes with being separated from her loved ones, can Elaine start to feel at home in Germany?
Yassin originates from Sousse, a Tunisian coastal city. After leaving fininshing his schooling, he worked there as a truck driver. In Tunisia, the only requirements for this job are a driving license and initial training. Things are different in Germany: Yassin is training as a professional driver for three-and-a-half years at a haulage company in Hesse. Tunisian driver’s licenses aren’t recognized in European countries, so he needs to pass the tests again. Yassin’s trainers describe him as ‘highly motivated and very good’. His final exam is coming up soon. Will the young man, who’s also learning German, make it as a skilled worker on the German labor market? If so, he’d like a small flat where he can invite friends round. His current room, which doesn’t have a kitchen, isn’t suitable - and hospitality is very important in his home country.

--

In 1968, the American Heart Association made an announcement that would influence people’s diets for decades: they recommended that people avoid eating more than three eggs a week. Their reasoning was that the cholesterol packed into egg yolks could increase cardiovascular disease risk. So, what exactly is cholesterol? And is it actually bad for you? Hei Man Chan digs into this complex molecule.

DESCRIPTION
Julian Wood and Tom Johnson explore the complexities of modern software development, with Tom sharing his journey from machine learning and distributed systems to founding Multiplayer, a company focused on simplifying development by automating documentation, debugging, and system design.

They discuss the challenges of building and managing complex software architectures, especially with microservices and cloud platforms, and the need for better tooling to address these issues. Tom emphasizes the importance of simplicity, collaboration, and transparency in development, especially when it comes to API design and managing system dependencies. They also explore best practices for team communication, the evolving role of platform engineering, and the shift toward a future where infrastructure is abstracted away, allowing developers to focus on software creation.

Together, they envision a world where better tools and AI lower the barrier to entry for developers, driving innovation and enabling more people to bring their ideas to life. [...]

  "latitude": 40.6892,
  "longitude": -74.0445
}If the API can’t find the location, it provides an error response explaining why.{
  "error": "Invalid address format",
  "code": 400
}The apps you use every day—whether it's Gmail, Instagram, Uber, or Spotify—are essentially a collection of APIs with a polished user interface (UI) on top.Most applications follow the frontend/backend architecture, where:The  consists of APIs that handle data processing, business logic, and communication with databases.The  is a graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with these APIs, making applications user-friendly and accessible without requiring users to write code.Let’s break this down with a real-world example: .Before the Uber app existed as a sleek, user-friendly experience, the company first built the core APIs that power ride-hailing services:Calculating Fares & RoutesMatching Riders & DriversThese APIs run on Uber’s servers, forming the . Every time you request a ride, track your driver, or make a payment, these backend APIs handle the request. are responsible for optimizing these APIs, improving ride-matching algorithms, securing transactions, and ensuring a smooth experience for millions of users.The backend APIs handle , but they —which isn't practical for everyday users. That’s why companies build a frontend (user interface) on top of these APIs, allowing users to interact with the system .When you enter your pickup & destination address, the frontend sends an API request to  and displays available cars.Once the trip is complete, the frontend may call the process payment API to display the receipt.APIs come in different forms depending on , , and .1. Open APIs (Public APIs)Open APIs, also known as , are accessible to external developers with minimal restrictions.Companies provide these APIs to encourage  to integrate their services and build new applications on top of them.Example: YouTube Data APINormally, when you use the , it makes  to fetch your video feed, search for content, or post comments. However, YouTube also provides a  that allows developers to access some of this functionality .For example, the  allows developers to fetch video results based on a keyword. If you send a request to the API with "machine learning tutorial" as the search term, it will return a structured response (JSON format) containing a list of relevant videos, including titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and video links.This is incredibly useful because it enables developers to build custom applications on top of YouTube.2. Internal APIs (Private APIs), also known as , are designed xclusively for internal use within an organization. Unlike Open APIs, these are not accessible to external developers and are used to facilitate seamless communication between different internal systems within a company.Let’s take  as an example. When you place an order, you might assume that a single system processes your request. In reality,  (order processing, inventory, payment, logistics etc..) work together behind the scenes to fulfill your order efficiently.Each of these APIs , but they communicate through well-defined protocols to ensure a smooth and efficient process.Internal APIs allow companies to break down their applications into smaller, manageable services, making it easier to scale. Developers can  across different projects, reducing  and speeding up development.The first two types of APIs we discussed—Open APIs and Internal APIs—are functional and serve  like fetching weather data or booking a ride.But there’s another category of APIs that developers use daily:  (also called  or ).These APIs don’t connect different applications; instead, they provide predefined functions within a programming language or framework to make development easier.Python’s built-in list APIWhen working with lists, Python provides a set of built-in functions (methods) to manipulate data.numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 4]
numbers.sort()  # API call to sort the list

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("orange")  # API call to add an element

fruits.pop()  # API call to remove the last elementInstead of writing sorting algorithms from scratch, developers can use  or  in Python.Code APIs are not just limited to built-in programming language functions. Take , an AI/ML library. It provides a  for training machine learning models without needing to implement complex mathematical operations from scratch.For example, creating a  using TensorFlow's API is as simple as:import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation="relu")])Programming APIs abstract away complexity so that developers can focus on building solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.APIs communicate using different protocols and architectures that define how requests are sent, how responses are formatted, and how data is exchanged between systems.1. REST (Representational State Transfer)REST is the most widely used API communication method today. It is lightweight, stateless, and scalable, making it perfect for web services and mobile applications. REST APIs follow a set of design principles and use  (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.REST APIs are based on , and each resource is accessed through a . The API follows the , meaning the client sends a request, and the server processes it and sends a response.Example: REST API for a BookstoreRetrieve a list of books (GET Request):GET https://api.bookstore.com/books[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" }
]2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)SOAP is an older API communication method that relies on XML-based messaging. Unlike REST, which is lightweight, SOAP is more structured and secure, making it ideal for banking, healthcare, and enterprise applications.SOAP messages are sent using  and require a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file, which defines the API's available functions and request structure.Example: SOAP API for a Banking Service Fetching account balance<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:bank="http://bank.example.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <bank:GetAccountBalance>
         <bank:accountNumber>123456</bank:accountNumber>
      </bank:GetAccountBalance>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Body>
      <bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>
         <bank:balance>5000.00</bank:balance>
      </bank:GetAccountBalanceResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>GraphQL is an alternative to REST that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it more efficient for modern applications. Unlike REST, which requires multiple API calls to fetch related data, GraphQL can fetch all necessary data in a single request.Instead of predefined endpoints, GraphQL exposes a , and the client sends queries to request specific fields.Example: Fetching a user's profile and their recent posts in a single request.{
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      likes
    }
  }
}{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "posts": [
        { "title": "Hello World", "likes": 100 },
        { "title": "GraphQL is Amazing!", "likes": 200 }
      ]
    }
  }
}gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance API communication method that uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) instead of JSON or XML, making it faster and more efficient.gRPC uses  instead of text-based formats, reducing payload size and it supports , meaning the client and server can send data at the same time.Using an API might seem complex at first, but it follows a simple  pattern.Here’s a guide on how to find, access, and interact with an API step by step:Step 1: Find an API to UseBefore using an API, you need to  for your needs. APIs are available for different services like weather data, finance, social media, etc.Official API Documentation:Step 2: Read the API DocumentationAPI documentation explains how to use the API, available endpoints, authentication, and response formats.The OpenWeatherMap API allows users to fetch real-time weather data. Here's a breakdown of its key components:https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=city_name&appid=YOUR_API_KEY: City name (e.g., ): API Key (required for access)Step 3: Get API Access (API Key / Authentication)Most APIs  to prevent unauthorized access and manage usage limits.Common Authentication Methods:A unique key provided by the API serviceSecure login via Google, Github, etc.Token-based authenticationUsername + password (Base64 encoded)Example: Getting an API Key (OpenWeather API)Sign up at https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.Go to the  section and generate a key.Use the API key in requests:GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEYStep 4: Test the API Using Postman or cURLBefore writing code,  to see how it responds.Option 1: Using Postman (Recommended for Beginners)Click , enter the API endpoint URL (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY).Select  as the HTTP method.Click  and view the response in .Option 2: Using cURL (For Command Line Users)You can also test APIs directly from the  using .curl -X GET "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New+York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"Step 5: Write Code to Call the APINow that you’ve tested the API, it’s time to integrate it into your application.Example: Calling an API in Pythonimport requests

url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/weather?q=New York&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Temperature: {data['main']['temp']}°C")
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code) – Sends an API request. – Converts response to JSON.if response.status_code == 200 – Checks if the request was successful.Step 6: Handle Errors & Rate LimitsAPIs don’t always return perfect responses. You should handle: (e.g., wrong city name). (e.g., expired API keys). (e.g., exceeding request limits).Example: Handling API Errors in Pythonif response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Weather: {data['weather'][0]['description']}")
elif response.status_code == 401:
    print("Error: Invalid API key")
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print("Error: City not found")
else:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {response.status_code}")Step 7: Use API Responses in Your ApplicationOnce you fetch data from an API, you can display it dynamically in a web or mobile app. You can build a weather dashboard using the OpenWeatherMap API.Fetch live weather data from the API.Parse and extract relevant details (temperature, humidity, condition).Display the weather report in a user-friendly format.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Magenta.nvim – AI coding plugin for Neovim focused on tool use</title><link>https://github.com/dlants/magenta.nvim</link><author>anonymid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2025 03:07:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been developing this on and off for a few weeks.

subprojects, and we will be covering SIG Architecture:
Enhancements.In this SIG Architecture spotlight we talked with Kirsten
Garrison, lead of the Enhancements subproject.The Enhancements subprojectFrederico (FSM): Hi Kirsten, very happy to have the opportunity to talk about the Enhancements
subproject. Let's start with some quick information about yourself and your role.: I’m a lead of the Enhancements subproject of SIG-Architecture and
currently work at Google. I first got involved by contributing to the service-catalog project with
the help of Carolyn Van Slyck. With time, I joined the Release
team,
eventually becoming the Enhancements Lead and a Release Lead shadow. While on the release team, I
worked on some ideas to make the process better for the SIGs and Enhancements team (the opt-in
process) based on my team’s experiences. Eventually, I started attending Subproject meetings and
contributing to the Subproject’s work.FSM: You mentioned the Enhancements subproject: how would you describe its main goals and areas of
intervention?FSM: The improvement of the KEP process was (and is) one in which SIG Architecture was heavily
involved. Could you explain the process to those that aren’t aware of it?: Every release, the SIGs let the
Release Team know which features they intend to work on to be put into the release. As mentioned
above, the prerequisite for these changes is a KEP - a standardized design document that all authors
must fill out and approve in the first weeks of the release cycle. Most features will move
through 3
phases:
alpha, beta and finally GA so approving a feature represents a significant commitment for the SIG.The KEP serves as the full source of truth of a feature. The KEP
template
has different requirements based on what stage a feature is in, but it generally requires a detailed
discussion of the design and the impact as well as providing artifacts of stability and
performance. The KEP takes quite a bit of iterative work between authors, SIG reviewers, api review
team and the Production Readiness Review team before it is approved. Each set of reviewers is
looking to make sure that the proposal meets their standards in order to have a stable and
performant Kubernetes release. Only after all approvals are secured, can an author go forth and
merge their feature in the Kubernetes code base.FSM: I see, quite a bit of additional structure was added. Looking back, what were the most
significant improvements of that approach?: In general, I think that the improvements with the most impact had to do with focusing on
the core intent of the KEP. KEPs exist not just to memorialize designs, but provide a structured way
to discuss and come to an agreement about different facets of the change. At the core of the KEP
process is communication and consideration.To that end, some of the significant changes revolve around a more detailed and accessible KEP
template. A significant amount of work was put in over time to get the
k/enhancements repo into its current form -- a
directory structure organized by SIG with the contours of the modern KEP template (with
Proposal/Motivation/Design Details subsections). We might take that basic structure for granted
today, but it really represents the work of many people trying to get the foundation of this process
in place over time.As Kubernetes matures, we’ve needed to think about more than just the end goal of getting a single
feature merged. We need to think about things like: stability, performance, setting and meeting user
expectations. And as we’ve thought about those things the template has grown more detailed. The
addition of the Production Readiness Review was major as well as the enhanced testing requirements
(varying at different stages of a KEP’s lifecycle).: We’re currently working on two things:Creating a Process KEP template. Sometimes people want to harness the KEP process for
significant changes that are more process oriented rather than feature oriented. We want to
support this because memorializing changes is important and giving people a better tool to do so
will only encourage more discussion and transparency. While our template changes aim to be as non-disruptive as possible, we
believe that it will be easier to track and communicate those changes to the community better with
a versioned KEP template and the policies that go alongside such versioning.Both features will take some time to get right and fully roll out (just like a KEP feature) but we
believe that they will both provide improvements that will benefit the community at large.FSM: You mentioned improvements: I remember when project boards for Enhancement tracking were
introduced in recent releases, to great effect and unanimous applause from release team members. Was
this a particular area of focus for the subproject?: The Subproject provided support to the Release Team’s Enhancement team in the migration away
from using the spreadsheet to a project board. The collection and tracking of enhancements has
always been a logistical challenge. During my time on the Release Team, I helped with the transition
to an opt-in system of enhancements, whereby the SIG leads "opt-in" KEPs for release tracking. This
helped to enhance communication between authors and SIGs before any significant work was undertaken
on a KEP and removed toil from the Enhancements team. This change used the existing tools to avoid
introducing too many changes at once to the community. Later, the Release Team approached the
Subproject with an idea of leveraging GitHub Project Boards to further improve the collection
process. This was to be a move away from the use of complicated spreadsheets to using repo-native
labels on k/enhancement issues and project boards.FSM: That surely adds an impact on simplifying the workflow...: Removing sources of friction and promoting clear communication is very important to the
Enhancements Subproject. At the same time, it’s important to give careful consideration to
decisions that impact the community as a whole. We want to make sure that changes are balanced to
give an upside and while not causing any regressions and pain in the rollout. We supported the
Release Team in ideation as well as through the actual migration to the project boards. It was a
great success and exciting to see the team make high impact changes that helped everyone involved in
the KEP process!FSM: For those reading that might be curious and interested in helping, how would you describe the
required skills for participating in the sub-project?: Familiarity with KEPs either via experience or taking time to look through the
kubernetes/enhancements repo is helpful. All are welcome to participate if interested - we can take
it from there.FSM: Excellent! Many thanks for your time and insight -- any final comments you would like to
share with our readers?: The Enhancements process is one of the most important parts of Kubernetes and requires
enormous amounts of coordination and collaboration of people and teams across the project to make it
successful. I’m thankful and inspired by everyone’s continued hard work and dedication to making the
project great. This is truly a wonderful community.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Make computing personal again (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/128</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Benj Edwards wants to put the “personal” back in “personal computer”, the answer.ai folks took Devin for a month-long spin, Asaf Zamir explains why senior engineers can remain ICs and still have a fulfilling career, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti rethinks documentation by putting user actions first & Tero Piirainen lays out his case for Nue, the standards first web framework.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Wanted to share the project I really wanted to have. TLDR; this app lets you create your own list of words and you get a Duolingo-like experience (kind of, still needs a lot of features) practicing those words in their context.My English is not the best but not the worst either. But I realized I can't boost it up after a certain level! In my belief, in order to truly learn a language, you need to be exposed to that language often. Vocabulary is the key factor here if you really want to improve in any language.My experience is that when I read a book to improve my English vocabulary, I encounter words that I don't know so often and my reading gets disturbed. I go look for the meaning, come back, put it in context, re-read it, etc. It didn't work for me. So I tried listening to audiobooks - I listen to the book and read along, and whenever I encounter a word, I write it down. I get these 50 words in 2-3 pages and I ask ChatGPT to give me their meanings. I read them, take the book, and now read it myself. That helps for sure, but still after a while I lose those words because I never encounter them again. Well then, in order to not forget those words, I need some kind of exercise, right? A flashcard app maybe? Well, I still need to go out there, ask ChatGPT to create questions, put them in a flashcard app, etc. It's still time-consuming and this is supposed to be fun!I need to be exposed to English in my daily life. I just need to save the words somewhere and whenever I want, I need to be able to practice them in a fun way, in Duolingo style maybe? So then I realized would it be better to store words in their own context? I mean, say I read Harry Potter and have a list of words I encountered in it, say I watch Breaking Bad and have a list of words I encountered watching it. I believe seeing those words together and practicing together makes it easier to remember them.But I shouldn't be the one adding the meaning of the word and the one to generate exercises, right? It all should be automated. The exercise part will be handled by LLM for sure, but for the meaning of the word, I can fetch from a dictionary? But I really don't like the dictionary definitions and one word can have multiple meanings in their own context. So then I need to use LLM for this task too and have the word's meaning in its own context.You create a list for your context, you add words, meanings get added automatically, and I see the word added in a different color (coloring is also a method used to remember words). It all takes seconds. And whenever I want to practice these lists, I can use learn mode to learn and test my knowledge in quiz mode. So I basically built this app ((thanks to Claude 3.5 Sonnet)). I want it to be like Duolingo, but of course I still have a way ahead to go, but wanted to share it in hopes of getting contributors.You can read more in the repository. I would love to get your thoughts on this.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Alvin Plantinga - If God Knows the Future, What is Free Will?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vuHn1q22Ko</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Subscribe to the Closer To Truth podcast on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.

I’m worried that people who used to support, or at least tolerate me, will turn against me out of a desire to conform, to show their obeisance, to the current prevailing winds. I found myself writing this essay to explain why I’ve been feeling so miserable. I sent it to Paul before I published it here.It was the summer of 2015, and we were attending Y Combinator, the premier finishing school for startup founders. It was a long and stressful summer, holed up in our apartment in Mountain View, and a great experience.We benefitted immensely from our time there.At Y Combinator, there was sort of a curriculum, but they didn’t teach you anything per se. You’re assigned mentors, who you meet weekly, and you are free to book office hours – thirty minutes at a time – with a rotating cast of partners, each and every one of them formidable people, near or at the top of the field.The mentors applied a neat and very effective trick: they believed in you.Out of thousands of applicants, you had been chosen, plucked from obscurity, and flown out, and now you were here, in the centre of the (software) universe. They had invested in you, you personally, above and beyond your specific idea for a business.Now every week you spoke with them, and presented your metrics, and discussed your problems, and, well, you could be doing better, couldn’t you? These results, they were kind of mid.They didn’t boss us around, or tell us what to do, but we didn’t want to disappoint teacher. Their approval meant a lot. Doors would open. Success was at our fingertips: the summer culminated in Demo Day, a cattle call where we would be presented to investors, and our future might change forever.We worked harder. We learned how to hustle. We swallowed rejection. We doubled our efforts, bent over our desks, working until we could barely see straight, trying to figure out how to make something people want.One day, we booked a meeting with pg (Paul Graham). He had just retired from the day to day running of the show, handed the reigns over to sama (Sam Altman), and now roamed the halls as an elder statesmen, a congenial and affable uncle, dispensing advice.We were excited. I don’t think he was ever a  of mine, but he certainly had influence, made a big impression on me. I had read his essays eight or nine years earlier, during my undergraduate, hunched over a screen in my university’s computer lab, nodding along. I spent way too much time on hackernews. Lisp was cool, I was special for just taking an interest in startups and software, we could do anything if we worked hard enough.We explained our pitch to him: Appcanary monitors your apps and servers, and lets you know when you’re affected by a security vulnerability.He thought it was a decent enough idea, but the name, Appcanary, he wasn’t crazy about the name. He was very good at naming companies. He thought about it and told us that, really, we ought to be named Oracle, that would be a great name for us. Descriptive, simple, memorable.Shame it was taken, though.We nodded and thanked him, and laughed about it later. No one bats a thousand.YC had a huge positive impact on my life.People took us more seriously now. Before we were randos, misfits even, but now we were Princes of the Universe. We had rubbed shoulders with royalty, or at least sovereigns.Someone had believed in us, and pushed us until we understood how to make our own luck.We grew a lot that summer, but we didn’t raise that much money. A bit, enough to keep us going. I loved California, I liked San Francisco, but I didn’t feel comfortable trying to live there. I felt gross being part of a monied class in a city rapidly hollowing out. I’d had a precarious childhood and early adulthood, and I craved some kind of stability.Back home, we lived in the Best Neighbourhood in the Last Affordable Apartment In West Toronto. We knew it would reduce our chances for success, but it would double our runway. In the winter, I had started dating this most amazing girl, and I wanted to see where it would go.Two years later, we realized that everyone thought our product was useful but not  useful. We could get people to pay us hundreds of dollars per month, but not thousands. That’s the death knell of a vc-backed b2b saas sales model. High-touch sales to large companies is not worth it unless you can score thousands of dollars per month. We were too burnt out to pivot to another business idea, and we quietly folded.It was good timing: almost immediately after, GitHub announced they were going to provide our startup’s features . We gave them a call, we got them excited. They “acquihired” us as subject matter experts, and paid us a small fee for the intellectual property. We returned something like 40 or 45 cents on the dollar to our investors. Not a great result, but about par for the course. Most startups fail. Some of our Summer 2015 cohort flamed out faster, or more spectacularly.One of our investors commended us for our ethical behaviour – not everyone returns the money.It’s been almost ten years. After we got hired, Microsoft bought GitHub. I’m still with that amazing girl. We have two kids, a house.It turns out that I like women so much I’d like to be one of them. Or as close as I can get. I’m happier now, more joyful. I feel in touch with my body, and how I move through the world, in ways I didn’t before. Up until very recently, very few people would confuse me for a woman. It took me a while to remove my facial hair, I still haven’t trained my voice. That’s OK. What is a woman, exactly? I don’t know.I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. For that reason, I like to say that I am “non-binary trans femme”. It’s a mouthful, I know. But asking to be called “they” feels less burdensome, less of a polite fiction, than to ask to be called “she”.I just want to be treated with respect, and kindness. I don’t think I’m asking for much.Why is it wrong for me to have more joy in my life? I’m not hurting anyone.A few days ago, Paul Graham published an essay on “Wokeness”.I skimmed it. I couldn’t finish reading it, it made me too upset. It came a few days after Mark Zuckerberg announced he was going to increase the hate speech people like me receive. It’s not OK to imply someone has a mental disability – unless it’s because they’re queer. He also quietly removed some trivial accomodations he had made for his transgender employees. stung. That felt personal, targeted.I’ve been feeling quite anxious ever since. It feels like the world is crumbling around me.I’m still not sure what pg thinks “Wokeness” means. I know for a fact, that for most people – including many of the people he hangs out with – it just means “left-wing thing I dislike”. I got the impression that he thinks it’s bad, and that companies should purge people who are too woke. Maybe I’m being unfair to him.The irony is I too dislike nagging, hollow, corporate DEI exercises. In the abstract I was glad they existed but the insincerity was palpable. Are “identity politics” just a status game that economically advantaged elites play? I could be convinced.In the 2021 novel “Detransition Baby” the author shares a joke. Transgender women only have one of three jobs: computer programmer, aesthetician, prostitute.It’s an old joke. More of an observation, really. The director of “Vestidas de Azul”, a 1983 documentary about trans women in Madrid, had hoped to make a movie about trans women who were lawyers or held important roles in society. Instead he discovered that most trans women were  to be artists, hair dressers, or sex workers – so that’s who he made his movie about.I’m glad I can be a computer programmer; no one gets to be an artist anymore.If you haven’t met many trans women, that might sound over-the-top, hyperbolic. But for so long, people like me were strongly discriminated against. Until very recently, we were treated as bywords for freaks, or psycopaths.In this vein, the other day I saw a scorching, sizzling hot take on Mastodon that read something like: the reason why conservative women are so mad about trans women is because they don’t want to share washrooms with the sex slave caste.The reason why pg’s essay made me so upset, made me feel so dispirited, is because I benefitted directly from his largesse, from a system he set up. His “school” took a chance on me, taught me how to hustle, how to become a Princess of the Universe.I’m immensely glad for the opportunity. Would I receive it again today?In many people’s imagination, the word “woke” invokes someone exactly like me. I’m the person who is annoying about their pronouns. I’m the person who feels more comfortable using gender neutral bathrooms. I have a passing interest in social justice.I’m concerned he, or rather, the people who succeeded him, would take one look at me, and decide that I am “too woke”, whatever that means. I worry that my existence, that my living in joy, in a state of grace, is “too woke” to be worth employing. I’m certain he wouldn’t be rude to my face, but he might quietly discriminate against me, say no thanks. He might not even think of it as discrimination, only that I don’t have what it takes. Whatever that means.I think this is why the current turn in the industry is so unsettling.It’s mean, and unkind. It’s malicious. Moves like Mark’s, and essays like pg’s, create the permission structure for people to discriminate against me. I’ve already been pushed out of Twitter; the hate speech and censorship was too much to deal with. A lot of people feel that treating someone like me with respect is just a trendy moral fashion.Will my next promotion be silently denied? Will a coworker try to disrespect me out of spite? Will I be shut out of big tech? Will anyone invest in my next startup?I’m better at my job than most. I’d be a better startup founder today than I was in 2015. None of that will matter.It feels as if people like pg, or at least people he hangs out with, who once upon a time believed in me, who lifted me up, recognized my talent, would now prefer that I be relegated to the sex slave caste.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.13 Released</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/01/20/0555227/linux-613-released?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Nothing horrible or unexpected happened last week," Linux Torvalds posted tonight on the Linux kernel mailing list, "so I've tagged and pushed out the final 6.13 release." 

Phoronix says the release has "plenty of fine features":
Linux 6.13 comes with the introduction of the AMD 3D V-Cache Optimizer driver for benefiting multi-CCD Ryzen X3D processors. The new AMD EPYC 9005 "Turin" server processors will now default to AMD P-State rather than ACPI CPUFreq for better power efficiency.... 
Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more.
 
Phoronix notes that Linux 6.13 also brings "the start of Intel Xe3 graphics bring-up, support for many older (pre-M1) Apple devices like numerous iPads and iPhones, NVMe 2.1 specification support, and AutoFDO and Propeller optimization support when compiling the Linux kernel with the LLVM Clang compiler." 

And some lucky Linux kernel developers will also be getting a guitar pedal soldered by Linus Torvalds himself, thanks to a generous offer he announced a week ago:

For _me_ a traditional holiday activity tends to be a LEGO build or two, since that's often part of the presents... But in addition to the LEGO builds, this year I also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds ("LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron"). Not because I play guitar, but because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing"... 
[S]ince I don't actually have any _use_ for the resulting pedals (I've already foisted off a few only unsuspecting victims^Hfriends), I decided that I'm going to see if some hapless kernel developer would want one.... as an admittedly pretty weak excuse to keep buying and building kits... 

"It may be worth noting that while I've had good success so far, I'm a software person with a soldering iron. You have been warned... [Y]ou should set your expectations along the lines of 'quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Charlemagne</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/charlemagne</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the LA Wildfires Started ️‍🔥</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v328qNRMYcc</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 23:56:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Yet post-graduation, their trajectory is an economic tragedy - and a hidden arbitrage opportunity.Top London hardware engineer graduates: £30,000-£50,000Silicon Valley equivalent: $150,000+The reality for most graduates is even grimmer:£25,000 starting salaries at traditional engineering firmsExodus to consulting or finance just because it's compensated betterMeanwhile computer science graduates land lucrative jobs in big tech or quant trading, often starting at £100,000+Examples of wasted potential:Sarah: Built a fusion reactor at 16. Now? Debugging fintech payment systems.James: 3D-printed prosthetic limbs for A-levels. Today? Writing credit risk reports.Alex: Developed AI drone swarms for disaster relief at 18. Graduated with top honours from Imperial. His job? Tweaking a single button's ergonomics on home appliances.These aren't outliers. They're a generation of engineering prodigies whose talents are being squandered.This isn't just wage disparity. It's misallocation of human capital on a national scale.As a hardware founder in London, I've witnessed this firsthand. We have the talent for groundbreaking innovation, but lack the means to realise it.: Unlike lucrative software jobs, hardware engineering demands physical presence.European VCs, mostly bullish on fintech and SaaS, remain wary of hardware. Result? A feedback loop of underinvestment and missed opportunities. Traditional engineering firms fail to innovate in talent strategies and match compensation, accelerating brain drain. We're not just losing salary differences; we're missing out on the next ARM or Tesla. One successful hardware company can spawn dozens of ancillary businesses. We're losing these compounding effects.National Security Implications: In an era where technological edge equals geopolitical power, can we afford to let our best hardware talent languish?Brain Drain Acceleration: We risk losing our top talent permanently to overseas markets."London's lower living costs justify lower salaries."False. London is around the same as NYC and more expensive than most parts of California and definitely Texas. This also ignores:Wealth Creation and Ecosystem Acceleration: High salaries and successful exits compound dramatically over time, that's why the US has so much more VC and angel capital.Talent attraction: Top jobs draw global talent. Example: Google's entry into London with competitive salaries reshaped the entire tech ecosystem."UK's small market limits growth."Outdated thinking. Consider:Dyson: From a Wiltshire barn to a global technology powerhouse, now innovating in Singapore and Malaysia.Ocado: Online grocer turned global automation technology provider, with robotics solutions deployed across Europe and North America.ARM: Powering 95% of smartphones globally."Hardware is riskier than software."Development speed: 3D prints and PCB prototypes now available in 24 hours, rivalling software iteration speeds.Moat strength: Apple's hardware-software ecosystem is far more defensible than most pure software plays.ARM: Sold to SoftBank for $32B in 2016, now worth $140B+.CSR (Cambridge Silicon Radio): Acquired by Qualcomm for $2.5B in 2015.Dyson: While not an exit, it's valued at over £20B as of 2023.It isn't about costs. It's about ambition.While software talent flows freely globally, ambitious UK hardware startups can exclusively tap into a world-class, locally-bound talent pool.The Software Brain Drain:US tech giants easily poach UK software talentRemote work erases geographical boundariesResult: Constant outflow of top software engineersThe Hardware Opportunity:Physical presence matters - can't build rockets remotelyUK hardware talent largely untapped by global competitionBuild something ambitious, attract local engineering superstarsBrilliant minds wasting away in soul-crushing corporate jobsYour future "10x engineer" is someone else's bored employeeForget software. Hardware is the new frontier.Build the next ARM or Dyson, not another fintech appLeverage UK's world-class research institutionsIncumbents are unambitious, startups are few (for now)Top-tier VCs awakening to UK hardware potentialFirst movers will have pick of the talent poolThis arbitrage won't last forever. As you read this, others are waking up to the opportunity. The first movers will reap the rewards. The followers will wonder why they didn't see it sooner.The Hardware Revolution Starts NowWake up, UK. Our engineering talent is our nuclear fusion. Ignite it or lose the future.Your next unicorn isn't code. It's cobalt and circuits. Back the tangible.Stop fleeing to the US. London can be the hardware capital of the world. We have the talent. We have the creativity. What we need is your audacity.Your brain's worth billions. Build empires, not apps.While the world obsesses over the next GPT wrapper, we'll forge the next industrial revolution.This isn't a pipe dream.

Now, it feels like the most successful tech companies are making it worse.Internet surveillance, the algorithmic polarization of social media, predatory app stores, and extractive business models have eroded the freedoms the personal computer once promised, effectively ending the PC era for most tech consumers.The “personal computer” was once a radical idea—a computer an individual could own and control completely. The concept emerged in the early 1970s when microprocessors made it economical and practical for a person to own their very own computer, in contrast to the rise of data processing mainframes in the 1950s and 60s.At its core, the PC movement was about a kind of tech liberty—–which I’ll define as the freedom to explore new ideas, control your own creative works, and make mistakes without punishment.The personal computer era bloomed in the late 1970s and continued into the 1980s and 90s. But over the past decade in particular, the Internet and digital rights management (DRM) have been steadily pulling that control away from us and putting it into the hands of huge corporations. We need to take back control of our digital lives and make computing personal again.Don’t get me wrong: I’m not calling the tech industry evil. I’m a huge fan of technology. The industry is full of great people, and this is not a personal attack on anyone. I just think runaway market forces and a handful of poorly-crafted US laws like section 1201 of the DMCA have put all of us onto the wrong track (more on that below).To some extent, tech companies were always predatory. To some extent, all companies are predatory. It’s a matter of degrees. But I believe there’s a fundamental truth that we’ve charted a deeply unhealthy path ahead with consumer technology at the moment.Tech critic Ed Zitron calls this phenomenon “The Rot Economy,” where companies are more obsessed with continuous growth than with providing useful products. “Our economy isn’t one that produces things to be used, but things that increase usage,” Zitron wrote in another piece, bringing focus to ideas I’ve been mulling for the past half-decade.This post started as a 2022 Twitter thread, and I’ve offered to write editorials about my frustrations with increasingly predatory tech business practices since 2020 for my last two employers, but both declined to publish them. I understand why. These are uncomfortable truths to face. But if you love technology like I do, we have to accept what we’re doing wrong if we are going to make it better.While consumer and computer tech today is more powerful than ever before—and in some ways far more convenient—some of the structural ways we used to interface with technology companies were arguably healthier in the past.Further, what percentage of your income had to go towards annual software subscriptions on a 20th century Windows PC (like this Sony VAIO)? You bought an application and you owned an indefinite license to use it. If there was an upgrade, you bought that too. And if you liked an older version of the software, you could keep using it without having it vanish in an automatic update.How many Nintendo Entertainment System games sustained themselves with in-app purchases and microtransactions? What more did the console ask of you after you bought a cartridge? Maybe to buy another one later if it was fun?Which part of this Motorola StarTAC cellular phone kept track of your every move and sold the information, behind your back, to private data brokers? And which part included sealed-in batteries that would ruin the entire phone if they went bad?Which part of Google in the 1990s and early 2000s blanketed its results with deceptive ads or made you add “Reddit” to every search to get good results that weren’t overwhelmed by SEO-seeking filler content?Which part of this VHS tape disappeared or became unplayable if the publisher suddenly decided it didn’t like it anymore—or didn’t want to pay the writers and actors residual fees?Americans have allowed runaway business models, empowered by tech, to subvert privacy and individual liberty on the road to making money. Our default tech business model has become extractive, like part of a strip-mining operation. Consumers—and now creative works (used for training AI)—are treated as a natural resource to be milked and exploited.The extractive model may end up being self-destructive for the tech industry itself. In the physical world, resource extraction needs limits and regulations to be sustainable. It can be wildly profitable until a resource becomes over-harvested, or the harvesting process corrupts the environment that lets the industry exist in the first place.There’s also the drive to lock consumers into an ecosystem, powered by DRM. You should buy tech products and get direct value fairly, not unleash a secret vampire to track you, manipulate you, and attempt to extract money from you forever. Just because companies have unlocked this “everything as a service” endless money hack does not mean they should do it.And there’s another problem. Very soon, we might be threatening the continuity of history itself with technologies that pollute the historical record with AI-generated noise. It sounds dramatic, but that could eventually undermine the shared cultural bonds that hold cultural groups together.That’s important because history is what makes this type of criticism possible. History is how we know if we’re being abused because we can rely on written records of people who came before (even 15 minutes ago) and make comparisons. If technology takes history away from us, there may be no hope of recovery.How We Can Reclaim ControlEvery generation looks back and says, “Things used to be better,” whether they are accurate or not.But I’m not suggesting we live in the past. It is possible to learn from history and integrate the best of today’s technology with fair business practices that are more sustainable and healthy for everyone in the long run.In the short term, we can do things like support open projects like Linux, support non-predatory and open source software, and run apps and store data locally as much as possible. But some bigger structural changes are necessary if we really want to launch the era of Personal Computer 2.0.I’ve shown this editorial to friends, and some people felt that I did not emphasize the benefits of current technology enough. But I argue that my criticism is less about the actual technology and more about how we use it—and how companies make money from it.Since I originally wrote my thoughts in a viral Twitter thread in June 2022, others have expanded on these ideas with far more eloquence. Five months after my thread, Cory Doctorow wrote his first post on “enshittification,” a hallmark piece identifying a tendency for online platforms to decay over time.A common thread between many of the issues hinted at above and in both Doctorow and Zitron’s work has been the rise of the ubiquitous Internet, which has allowed content owners and device makers to keep an eye on (and influence) consumer habits remotely, pulling our strings like puppeteers and putting a drip feed on our wallets.Additionally, section 1201 of the DMCA made it illegal to circumvent DRM, allowing manufacturers to lock down platforms in a way that challenges the traditional concept of ownership, enables predatory app stores, and threatens our cultural history.Tech monopolies must be held to account, the outsized influence of some tech billionaires must be held in check, and competition must be allowed to thrive. We may also need to consider the protection of both consumers themselves and human-created works (including our history) as part of a conservation effort before extractive models permanently pollute our shared cultural resources.The way the political winds are blowing right now in the US, significant legal reform seems unlikely for now. Things may need to get much worse before they get better. But the kind of extractive lock-in we’re seeing with technology is fundamentally incompatible with freedom in my opinion, so something needs to change if we still value the kind of personal liberty the PC once promised—that freedom to explore, create, and make mistakes without surveillance or punishment.Sure, things will never be perfect in the United States. Profits will always be chased, and there will be collateral damage. And yes, some parts of technology today are better than ever (computing power, screen resolutions, and bandwidth to name a few).The Internet has brought amazing things, including Wikipedia, The Internet Archive, multiplayer online gaming, , and work-from-home jobs. But the urge to exploit users to the maximum extent through digital locks and surveillance should be held in check so that we can earnestly and honestly make the tech industry a beacon of optimism once more.The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1970s. There is no “logging off,” nearly everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, and the digital world increasingly overlaps with every aspect of our lives. That means digital freedom is now equivalent to actual legal and personal freedom, and we must be allowed to control our own destinies.Whether through purposeful reform or the eventual collapse of digital strip mining, I believe the personal computer will eventually rise again—–along with our chance to reclaim control of our digital lives.Feedback Update: 01/21/2025Since publishing this piece, last Friday, I’ve seen a lot of positive feedback for this piece, but also some frustration that I didn’t break down more specific personal, individual solutions to these problems.As most technically-included people know, we’ve already been enacting those personal solutions for decades. We may store our own data locally on NAS devices instead of the cloud, use open source software, try to preserve privacy with VPNs, etc., but it has not stopped the tide of abuse from the tech industry. And I think that mainstream tech consumers (for example: most of my family members and friends) have no inclination to ever do any of those things.That’s why I feel like the problem presented here is systemic and needs deep regulatory reform for things to actually get better in the United States. I think a good parallel may be climate change, where putting the onus on the individual to recycle or use fewer resources is misleading, when the biggest environmental abusers are large corporations and industries in aggregate. That needs deep systemic change too.Also, I think that technical people tend to immediately reach for technical solutions, but I don’t think this is a technical problem. Capitalism, when left lightly regulated, will do what it always does: Pursue the accumulation of capital at all costs, even while damaging society at large. But I am not anti-capitalist: It is a potent tiger with great potential benefits, but it needs to be kept properly in a cage, or it will devour all of us. We should not fall into binary positions. We need balanced regulation that maintains healthy profit-driven competition but keeps capitalism’s worst tendencies in check. Achieving that is admittedly very difficult in these highly polarized times.So I feel the issues here are ultimately systemic policy problems that need to be fixed with regulation (such as enact national right to repair laws, de-fang the DMCA, implement US national privacy protections, somehow limit the massive seemingly untouchable influence of big tech companies, and probably tax down tech billionaires).That’s a big ask that feels insurmountable at this moment, but it’s a movement can start now with people who are fed up with our current de facto abusive tech business models. I think eventually we will get there anyway, because the I am not sure the current extractive model is sustainable without encountering massive social unrest within the next decade. The alternative to change, if taken to an extreme, may be the collapse of personal liberty for everyone.In the meantime, while these lofty goals simmer and take shape, you can also continue to take personal steps to preserve your own tech liberty. Support nonprofits like the EFF that fight for privacy and user rights, strong encryption, open source, use local storage, and so on. I highly encourage it.Ultimately I hope these thoughts can be a starting point for others to pick up the torch and build off of. I will also be thinking of constructive solutions for a future follow-up.This is not the end of the conversation—it’s only the beginning.

And the trend is rising. The German harvest can‘t meet this demand and that’s why many berries are imported. From places where their cultivation is bad news for both people and for nature itself.

Southern Portugal is a booming region for berry production in Europe. The country’s cultivation zone has increased fivefold in recent years - to almost 5,000 hectares. One of the producers: Logofruits. The Portuguese company grows blueberries on its plantation in Odemira on 75 hectares of land. For the owner, Lourenço de Botton, the biggest challenge is finding enough workers for the harvest season. Blueberries have to be picked by hand, a labor-intensive process that requires Logofruits to employ around 600 workers per day. Many of those toiling in the orchards in the Alentejo region come from Nepal, India or Bangladesh.

Odemira’s mayor Hélder Guerreiro explains that almost 11,000 migrant workers from over 80 countries now live here. This corresponds to around 40 per cent of the municipality's population. Although on the one hand it’s a great opportunity for the region, which has struggled with emigration in the past, it also presents a huge social challenge. Another problem, according to Guerreiro, is intensive farming’s huge demand for water.

One thing’s for sure: a growing appetite for berries in Germany has consequences for the countries where they are grown. Blueberries and raspberries also grow in Germany, but not all year round. In summer, supermarkets should be full of regional fruit. But they’re not. Even during the domestic season, more and more produce from abroad can be found on the fresh produce shelves. What does this mean for German berry producers?

Erik Appel from Darmstadt grows raspberries, among other things. However, berries cultivated in Germany are completely different to those that have been shipped over long distances. These varieties have been bred to be particularly robust and long-lasting. When it comes to raspberries from the region for the local market, flavor is paramount. And in that respect, says Erik Appel, nothing beats local berries. In terms of labor costs however, it’s almost impossible to compete with imported goods. After all, Germany has one of the highest minimum wages in Europe. This is reflected in the price - imported goods are often cheaper than regional berries.

But now it can do it even better, explains Marco Ippolito of the Node.js steering committee:

In August 2024 Node.js introduced a new experimental feature, Type Stripping, aimed at addressing a longstanding challenge in the Node.js ecosystem: running TypeScript with no configuration. Enabled by default in Node.js v23.6.0, this feature is on its way to becoming stable. 


TypeScript has reached incredible levels of popularity and has been the most requested feature in all the latest Node.js surveys. Unlike other alternatives such as CoffeeScript or Flow, which never gained similar traction, TypeScript has become a cornerstone of modern development. While it has been supported in Node.js for some time through loaders, they relied heavily on configuration and user libraries. This reliance led to inconsistencies between different loaders, making them difficult to use interchangeably. The developer experience suffered due to these inconsistencies and the extra setup required... The goal is to make development faster and simpler, eliminating the overhead of configuration while maintaining the flexibility that developers expect... 

TypeScript is not just a language, it also relies on a toolchain to implement its features. The primary tool for this purpose is tsc, the TypeScript compiler CLI... Type checking is tightly coupled to the implementation of tsc, as there is no formal specification for how the language's type system should behave. This lack of a specification means that the behavior of tsc is effectively the definition of TypeScript's type system. tsc does not follow semantic versioning, so even minor updates can introduce changes to type checking that may break existing code. Transpilation, on the other hand, is a more stable process. It involves converting TypeScript code into JavaScript by removing types, transforming certain syntax constructs, and optionally "downleveling" the JavaScript to allow modern syntax to execute on older JavaScript engines. Unlike type checking, transpilation is less likely to change in breaking ways across versions of tsc. The likelihood of breaking changes is further reduced when we only consider the minimum transpilation needed to make the TypeScript code executable — and exclude downleveling of new JavaScript features not yet available in the JavaScript engine but available in TypeScript... 

Node.js, before enabling it by default, introduced --experimental-strip-types. This mode allows running TypeScript files by simply stripping inline types without performing type checking or any other code transformation. This minimal technique is known as Type Stripping. By excluding type checking and traditional transpilation, the more unstable aspects of TypeScript, Node.js reduces the risk of instability and mostly sidesteps the need to track minor TypeScript updates. Moreover, this solution does not require any configuration in order to execute code... Node.js eliminates the need for source maps by replacing the removed syntax with blank spaces, ensuring that the original locations of the code and structure remain intact. It is transparent — the code that runs is the code the author wrote, minus the types... 

"As this experimental feature evolves, the Node.js team will continue collaborating with the TypeScript team and the community to refine its behavior and reduce friction. You can check the roadmap for practical next steps..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John Dupré - Philosophy of Biological Ethics &amp; New Norms</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxoRQryScXE</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 16:00:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shop the Closer To Truth merch store with items like T-shirts, hoodies, mugs, notebooks, and more: https://bit.ly/3P2ogje

ABSTRACT
Programming #GenerativeArt, also known as #CreativeCoding, is often a trial-and-error process, combining creativity and logic to present something aesthetic. However, creative coding has a high barrier to entry due to the breadth of knowledge and coding skills required. This talk aims to lower that barrier for you to take home and practice creative coding.

In this talk, you will learn about #algorithms and techniques for generative art using a pure #FunctionalParadigm. First, shepherding random numbers to simulate the universality of nature patterns that appear in plants, rocks, sand, and smoke. Next, using L-system formal grammar to create a seemingly infinite, but well-structured, series of graphics. Lastly, interfacing with printers to bring your drawing to life.

For you to get the most out of this talk, you should be comfortable working in a functional language of your choice. Although I will introduce some theory, background in mathematics and formal theory is not required to attend.

However, the company began restoring service by midday Sunday.TikTok users began receiving a message about the ban around 10:30 p.m. ET on Saturday evening, and the app also disappeared from the Apple and Google Play app stores. As of Sunday morning, some users in the U.S. could still access TikTok via the web.“Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” the company’s message reads. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now.”The message also suggested this might only be a temporary disappearance. TikTok credited President-elect Donald Trump for indicating “he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office,” with users urged to “stay tuned!”The company warned earlier this week the app’s disappearance was imminent, saying Friday that it would “go dark” unless President Joe Biden’s administration made a “definitive statement” that it wouldn’t enforce the ban.The Supreme Court issued a ruling upholding the law Friday, and the Biden administration seemed inclined to leave the app’s fate in the hands of the next president. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that with the law taking effect right before Trump’s inauguration on Monday, “actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration.” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco issued a similar statement that “the next phase of this effort — implementing and ensuring compliance with the law after it goes into effect on January 19 — will be a process that plays out over time.”TikTok, however, suggested this was not enough assurance for “critical service providers” to continue listing or hosting the app in the United States unless the Biden administration made the aforementioned “definitive statement.” Jean-Pierre called TikTok’s response “a stunt” and claimed there’s “no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday.”As for the app’s long-term prospects, Trump has said he plans to “negotiate a resolution” that would presumably involve a sale or other concessions from ByteDance, which has repeatedly said it’s not interested in selling yet seems optimistic about its prospects under Trump. Trump reiterated to NBC News on Saturday that he will “most likely” give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban once he takes office Monday.“I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate. We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” Trump told the outlet.There was even a report suggesting that the Chinese government was considering a sale to Elon Musk as part of a broader deal with the Trump administration. A TikTok spokesperson called that report “pure fiction.”This post has been updated to reflect that TikTok is restoring service. It was previously updated to reflect Trump’s statements Sunday morning, as well as the additional apps that have been blocked by the law.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How The 20th Century Nearly Destroyed Europe&apos;s Monarchies</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqMpwTtDnLw</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2025 22:00:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In many ways the World Wars ushered in our modern world.

The Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed more than 12,000 structures and at least 24 people have died with more unaccounted for as multiple wildfires, fueled by severe drought conditions and strong winds, continue to burn. Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs estimate that the destruction will cost insurers as much as $30 billion dollars and after accounting for non-insured damages, the total costs will balloon to $40 billion. The ongoing fires, already appear to be the costliest wildfire event in California history.

By gradually occupying positions of power in politics, the judiciary and the media and steadily expanding its sphere of influence. Adherents have been bolstered by Trump’s 2024 election victory.

The tightening of abortion laws, the 2021 storming of the Capitol, a flare-up in racist violence: The US far-right has never been more powerful and visible than it is today - and that’s not just due to Donald Trump. The ultra-right has managed to gain a foothold at the very heart of US politics. As part of a strategy to win the 2024 election, it was ready to create a social divide similar to that of the secessionist wars, plunge the country into chaos and cause democracy to totter.
The triumph of the radical right is the outcome of a well-thought-out strategy set in motion more than 40 years ago by a conservative minority thirsty for power. And this group has pushed through its agenda under the nose of the world. Today, we can see how successful its strategy was: The ultra-right has gained control of the key centers of power, a process accelerated on all levels by Donald Trump. With his help, the ultra-right now has control of the Supreme Court. Its advance continues unabated, with Trump’s election victory marking an interim high point.

ABSTRACT
Functional programming is a useful technique. We spend a lot of time discussing it in the context of hard, challenging or interesting problems, but no where nearly enough in the context of mundane problems.

The UNIX shell, or command line interpreter. A simple, but useful program too often mistaken as complex, or mysterious. Almost every programmer is exposed to shells from a users perspective, but far fewer have ever implemented one, or even know where to start.

This talk aims to be a fun look at using functional programming in and around a traditional, some would say mundane, system utility. We will work through the concepts involved with implementing your own shell, and live code our way to a basic functional shell implemented in Haskell.

From this talk, attendees will walk a way with a better understanding of a program they use every day, as well as ideas and inspiration around using functional programming to solve mundane programming problems.

The findings appear in a pre-print paper titled "How is Google using AI for internal code migrations?" The Register reports: Their focus is on bespoke AI tools developed for specific product areas, such as Ads, Search, Workspace and YouTube, instead of generic AI tools that provide broadly applicable services like code completion, code review, and question answering. Google's code migrations involved: changing 32-bit IDs in the 500-plus-million-line codebase for Google Ads to 64-bit IDs; converting its old JUnit3 testing library to JUnit4; and replacing the Joda time library with Java's standard java.time package. The int32 to int64 migration, the Googlers explain, was not trivial as the IDs were often generically defined (int32_t in C++ or Integer in Java) and were not easily searchable. They existed in tens of thousands of code locations across thousands of files. Changes had to be tracked across multiple teams and changes to class interfaces had to be considered across multiple files. "The full effort, if done manually, was expected to require hundreds of software engineering years and complex crossteam coordination," the authors explain.
 
For their LLM-based workflow, Google's software engineers implemented the following process. An engineer from Ads would identify an ID in need of migration using a combination of code search, Kythe, and custom scripts. Then an LLM-based migration toolkit, triggered by someone knowledgeable in the art, was run to generate verified changes containing code that passed unit tests. Those changes would be manually checked by the same engineer and potentially corrected. Thereafter, the code changes would be sent to multiple reviewers who are responsible for the portion of the codebase affected by the changes. The result was that 80 percent of the code modifications in the change lists (CLs) were purely the product of AI; the remainder were either human-authored or human-edited AI suggestions.
 
"We discovered that in most cases, the human needed to revert at least some changes the model made that were either incorrect or not necessary," the authors observe. "Given the complexity and sensitive nature of the modified code, effort has to be spent in carefully rolling out each change to users." Based on this, Google undertook further work on LLM-driven verification to reduce the need for detailed review. Even with the need to double-check the LLM's work, the authors estimate that the time required to complete the migration was reduced by 50 percent. With LLM assistance, it took just three months to migrate 5,359 files and modify 149,000 lines of code to complete the JUnit3-JUnit4 transition. Approximately 87 percent of the code generated by AI ended up being committed with no changes. As for the Joda-Java time framework switch, the authors estimate a time saving of 89 percent compared to the projected manual change time, though no specifics were provided to support that assertion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Other people&apos;s robots (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/76</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jerod & Adam discuss Nvidia’s recently announced personal AI supercomputer, Waymo’s latest infinite loop, what’s involved in getting a “modern” terminal setup, and whether or not AI has gone mainstream… warts & all!Changelog++ members get a bonus 8 minutes at the end of this episode and zero ads.

This film shows how this commitment became a pillar of society. What measures are needed today to defend humanist values and preserve democratic achievements?

The film provides an insight into the challenges and hopes of remembrance culture work and examines how the motto ‘never again’ is evolving into an educational policy obligation in Germany.

With the end of the Second World War, two words became an integral part of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany: ‘Never again’. Never again fascism, never again war, never again a dictatorship like National Socialism, in which minorities are persecuted, disenfranchised and murdered. This endeavor gave rise to a culture of remembrance, which manifested itself in the form of education in schools, memorials and days of remembrance.

But sometimes, it seems like the more frequently these words appear in official speeches, the more they lose their clarity and meaning. The discourse on a meaningful culture of remembrance is mainly conducted in academia, and often doesn’t consider the realities of life in society at large.
 
The documentary is an incisive and confrontational look at practical remembrance work. It shows what measures need to be taken to protect democracy and human rights in Germany. It focuses on the everyday lives of those who put the culture of remembrance into practice, and those who benefit from it.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.

The app may still work for those who already have TikTok on their phones, although ByteDance has also threatened to shut the app down.In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, upholding the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Bidensigned in April."There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community," the Supreme Court's opinion said. "But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary."Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote concurrences.TikTok's fate in the U.S. now lies in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump,  who originally favored a TikTok ban during his first administration, but has since flip-flopped on the matter. In December, Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation and allow his administration "the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case."In a post on his social media app Truth Social, Trump wrote that the decision was expected "and everyone must respect it.""My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!" Trump wrote.Trump began to speak more favorably of TikTok after he met in February with billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass. Yass is a major ByteDance investor who also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social.In a video posted on TikTok, Chew thanked Trump "for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available" in the U.S. He said use of TikTok is a First Amendment right, adding that over 7 million American businesses use it to make money and find customers."Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come," he said.  The nation's highest court said in the opinion that while "data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age," the sheer size of TikTok and its "susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects" poses a national security concern.Under the terms of the law, third-party internet service providers such as  and  will be penalized for supporting a ByteDance-owned TikTok after the Jan. 19 deadline.If service providers and app store owners comply, consumers will be unable to install the necessary updates that make the app functional.Representatives of TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Users look for alternativesWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated Biden's support for the law in a statement, saying "TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law.""Given the sheer fact of timing, this Administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next Administration, which takes office on Monday," Pierre said.Attorney General Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco, his deputy, said in a release that the decision "enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security."Kate Ruane, the director of the Center for Democracy and Technology nonprofit, criticized the ruling, saying in a statement that it "harms the free expression of hundreds of millions of TikTok users in this country and around the world."In December, members of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent letters to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, urging the executives to begin preparing to comply with the law.Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, speaks to reporters outside the office of Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) at the Russell Senate Office Building on March 14, 2024 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesOn Jan. 10, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments from lawyers representing TikTok, content creators and the U.S. government. TikTok's lead lawyer, Noel Francisco, argued that the law violates the First Amendment rights of the app's 170 million American users. U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the app's alleged ties to the Chinese government pose a national security threat.  Many TikTok creators have been telling their fans to find them on competing social platforms such as Google's YouTube and  Facebook and Instagram, CNBC reported. Additionally, Instagram leaders scheduled meetings after the Jan. 10 Supreme Court hearing to direct workers to prepare for a wave of users if the court upholds the law.Chinese social media app and TikTok look-alike RedNote rose to the top of Apple's app store Monday, indicating that TikTok's millions of users were seeking alternatives.The Chinese government also weighed a contingency plan that would have X owner Elon Musk acquire TikTok's U.S. operations as part of several options intended to keep the app from its effective ban in the U.S., Bloomberg News reported Monday.Should ByteDance decide to sell TikTok to a U.S. company or group of investors, potential buyers may have to pay between $40 billion and $50 billion, according to an estimate by CFRA Research Senior Vice President Angelo Zino.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Story Behind Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s Gold Chain</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GMPJdoTriA</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 15:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg tells Emily Chang the story behind his latest gold chain.

Rome is the birthplace of Baroque, the highly ornate and elaborate style of architecture, art and design that flourished in Europe in the 17th and first half of the 18th century. Unlike the Renaissance, which was all about control and perfect balance, the Baroque era was famous for its dramatic flair and sense of movement. 

In this episode, Great Cities Explained goes outside the galleries and museums, and inside three Baroque churches that still house works by Caravaggio, Pozzo and Bernini  today…. and cost nothing to visit.

Since then, its politics have drifted rightward. Titans of industry and finance are migrating there, creating what’s being called Wall Street South. Now, as Donald Trump prepares for a second term, this nexus of "MAGA" and money could make Florida the policy blueprint for the rest of the nation.

Reporting done on this article: Hacker News, Ars Technica, Louis Rossmann. Also there's now a RSS feed if you want to be updated, I've reached to Canon myself.Companies squeezing every last penny out of their customers is no news. And Canonisnostranger.Last year, I've bought a Canon G5 X II camera which I wanted to use mainly for taking pictures at concerts. For me, it was the perfect match of focal range () and sensor size () for any compact camera I've compared. Because I'm only using this camera for a small range of events, it's just collecting dust in the meantime. So, why don't use it as a webcam with my Macbook?Admittedly, it did not cost me the $6300 from the article's title, much closer to $900. Nonetheless, everything I'm describing translates to every other Canon camera model!Problems Problems ProblemsI've tried this at first in 2024 with macOS 14, which did not work. I had similar experience with FUJIFILM's X Webcam software where either the camera will not get recognized by the software or the camera feed will freeze or simply be not available within other apps.As of January 2025 with macOS 15 Sequoia, these issues have been resolved for me.Well actually, only if you are able to download the software at all. Seems like their Microsoft IIS server is having some issues. The following error page will be presented to you, after they asked you for your full legal name and mail address - without which you can not download the software.So I've been really excited when I finally found a downloadable file on the Canon webpage which was not blocked by a faulty newsletter grift and saw the live feed of my camera!Well the excitement didn't last long since nearly every single setting is disabled if you're using the software without a paying Canon account.No brightness adjustments, no color correction, only 720p. Even in the paid version there doesn't seem to be a white balance adjustment setting.Canon will happily take your credit card for you to pay a small monthly price of $4.99 per month or even a discounted $49.99 per year!** The 30-day free trial is valued at $4.99 and can be cancelled at any time during the free trial period through your MyCanon Account Dashboard. After the free trial period, your subscription will automatically be rolled over into the annual or monthly non-refundable, auto-renewable subscription selected upon enrollment in the free trial, which can be cancelled at any time through your MyCanon Account Dashboard. The current available subscription plans are $49.99/year or $4.99/month.In a support document, Canon lists all differences between the free and paid version. So you can be very gladful, they allow you to even connect the camera.Software development isn’t free, and I’m happy to pay for software I use regularly. However, Canon is a hardware company, not a software company, and they should—due to the lack of standards—provide software that allows you to use their cameras as intended. Aside from development costs, there’s no justification for a subscription model, particularly from a company earning nearly $1.9 billion in profit*.So Canon will not allow you to use  camera on  computer with  cables the way you intent to without paying for another subscription.* In an earlier version of this article I wrote "$3 billion in profit"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Baby Caught in a For-Profit Healthcare Tragedy | Bloomberg Investigates</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgMNCj94oY</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 01:30:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In one of the poorest neighborhoods in Kampala, a group of midwives help vulnerable mothers give birth for free.

Most scientists believe that science can say nothing about God other than to show that there is no need for such a being. Scientists claim that science is quite capable of providing most explanations today and virtually all explanations in the future. Others say that the breathtaking visions of science are the perfect expressions of a Creator God.

	Director-writer David Lynch, who radicalized American film with with a dark, surrealistic artistic vision in films like “Blue Velvet” and “Mulholland Drive” and network television with “Twin Peaks,” has died. He was 78.
	Lynch revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with emphysema after a lifetime of smoking, and would likely not be able to leave his house to direct any longer. His family announced his death in a Facebook post, writing, “There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, ‘Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.'”
	The “Twin Peaks” TV show and films such as “Blue Velvet,” “Lost Highway” and “Mulholland Drive” melded elements of horror, film noir, the whodunit and classical European surrealism. Lynch wove tales, not unlike those of his Spanish predecessor Luis Bunuel, which proceeded with their own impenetrable logic.

	
	A four-time Oscar nominee, Lynch received an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2020.
	After years spent as a painter and a maker of short animated and live action films, Lynch burst onto the scene with his 1977 feature debut “Eraserhead,” a horrific, black-humored work that became a disturbing fixture on the midnight movie circuit. His outré and uncompromising style quickly won the attention of the Hollywood and international movie-making establishment.
	He was hired by Mel Brooks’ production company to write and direct “The Elephant Man,” a deeply affecting drama about a horrifically deformed sideshow freak in Victorian England who became a national celebrity. The feature captured eight Academy Award nominations, including Lynch’s first for best director.
	He found less success with his 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s sprawling science fiction novel “Dune.” The production, made on a budget of $40 million during an arduous three-year shoot, was a colossal box office flop.
	However, Lynch rebounded from the disaster with two films that defined his mature style: “Blue Velvet” (1986), a frightening hellride through the psychosexual underbelly of a small American town, and the sexed-up, violent road movie “Wild at Heart” (1990), which was honored with the Cannes Film Festival’s Palme d’Or.
	In 1990, he revolutionized American episodic TV with “Twin Peaks,” a series he created with writer Mark Frost. With action springing from the investigation of a high school girl’s mysterious murder in a Washington lumber mill town, the weekly ABC show plumbed disquieting, theretofore taboo subject matter and made the inexplicable a fixture of modern narrative television.

	
	A major hit in its first season, “Twin Peaks” lost its momentum and ultimately its audience in year two. However, it spawned a feature-length prequel, 1992’s over-the-top “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me”; 25 years later, the ongoing affection of a loyal cult of viewers sparked a limited-run third season for Showtime that picked up where the second season left off.
	Later in his career, in such features as “Lost Highway” (1997), “Mulholland Drive” (which won him the best director award at Cannes in 2001) and “Inland Empire” (2006), Lynch flexed a super-heated style that pivoted on plots emphasizing doubled personalities, unexplained transformations and shocking acts of violence. The quiet yet quirky “The Straight Story” (1999) harkened back to the more reserved emotional pull of “The Elephant Man.”
	The director himself was consistently reticent about sorting the meaning of his work for his viewers. In the book-length collection of interviews “Lynch On Lynch” (2005), he addressed the enigmatic core of his work with writer Chris Rodley.
	“Well,” Lynch said, “imagine if you did find a book of riddles, and you could start unraveling them, but they were really complicated. Mysteries would become apparent and thrill you. We all find this book of riddles and it’s just what’s going on. And you can figure them out. The problem is, you figure them out inside yourself, and even if you told somebody, they wouldn’t believe you or understand it in the same way you do.”
	In addition to his honorary Oscar, Lynch’s one-of-a-kind career was acknowledged by a special award (shared with his frequent star Laura Dern) at the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards and a Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Film Festival.
	He was born Jan. 20, 1946, in Missoula, Montana. His father was a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, and his peripatetic family lived in the plains states, the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast before settling in Alexandria, Virginia, where Lynch attended high school.
	An indifferent student, Lynch focused on painting. A one-year stay at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and an abortive trip to Europe with his friend Jack Fisk (later a noted Hollywood production designer) were succeeded by his enrollment at Philadelphia’s Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1965.

	
	Living in a forbidding Philly neighborhood with his first wife and infant daughter Jennifer (later a director herself), Lynch began to dabble in film, directing the animated shorts “Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)” and “The Alphabet” (1968).
	“The Grandmother” (1970), a combination of animation and live action, was filmed with money obtained from a grant by the newly founded American Film Institute. In 1971, Lynch moved to Los Angeles to study filmmaking at the AFI’s Conservatory for Advanced Film Studies, headquartered in the former Doheny mansion in Beverly Hills.
	Beginning in 1972, Lynch began work on a feature at the AFI. Inspired by his bleak years as a print engraver and struggling artist in Philadelphia, a 21-page initial script began to take shape; Lynch would later say he had no memory of writing it. Over the course of the next five years, he made the film with several collaborators who would remain constants in his career, including sound designer Alan Splet, cinematographer Frederick Elmes and actor Jack Nance.
	Shot laboriously, cheaply and on the fly for five years, “Eraserhead” was released by indie distributor Libra Films International in 1977. The disquieting black-and-white film followed the psychological descent of its maladroit hero Henry Spencer (Nance) after the birth of his monstrously malformed baby.
	Critics were decidedly alarmed by the picture when it premiered at L.A.’s Filmex in 1977, but it took on a commercial life of its own when Libra opened the picture at midnight screenings in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Lynch would frequently appear at L.A. screenings, admonishing his mystified audiences, “Don’t ask about the baby.”
	One enthusiastic viewer at a midnight show at L.A.’s Nuart Theatre was Stuart Cornfeld, a producer at Mel Brooks’ Brooksfilms. He urged Brooks to employ Lynch, and, after viewing “Eraserhead,” Brooks offered the director a job.
	For his project, Lynch took on the story of John Merrick, whose sensational life story had already inspired Bernard Pomerance’s hit 1977 play. The film version of “The Elephant Man” was an entirely new enterprise, co-written by Lynch and starring a heavily made-up John Hurt as the sensitive Merrick, Anthony Hopkins as the London Hospital surgeon who became his guardian, and Brooks’ wife Anne Bancroft as a sympathetic West End stage star.

	
	“The Elephant Man” had a powerful emotional impact, and became a box office and critical hit; Lynch received Oscar nods as best director and for best adapted screenplay, with the film also taking a nomination for best picture. The triumph led to a multiple-picture deal with Dino Di Laurentiis.
	The sprawling space opera “Dune,” about galactic family dynasties warring over possession of a space-travel “spice” mined on a desert planet, had already defeated projected adaptations by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott when Lynch took on the material.
	Filmed laboriously on Mexican soundstages with an enormous international cast, “Dune” sported an unusual Flash Gordon-meets-Antonio Gaudi production design, a memorable gallery of demented Lynchian villains and the director’s trademark amniotic visuals.
	The picture satisfied no one: Both audiences attuned to the boisterous heroics of “Star Wars” and impatient critics rejected Lynch’s contorted, confusing and harshly digested reading of Herbert’s novel, and the film tanked on arrival. Lynch later told Chris Rodley that at the conclusion of the ordeal, “I was almost dead. Almost dead!”
	However, Lynch’s second film for De Laurentiis defined the contours of his mature style. “Blue Velvet” starred Kyle McLachlan, who had played the messianic hero of “Dune,” as a small-town boy who is plunged into a whirlpool of sexual violence, murder and sadomasochism.
	Featuring a potent cast that included Isabella Rossellini (with whom Lynch became involved romantically), Laura Dern, Dean Stockwell and, most notably, Dennis Hopper as its deranged, out-of-control villain, “Blue Velvet” polarized critics, but it cemented Lynch’s reputation as a fearless and daring film author. The film was the start of his collaboration with composer Angelo Badalamenti.
	Four years later, the Lynch style was brought to the small screen with “Twin Peaks.” Starring McLachlan as eccentric FBI agent Dale Cooper, the series used the investigation of the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer as a springboard into a swirling narrative vortex involving sexual intrigue, drug addiction, prostitution, madness and demonic possession. TV audiences tuned in to track the mystery and remained for the series’ complexly interwoven characters and perverse, at times supernatural plot twists.

	
	The show’s first season scored 14 Emmy nominations, including nods for Lynch for writing and directing the pilot, but declining ratings after the drawn-out revelation of Palmer’s killer and Lynch’s diminishing participation due to production of a new feature led to a cliffhanging wrap-up at the end of season two.
	However, the “Twin Peaks” saga had legs. Actress Sheryl Lee was brought back from the dead to play Laura Palmer in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” which tracked the fateful last week of Palmer’s life in lurid, screaming detail. And Showtime cable audiences were baffled anew by 2017’s much-belated third season, which reunited McLachlan and several members of the original cast.
	The truest legacy of “Twin Peaks” may have been its impact on the development of unusual long-form episodic series. Successors ranging from “Wild Palms” to “True Detective” all bore Lynch’s distinctive stylistic fingerprints.
	Lynch’s first feature after “Twin Peaks,” 1990’s “Wild at Heart,” was an oddball exodus, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, in which an Elvis-fixated ex-con (Nicolas Cage) and his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Laura Dern) are pursued by the murderous minions of the girl’s jealous mother (Dern’s own mother Diane Ladd). Domestic reaction was mixed to the gory, sexually frank mix of “Detour” and “The Wizard of Oz,” but the Cannes jury was wowed.
	Lynch’s association with Gifford continued with “Lost Highway,” for which the two collaborated on an original screenplay. A doppelganger murder mystery that foreshadowed “Mulholland Drive,” the disquieting, brutally effective thriller starred Bill Pullman, Balthazar Getty and Patricia Arquette as the players in a homicidal foursome.
	After spending most of the decade on the far side of narrative coherence, Lynch came back down to earth with “The Straight Story,” the first feature in which he took no hand in writing. In the incongruously Disney-distributed picture, based on a true story, Richard Farnsworth starred as an Iowa man who drives from Iowa to Wisconsin on a power mower to visit his seriously ill brother.
	Though not a major hit, the film was critically well received, and proved to Lynch’s naysayers that he was capable of bringing life to material that was not extravagantly outrageous. Farnsworth received an Oscar nomination for his performance; the veteran actor and stunt man, who was suffering from terminal prostate cancer during the production of the film, died by suicide in 2000.

	
	An enlarged version of a prospective pilot for a new TV series became what may have been Lynch’s most widely acclaimed film, and a defining summation of the filmmaker’s themes and narrative obsessions.
	“Mulholland Drive” served a darkly satirical comment on the ways of Hollywood in the story of a young actress (Naomi Watts) whose relationship with an amnesiac stranger (Laura Elena Harring) becomes a hall-of-mirrors story of manipulation, betrayal and suicide. Lynch was nominated for a 2002 best director Oscar.
	Some of the same themes came to the fore in “Inland Empire,” Lynch’s first film to be shot entirely on digital video, with Laura Dern starring as an on-the-skids actress involved in typical Lynchian psychic disorder. Owing to its format, still a relative rarity theatrically in 2007, the three-hour feature was little seen after its 2007 premiere at the Venice Film Festival.
	In 2022, he appeared as John Ford in Steven Spielberg’s “The Fablemans,” and also provided the voice of the mad scientist in “Robot Chicken.”
	Beyond his work in film and TV, Lynch exhibited his paintings internationally and issued many solo and collaborative albums of music. He contributed a weekly comic strip, “The Angriest Dog in the World,” to the alternative weekly the Los Angeles Reader for eight years. His wry, deadpan weather reports were aired daily on the L.A. rock station Indie 103.1 for several years and continued on social media.
	A devotee of transcendental meditation from the 1970s on, he established his David Lynch Foundation to promote the Eastern practice, and enlisted such stars as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Donovan for fund-raising concerts.
	Despite persistent rumors of new feature and TV projects after “Twin Peaks” came to an end in 2017, Lynch focused on making music videos and composing music with collaborators including Christabell. He offered his name to the David Lynch Graduate School of Cinematic Arts at Maharishi University and a line of coffee beans and designed Silencio nightclubs in Paris and New York. 
	Lynch was married four times. He is survived by two daughters and two sons.
	The first reference to David Lynch in  came in the Dec. 6, 1968, edition of , in a story noting that he had received a $5,000 grant from the American Film Institute for his short film “The Grandmother.” ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rasputin&apos;s Curse: The Final Days of the Romanovs</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcS056KiJa0</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For three hundred years Russia was ruled by one family: the Romanovs.

But this film documents a bleak scenario -- in which microcredits have destroyed entire families. Over-indebtedness has driven some recipients to suicide.

Expectations were high. When Muhammad Yunus, the "banker to the poor” and founder of the Grameen Bank for microfinance in Bangladesh, received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2006, it was clear to many that the principle of helping people to help themselves would lift many out of poverty. 

From the 1980s to the early 2000s, microcredits were seen as one of the best tools for combating poverty. However, the loans, which were initially seen as a positive inflow of liquidity, quickly led to further financial obligations for many families. After all, interest had to be paid on these loans. Illegal lenders stepped in. The pressure on families became unbearable, leading to the sale of land, migration, the break-up of families and ultimately even suicide.

The film tells the stories of three Cambodian families. Along the way, it debunks the myth of microfinance as a tool that truly helps the poor. Told through the eyes of the protagonists and through their personal experiences, this film highlights the hardships faced by so many Cambodians because of debt.

These baths were more than places for hygiene — they were essential to Roman social life. Citizens would visit the baths after their morning business, using the time not only to clean but to socialize, network, and even conduct business. The grandeur of the baths is exemplified by their mosaics, shrines, and gyms, which catered to all aspects of Roman daily life.

--

Today, rats are often regarded as the most successful invasive species in the world. The most common species of rat scurried onto the scene roughly 1 to 3 million years ago in Asia. There, they craftily survived Earth’s most recent ice age, and eventually, began living around and with humans— though often at the mercy of human priorities. Max G. Levy traces the entangled history of human and rat.

The video shows journalists and innocent Iraqi civilians, including Sajad’s father as he stopped to help, being circled and then repeatedly shot at from the American helicopter.  

The classified footage, allegedly showing potential war crimes, was made public in 2010 by publisher Julian Assange, for which he was facing a 175-year prison sentence in the US.  

In June 2024, Assange pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information under a deal allowing him to walk free after a 14-year legal battle.

"We don't care about professional coders anymore," CEO Amjad Masad told Semafor, as the company refocuses on helping non-developers build software using AI. 

The strategic shift follows the September launch of Replit's "Agent" tool, which can create working applications from simple text commands. The tool, powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model, has driven a five-fold revenue increase in six months. The move marks a significant departure for Replit, which built its business providing online coding tools for software developers. The company is now betting that AI will make traditional programming skills less crucial, allowing non-technical users to create software through natural language instructions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>No Calls</title><link>https://keygen.sh/blog/no-calls/</link><author>ezekg</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 14:17:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first started Keygen, I had this idea in my head that I could create a
company where I never had to get on a sales call — or any call. Being an
introvert, I absolutely hated calls. They're not only awkward, but a 30 minute
call takes up hours of my headspace. I quickly learned that I didn't want to
do them, and so I decided that I wouldn't.I instituted a bonkers  policy at work.(Even I thought I was being crazy.)However, as Keygen grew, I wanted to start to move more up-market. I wanted
larger customers, because the bigger a customer got, the less support they
typically needed, and of course, the more they paid me. And the bigger
logos help gain trust in a market.The first thing I tried was taking sales calls. I threw up a big 
button on my enterprise pricing page — but I obviously hated it.(What about for non-enterprise leads? Well, I can't justify a call for $49/mo,
I'll tell you that much, especially when they may not buy.)I felt like I was wasting my time, the lead's time, and I could never close a
sale. It felt awkward. I tried for months. I never felt prepared. I felt like
I was constantly talking to the wrong people, slowly climbing the ladder to an
actual stakeholder, repeating myself over and over every call — and then
repeating myself  in a summary email."Couldn't this have all been an email?"(Yes, it could — and should — have been.)"This would be easier if it was async so I could think about my answer.""This person isn't somebody that has the authority to even close.""Is this person even involved in the project?""How do I talk to engineering?""Why am I talking to this person again?"One day, I woke up and out of frustration, I nuked the  button
from my pricing page.When the next person asked for a call, I responded with a simple "No, we don't
do calls, but happy to help via email. Feel free to CC any relevant team
members onto this thread."Their response was surprising. They  what I suggested — they CC'd
the engineering department onto the email, they asked their questions, and we
started chatting integration strategies.Instead of speaking with somebody who was multiple positions removed from the
project, I was speaking with the actual people who could champion Keygen within
the organization — the people who're directly involved — I thought to myself, "did I just bypass all of the red tape?"That month, I closed my first enterprise sale.Nearly everybody I sent that to  to skip the calls too. (I've even had
people literally say that to me in their response!)Sometimes, it didn't work out, and that's okay. I don't expect Keygen to be a
fit for everybody; and not everybody is a fit for Keygen.Am I leaving money on the table?But I personally don't  like I am. I feel like I get to wake up every
morning and do the kind of work that I love to do. And I feel like I have
the freedom to avoid the type of work that I hate to do.I think about it like this: I don't provide white-glove integration or
consulting services, even though I might be able to earn more money if
I did. (And lots of people ask for it!)But that's not what I want to do. That's not why I built Keygen.In the same way, I don't want to do calls.So, in enterprise sales, why do calls happen? Enterprises often default to
calls for these 4 totally-solvable reasons:They don't understand what you offer.They don't know how to use it.They don't know your price.If you want to try , you need to solve these problems.1. They don't understand what you offerThis comes down to messaging. If your messaging is vague, people will need to
get on a call to understand what you actually offer. If your product offering
is too wide (i.e. you do too much), people will feel like
they need to get on a call just to understand if your product is a good fit
for their much more narrow use-case.But if you narrow down your focus, and really nail your messaging — make it
clear what you actually do — you can eliminate the question entirely. Drop the
 taglines and actually sell the product. (And now, it
might be easier to see  some companies use these taglines — it's like
a sales call siren song!)2. They don't know how to use itIf your product isn't self-serve, and if your onboarding sucks, people will
feel like have they to book a call in order to get started.If you don't provide enough information on your website to scope a POC or an
integration, they're going to need to somehow obtain that information. And
that typically requires a call.e.g. if you don't have public documentation, you guessed it — call.(And why would you not have public documentation?)3. They don't know your pricePrice is the big one. Enterprises are used to the dance. You book a call, size
each other up, and then come up with a b.s. price. It's all so tiring. And if
you want to skip calls, you have to dip out of the dance.You can do this by putting enterprise pricing up front and center. I don't care
how large the number is — put it on your pricing page. If you feel like you're
giving up too much money, maybe  isn't for you.When somebody asks for a call to discuss pricing, all you have to do is say
something simple like, "Our enterprise pricing is available here. Let me
know if you have any questions."Last, but most certainly not least, is trust. If an enterprise doesn't trust
you, they will not buy from you —  How do you gain trust? Well, first
off, don't die. Trust is a function of time — i.e. the longer you
exist, the more people will trust that you'll continue to exist.But there are other facets of trust as well, and enterprises will send you huge
time-consuming questionnaires to alleviate all of their concerns. They might
even want to jump on a call. All they're trying to do is be compliant, and you
can help them be compliant without calls.You can do that by clearly articulating how your company handles data, how you
handle security, and how you handle incidents. I'm sure SOC2, HIPAA, and PCI
certifications would help, too, but we don't hold those yet (but our
infrastructure providers do).(At Keygen, we have a security page that outlines all of this, and
essentially answers the questions that are in most security questionnaires
we've seen.)It may be controversial (I'm almost sure of it), but here's my philosophy on
enterprise sales while avoiding sales calls entirely:No sales calls, except for a short  if absolutely needed.
Discovery calls are just a formality.Use email. Ask leads to CC relevant teammates (e.g. engineering).Explain your value clearly. Don't muddy the waters by doing too much. Avoid
vague messaging that prompts more questions.Focus on security, and spell it out in public docs.Document every problem to avoid repeating answers (i.e. allow them to easily
find the answers themselves).Use fixed- or transparent-pricing. (If you like calls, ignore this.)Make onboarding self-serve.I'm sure some people will scoff at some or all of this, but maybe others who are
like myself will read this and realize they don't have to do sales like everybody
else. Enterprise sales don't have to be crazy.If you want to go , maybe try out some of the things above.If you want to do calls, do the opposite of all of these things. some readers have (rightfully) pointed out that we do indeed have
  a  button on our enterprise pricing page, and so there seems to
  be a disconnect. I've been practicing a strict  philosophy for years
  and years and years, and the  button being back is relatively
  new.  I briefly touched on this in the conclusion, but this call is a short 15 min
  ,  a sales call. It's essentially a formality to intro
  each other, make sure we're human, and move onto email for any further
  discussion. There is no further call.  Essentially, over the years of strictly , I discovered that not all
  enterprises will shoot you a cold email to start the conversation, so this
  call is to capture those leads, with the end-goal of having all real
  discussion in email.  The point of  is to dip out of the dance, not of all communication.  tl;dr: some enterprises will bounce if they don't see a  button.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nepenthes is a tarpit to catch AI web crawlers</title><link>https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/</link><author>blendergeek</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:57:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a tarpit intended to catch web crawlers. Specifically, it's targetting crawlers that scrape data
for LLM's - but really, like the plants it is named after, it'll eat just about anything that finds it's
way inside.It works by generating an endless sequences of pages, each of which with dozens of links, that simply go
back into a the tarpit. Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way, causing them to appear
to be flat files that never change. Intentional delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your
server, in addition to wasting their time. Lastly, optional Markov-babble can be added to the pages, to
give the crawlers something to scrape up and train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse.THIS IS DELIBERATELY MALICIOUS SOFTWARE INTENDED TO CAUSE HARMFUL ACTIVITY.
DO NOT DEPLOY IF YOU AREN'T FULLY COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING.LLM scrapers are relentless and brutual. You may be able to keep them at bay
with this software - but it works by providing them with a neverending stream
of exactly what they are looking for. YOU ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT
CONTINUOUS CPU LOAD, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MARKOV MODULE ENABLED.There is not currently a way to differentiate between web crawlers that
are indexing sites for search purposes, vs crawlers that are training
AI models. ANY SITE THIS SOFTWARE IS APPLIED TO WILL LIKELY DISAPPEAR
FROM ALL SEARCH RESULTS.Expected usage is to hide the tarpit behind nginx or Apache, or whatever else you have implemented your
site in. Directly exposing it to the internet is ill advised. We want it to look as innocent and normal
as possible; in addition HTTP headers are used to configure the tarpit.I'll be using nginx configurations for examples. Here's a real world snippet for the demo above:    location /nepenthes-demo/ {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8893;
            proxy_set_header X-Prefix '/nepenthes-demo';
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_buffering off;
    }
You'll see several headers are added here: "X-Prefix" tells the tarpit that all links should go to that
path. Make this match what is in the 'location' directive. X-Forwarded-For is optional, but will make any
statistics gathered significantly more useful.The proxy_buffering directive is important. LLM crawlers typically disconnect if not given a response within
a few seconds; Nepenthes counters this by drip-feeding a few bytes at a time. Buffering breaks this workaround.You can have multiple proxies to an individual Nepenthes instance; simply set the X-Prefix header accordingly.You can use Docker, or install manually.A Dockerfile and compose.yaml is provided in the /docker directory.
Simply tweak the configuration file to your preferences, 'docker compose up'. You will still need to bootstrap
a Markov corpus if you enable the feature (see next section.)For Manual installation, you'll need to install Lua (5.4 preferred), SQLite (if using Markov), and OpenSSL.
The following Lua modules need to be installed - if they are all present in your package manager, use that;
otherwise you will need to install Luarocks and use it to install the following:Create a nepenthes user (you REALLY don't want this running as root.) Let's assume the user's home
directory is also your install directory.cd scratch/
tar -xvzf nepenthes-1.0.tar.gz
    cp -r nepenthes-1.0/* /home/nepenthes/
Tweak config.yml as you prefer (see below for documentation.) Then you're
ready to start:    su -l -u nepenthes /home/nepenthes/nepenthes /home/nepenthes/config.yml
Sending SIGTERM or SIGINT will shut the process down.Bootstrapping the Markov BabblerThe Markov feature requires a trained corpus to babble from. One was intentionally omitted because, ideally,
everyone's tarpits should look different to evade detection. Find a source of text in whatever language you
prefer; there's lots of research corpuses out there, or possibly pull in some very long Wikipedia articles,
maybe grab some books from Project Gutenberg, the Unix fortune file, it really doesn't matter at all. Be creative!Training is accomplished by sending data to a POST endpoint. This only needs to be done once. Sending training
data more than once cumulatively adds to the existing corpus, allowing you to mix different texts - or train in
chunks.Once you have your body of text, assuming it's called corpus.txt, in your working directory, and you're running
with the default port:curl -XPOST -d ./@corpus.txt -H'Content-type: text/plain' http://localhost:8893/train
This could take a very, VERY long time - possibly hours. curl may potentially time out. See
load.sh in the nepenthes distribution for a script that
incrementally loads training data.The Markov module returns an empt string if there is no corpus. Thus, the tarpit will continue to function
as a tarpit without a corpus loaded. The extra CPU consumed for this check is almost nothing.Want to see what prey you've caught? There are several statistics endpoints, all returning JSON. To see everything:http://{http_host:http_port}/stats
To see user agent strings only:http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/agents
Or IP addresses only:
3
http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/ips/These can get quite big; so it's possible to filter both 'agents' and 'ips', simply add a minimum hit count to the
URL. For example, to see a list of all IPs that have visted more than 100 times:http://{http_host:http_port}/stats/ips/100
Simply curl the URLs, pipe into 'jq' to pretty-print as desired. Script away!Nepenthes used DefensivelyA link to a Nepenthes location from your site will flood out valid URLs
within your site's domain name, making it unlikely the crawler will access
real content.In addition, the aggregated statistics will provide a list of IP addresses
that are almost certainly crawlers and not real users. Use this list to
create ACLs that block those IPs from reaching your content - either return
403, 404, or just block at the firewall level.Integration with fail2ban or blocklistd (or similar) is a future possibility,
allowing realtime reactions to crawlers, but not currently implemented.Using Nepenthes defensively, it would be ideal to turn off the Markov
module, and set both max_delay and min_delay to something large, as a
way to conserve your CPU.Nepenthes used OffensivelyLet's say you've got horsepower and bandwidth to burn, and just want to
see these AI models burn. Nepenthes has what you need:Don't make any attempt to block crawlers with the IP stats. Put the delay
times as low as you are comfortable with. Train a big Markov corpus and
leave the Markov module enabled, set the maximum babble size to something
big. In short, let them suck down as much bullshit as they have diskspace
for and choke on it.All possible directives in config.yaml:http_host : sets the host that Nepenthes will listen on; default is localhost only.http_port : sets the listening port number; default 8893prefix: Prefix all generated links should be given. Can be overriden with the X-Prefix HTTP header. Defaults to nothing.templates: Path to the template files. This should be the '/templates' directory inside your Nepenthes installation.detach: If true, Nepenthes will fork into the background and redirect logging output to Syslog.pidfile: Path to drop a pid file after daemonization. If empty, no pid file is created.max_wait: Longest amount of delay to add to every request. Increase to slow down crawlers; too slow they might not come back.min_wait: The smallest amount of delay to add to every request. A random value is chosen between max_wait and min_wait.real_ip_header: Changes the name of the X-Forwarded-For header that communicates the actual client IP address for statistics gathering.prefix_header: Changes the name of the X-Prefix header that overrides the prefix configuration variable.forget_time: length of time, in seconds, that a given user-agent can go missing before being deleted from the statistics table.forget_hits: A user-agent that generates more than this number of requests will not be deleted from the statistics table.persist_stats: A path to write a JSON file to, that allows statistics to survive across crashes/restarts, etcseed_file: Specifies location of persistent unique instance identifier. This allows two instances with the same corpus to have different looking tarpits.words: path to a dictionary file, usually '/usr/share/dict/words', but could vary depending on your OS.markov: Path to a SQLite database containing a Markov corpus. If not specified, the Markov feature is disabled.markov_min: Minimum number of words to babble on a page.markov_max: Maximum number of words to babble on a page. Very large values can cause serious CPU load.Version numbers use a simple process: If the only changes are fully backwards
compatible, the minor number changes. If the user/administrator needs to change
anything after or part of the upgrade, the major number changes and the minor
number resets to zero.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft patches Windows to eliminate Secure Boot bypass threat</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-patches-windows-to-eliminate-secure-boot-bypass-threat/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:24:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past seven months—and likely longer—an industry-wide standard that protects Windows devices from firmware infections could be bypassed using a simple technique. On Tuesday, Microsoft finally patched the vulnerability. The status of Linux systems is still unclear.Tracked as CVE-2024-7344, the vulnerability made it possible for attackers who had already gained privileged access to a device to run malicious firmware during bootup. These types of attacks can be particularly pernicious because infections hide inside the firmware that runs at an early stage, before even Windows or Linux has loaded. This strategic position allows the malware to evade defenses installed by the OS and gives it the ability to survive even after hard drives have been reformatted. From then on, the resulting "bootkit" controls the operating system start.In place since 2012, Secure Boot is designed to prevent these types of attacks by creating a chain-of-trust linking each file that gets loaded. Each time a device boots, Secure Boot verifies that each firmware component is digitally signed before it’s allowed to run. It then checks the OS bootloader's digital signature to ensure that it's trusted by the Secure Boot policy and hasn't been tampered with. Secure Boot is built into the UEFI—short for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface—the successor to the BIOS that’s responsible for booting modern Windows and Linux devices.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nintendo announces the Switch 2 [video]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ</link><author>HelloUsername</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:08:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unbundling the Enterprise • Stephen Fishman, Matt McLarty &amp; Erik Wilde • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdZ1U9zvU90</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 13:01:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

It's bad for my health, so why do I keep doing it?  Because once in a while, I'll find a post so good that it teaches me something I never knew before, and all the scrolling feels worth it.
But I've stumbled upon an old piece of free and open source tech, relatively unknown today, which is THE solution of solving the problems with modern media without sacrificing accessible, good content: RSS. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter — platforms built for engagement, not efficiency. Instead of showing you high-quality posts upfront, they pad your feed with memes, spam, and astroturfing. There is only so much 'good' content created in a day. By padding your feed with trash, they make the limited amount of good posts "last longer". 
These sites want you to spend more time scrolling on their website, so they feed you scraps which makes the occasional great post feels like a jackpot.
This concept, operant conditioning, was developed by B.F. Skinner — Yes, the mind behind the Skinnerbox.While some sites offer filtering or sorting options, manually settings these options every time you want to access a subreddit is just not doable.  You could, of course, stop consuming content from these websites. However, this would mean potentially missing really good content; content you'd learn from, interesting ideas, and more.
But it doesn't have to be this way. You can reclaim your attention span while still having access to the same quality content as before.  RSS is like your youtube subscription feed in hyperdrive. Subscribe to sites you love and decide what shows up — no exploitative social media algorithm needed. No more ads or algorithms deciding how to keep you doomscrolling. This 1999 tech actually solves a lot of 2025 problems.
Here's the kicker: Most websites, even social media, quietly support RSS feeds.You can filter out keywords, set minimum upvotes or like counts, and much more! Modern RSS clients allow you to make filters using Regex, and there are a  of software and services you can use to tune up your filtering to 11.TL;DR: Never see noise, and never miss hidden gems again!But how do you get started with RSS? It's easier than you think!I personally self-host an open source RSS reader: Tiny Tiny RSS
If you don't want to host it yourself, you can google for companies offering easy and accessible RSS readers.To make it easier, let's differentiate between three levels of ease when it comes to adding a website to RSS: Easy, medium, and hard.
I'll be going over how to add several popular sites to your feed.Want a youtube channel in your RSS feed? Just copy the channel's URL and subscribe to it in your reader. Done.If you like games, you might want to subscribe to IGN. There's no clear RSS button, so the best course of action would be to google "IGN RSS".This leads to a nice IGN RSS Feeds page with multiple categorized feeds for you to pick from. If you wanted to subscribe to "Game Articles", you'd right-click on the game articles link, press "copy link", go to your RSS reader of choice and subscribe to the link you copied.  Now all IGN Game Articles will show up in your RSS feed as they are published!Some websites don't have a dedicated RSS button, but still support RSS. You can discover their RSS urls by adding .rss, atom.xml, feed, etc. at the end of the site's URL, for example https://website.com/atom.xml. Almost all RSS readers support Atom feeds. For more examples, check this Reddit comment.Some sites like HackerNews have RSS support. However, this RSS can be extremely limited if you want to filter posts so your feed isn't spammed by low effort content. Some people are nice enough to set up a "middleman" between your RSS feed and the website, so you can pull the RSS feed through the middleman while doing actions like filtering it.For example, if you wanted to subscribe to HackerNews but filter out low upvote count posts, you could subscribe to HNRSS instead of through HN directly. For example, I filter out posts below 150 upvotes by to this url: https://hnrss.org/newest?points=150
Sometimes these services open-source their code so you can self-host the 'middleman'.When removing the optional search term from a reddit search URL, don't forget to remove the 
When removing the sort options
If adding more search terms, add a + between them!I love managing my homelab. I follow /r/homelab. Some posts are really good and teach me a lot.
However, there's a lot of noise posted to that subreddit; I do not want to see memes, and pictures of people's hardware setup gets boring quick. I'm interested in hidden gems, threads where a lot of interesting info is explained, things I can really learn a lot from.Step 1: Filter out picture posts.Reddit hack: Filter out picture posts by searching for 'self:true' in a subreddit. Bonus: You can subscribe to that specific search query as a RSS feed for text posts only.So instead of subscribing to a subreddit's RSS directly, you do a search for posts in that subreddit and then subscribe to  RSS feed.
The RSS link you should subscribe to should look someting like this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on
You can change 'homelab' to your subreddit of choice.The  parameter in the URL (probably) means "Restrict_subreddit". Removing this from the search will yield results from different subreddits than the one you're searching in. If you think that parameter is redundant, I agree.There are a  of text-only submissions on /r/homelab. Gems are relatively sparce. Lots of low quality content. It's not the subreddit's fault; this is standard across Reddit.Step 2: Filter for qualitySeems easy; let's add a 'minimal upvotes' query to the search, right?
Sadly, Reddit doesn't support that.. a shame, really.
However, a workaround is sorting by 'Top' and asking the search to show us the 'top posts of this week'. Note: 'This week' would mean 'past 7 days' instead of 'posted this week'.Filtering by 'Top of ...' always returns 25 items. This means that if you sort by 'top of this week', on average of 25/7=3,57 NEW posts get added to your feed each day! This is a great way to only see the highest scoring posts of each day.Adding this sort on top of the RSS feed from step 1 results in an URL like this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/search.rss?q=self%3Atrue&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=yearIf you don't care about only seeing text posts, removing  does  work for RSS feeds, even though it does work for direct searches. Instead, subscribe to the subreddit's "top" RSS and filter by time. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/top.rss?t=monthFor reference, here is how many posts you would get in your RSS feed, depening on your reddit sorting:And just like that, we converted a high-noise subreddit to an RSS feed which only gives us the best the subreddit has to offer.If you wanted to subscribe to all new posts in a subreddit, you would subscribe to an url like https://www.reddit.com/r/SUBREDDIT_NAME/new/.rss?sort=new. For a more extensive Reddit RSS guide, see this postSome sites might not have support for an RSS feed. Sometimes you can get away with a neat google trick:Most of the time you'd need something to generate the RSS for you. You could use one of many RSS feed generators available online, or host one yourself. Most of these feed generators have enhanced filtering tools as well.I haven't had to do this yet, however I've heard really good things about the open source RSS-BridgeHow you'd set up a feed generator depends on the software, so I won't expand upon that here.Separating yourself from the algorithmic whims of social media platform is easier than ever. With RSS, you can stay informed, save time, and never miss the content that truly matters.To end this post, here is a list of (RSS supported) sites I think are really interesting.
Linked are excellent articles for first-time readers!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Digital Forensics with Emre Tinaztepe</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/16/digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=digital-forensics-with-emre-tinaztepe</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2025 10:00:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Digital forensics is the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting electronic data for investigative purposes.

Can you outline the main components of the system (e.g., clients, APIs, databases, caching, load balancers) and explain how they interact? Can your design handle increased traffic or scale with user growth?  Can you address single points of failure and ensure fault tolerance? Can you explain the pros and cons of your decisions and justify your choices? Can you dive into the details of critical components (e.g., database schema, caching strategy, API design)?Bottlenecks and Edge Cases: Can you identify potential issues and propose strategies to mitigate them? Can you articulate your ideas clearly and engage in a constructive discussion with the interviewer? Are you receptive to feedback and able to refine your design? Can you manage your time effectively and focus on high-impact components? Are you familiar with common system design patterns (e.g., sharding, replication, caching)? Can you discuss tools or technologies relevant to the problem?System design interviews typically last , which means managing your time effectively is crucial.A well-structured approach ensures you cover all key aspects of the design while leaving room for discussion and feedback with the interviewer.Here’s a framework you can follow:Clarifying Requirements (5-10 minutes): Understand functional and non-functional needs.High-Level Design (10-15 minutes): Outline the system's main components and overall architecture (e.g., clients, database, cache, load balancer, messaging queues).Database Design (5-8 minutes): Choose the appropriate database type (SQL, NoSQL, or hybrid). Define schemas and discuss partitioning, indexing, replication, and caching.API Design (5-8 minutes): Define intuitive and scalable APIs. List critical endpoints and their purpose.Deep Dive into Key Components (15-20 minutes): Discuss 2-3 critical components in detail.Handling Trade-Offs and Edge Cases (5-10 minutes): Highlight trade-offs, bottlenecks, and failure handling. Propose mitigation strategies.Address scalability, security and monitoring (5-10 minutes): Explain how your design handles growth, ensures security, and incorporates monitoring.You can adjust this framework based on the problem type and requirements.I haven’t included  here but I recommend minimal capacity estimation at the start to set context (e.g., "The system will handle 1 million requests per day").Avoid detailed calculations unless explicitly required. You don’t want to waste your precious time doing unnecessary maths calculation.A common mistake many candidates make is jumping directly into designing the system without fully understanding what needs to be built.System design questions are intentionally  and often underspecified. Interviewers deliberately withhold details, expecting you to ask the right questions to uncover the information you need.To succeed, start by clarifying the —the  and  the system must support.At this stage, avoid thinking about design, implementation, or technical specifics. The primary goal is to define  needs to be built, not  to build it or the scale it needs to support. Focus purely on understanding the "what."Based on the problem, list down the core features and use cases and confirm them with the interviewer.What specific features does the system need?Are there any must-have or optional features?What are the main objects and their relations?How the objects will interact with each other and access pattern?Can the system’s objects be modified after creation?What types of data will the system handle? For a chat application:Users should be able to send and receive messages.The primary objects are users and messages.Users should view all messages in chronological order.Messages may be edited or deleted after being sent.Messages may include text, images, and videos.Your aim is to ask just enough questions to gather a clear picture of all important use cases for the system.Once functional requirements are well-defined, shift your focus to non-functional requirements.These describe  the system should perform its functions.The most common non-functional requirements you should consider in a system design interview are: How quickly should the system respond to user requests? Should the system tolerate downtime? If yes, how much? Is strong or eventual consistency required? Are there any special security considerations or workflows?Questions to Clarify NFRs:What is the  of the system?How many users should it support?How many requests per second should the server handle?Is  acceptable? What is the cost of downtime for this system?Is the system  or ? What is the read-to-write ratio?Should updates be visible to users instantly, or is a delay acceptable?Are there any specific  concerns? Are there workflows involving sensitive data or code execution? For a chat application: 1 million daily active users, with up to 10,000 concurrent users per server. Aim for 99.99% uptime (no more than ~52 minutes of downtime per year). High read volume as users fetch messages frequently compared to writing messages. Messages should appear in real-time for recipients.This post is for paid subscribers.

Soldiers in the Continental Army kept diaries as records of their service during the American Revolution, writing in them almost daily. These personal entries vary from short notations about the weather, to longer descriptions of their experiences and observations. However, new evidence suggests that on certain campaigns, a unique practice took place – soldiers sharing their diaries.

Our speakers will delve into the discovery of this unusual practice, closely examining the rare and overlooked examples to understand why soldiers shared their personal diaries and why they only did so during specific campaigns. Entries appear to have been copied from one soldier to another for certain periods of time, sometimes as long as months!

This lecture is an opportunity to engage with sources that have never been published and consider a practice rarely discussed in academic literature, all the while learning about some key campaigns of the American Revolutionary War as told by the soldiers themselves.

The plan has been to wind up after we finished the pipeline of ideas we were working on. And as of the last Ponzi cases we just completed and are sharing with regulators, that day is today.I write this from a place of joy. Building this has been a life’s dream.I did not know at the outset if it would be possible to find a fulfilling path. This wasn’t an easy option, but I was naïve to the danger and felt drawn to it magnetically.When I started this, I doubted I was capable. I didn’t have a traditional finance background. None of my relatives are in this field. I went to a state school. I’m not a slick salesperson. I don’t know any of the right clothes to wear. I can’t play golf. I’m not some superhuman that can function on 4 hours of sleep. In most of my jobs I was a good worker but mostly looked over. I had no money when I started—and after catching 3 lawsuits immediately out of the gate, I quickly had less than no money. I would have failed right at the starting line had it not been for the support of world-class whistleblower lawyer Bryan Wood, who took the cases on despite my lack of financial resources. I had a newborn child and was facing eviction at the time. I was terrified, but knew that if I stayed still I would crumble. The only option I had was to keep moving forward.It is very easy to succumb to negative thoughts and believe what others think of you, especially when things feel low. But it is possible to shatter all of that. I was passionate about this and I let that carry me forward despite my fears and insecurities.And then this slowly started to flourish.One at a time, and without a clear plan, we built a team of 11 incredible people. I hired each of them not because we needed workers, but because when our paths crossed and I could see who they were, I realized it was madness not to bring them on.They are all smart, focused, and fun to work with. Little to no ego. When you meet them, they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes to this field, they are ruthless assassins, capable of world-class work. Like me, our team didn’t come from traditional finance backgrounds. My first hire often describes himself as a former bartender. We all have a shared view of the world, a mostly calm exterior, and a similar burning underlying intensity. They are all family to me.We have all worked extremely hard, with a focus on precision and letting the evidence dictate our words.Sometimes this meant taking big swings and taking on fights that are much bigger than any of us as individuals. Fraud, corruption, and negativity often seem overwhelming. Early on, a sense of justice was usually elusive. When it happened, it was tremendously fulfilling. It kept us going when we needed it.And boy did we have an impact, eventually—more than I imagined was possible at the outset. Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking.Over time, people began to see what I hoped we could show—that having an impact is possible, no matter who you are.It has also been rather intense, and at times, all-encompassing. I often wake up from my dreams because I’ve thought of a new investigative thread to pull on in my sleep, or an edit that clarifies a point I didn’t realize I was troubled by during the day. Or from the general pressure of it all. We are not fearless—we just have faith in the truth and hope it leads us down the right path.I’m grateful for all of it. We have days of bizarre, hilarious and ridiculous stories and we’ve had a lot of fun amidst the pressure and challenges. It has been the adventure of a lifetime.So, why disband now? There is not one specific thing—no particular threat, no health issue, and no big personal issue.Someone once told me that at a certain point a successful career becomes a selfish act. Early on, I felt I needed to prove some things to myself. I have now finally found some comfort with myself, probably for the first time in my life. I probably could have had it all along had I let myself, but I needed to put myself through a bit of hell first. The intensity and focus has come at the cost of missing a lot of the rest of the world and the people I care about. I now view Hindenburg as a chapter in my life, not a central thing that defines me.Beyond my own desire for relief, it also feels selfish to keep the knowledge we’ve accumulated trapped within our small team. I have more than enough. In the past several years we’ve been flooded with thousands of messages from many of you asking how we do what we do, or whether you can join the team. I read them all and I’ve been trying to figure out how to respond in a way that can answer everyone—so over the next 6 months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations.My hope is that after we fully share our process, in a couple years I will get an unsolicited message from someone who reads this (maybe you), who embraces the same passion, learns the craft, and finds the confidence to shed some light on a subject that needs it, despite the obstacles in your way. That would make my day, even if I’m off trying to learn music or planting a garden or whatever I end up doing next.For now, I will be focused on making sure everyone on our team lands where they want to be next. Some are going to start their own research firm, which I will strongly and publicly encourage, even as I will have no personal involvement. There are others on our team who are now free agents—so feel free to reach out to me if you have a need for anyone who is brilliant, focused, and easy to work with, as they all are.It wasn’t always obvious to me, but I now view all of this as a love story. To my wife, you have been so patient with me. It has not been easy, to put it mildly, and I am forever grateful that you have sacrificed so much and pushed forward with me. And now, my dear, we get to enjoy it together for as long as this world will let us.To my family and friends, I’m sorry for the times I have ignored you while I let my attention be drawn away. I can’t wait to have more time to share with you together.Lastly, I want to express how grateful I am to our readers. Your messages of kindness and encouragement through the years have gone a long way to help give us the strength to continue. And it constantly reminds me that the world is filled with good. Thank you for all of it—I couldn’t ask for more. It is all a blessing.With unfathomable levels of gratitude,(P.S. If you are chasing something you think you want or need, or are doubting whether you are enough, take a minute and give this a listen. It had a big impact on me at a pivotal time.)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Did the Fire Hydrants Run Dry in the Pacific Palisades?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E7qrP9CdRk</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 21:17:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When fire hydrants ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire, it sparked a wave of anger and even misinformation.

Are we all living in The Matrix? Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with actor Laurence Fishburne to explore the science of The Matrix, simulation theory, and who has the better deep voice. Would you take the red pill? 

Would you rather have truth or normalcy? We explore the choice Morpheus presents Neo and how it pertains to science. Laurence shares the experience of bringing Morpheus to life. He and Neil unpack the film’s profound symbolism as well as discuss the blending of ancient mythology with the emerging digital age.

We analyze the plausibility of the movie’s central premise. Can humans really serve as batteries for machines? We explore simulation theory, pondering whether our universe could be one of many nested simulations, as posed by Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom. From the optical science behind the iconic spoon-bending scene to the film’s intricate religion and philosophy, we explore the storytelling elements that make The Matrix timeless.

Neil connects its themes to questions about reality, truth, and human potential. Plus, a few surprises—including the “deep voice-off” and musings on why gods always have baritone voices—make this episode a must-listen for movie buffs and science enthusiasts alike.

But this knowledge is in danger of disappearing. Leticia Yawanawa has an ambitious plan: she wants to preserve herbal medicine for posterity.

The deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest is having a devastating impact on the global climate. But it is also displacing indigenous tribes and eradicating their unique knowledge of the healing powers of nature. 
Scientists agree that only a third of the total biodiversity of the rainforest has been researched. Much of the knowledge is in the heads of indigenous scholars. This understanding is passed on orally, from generation to generation. Many tribes are being driven out of their habitats. The knowledge of the shamans - who in addition to their spiritual duties treat their people medicinally using plants and herbs from the jungle - is in danger of being lost forever. 
In the documentary, Leticia brings together shamans from different tribes and asks them to share their knowledge. They set off on journeys through the rainforest, often lasting days. Here, they share their knowledge of medicinal plants, along with traditional rites and ceremonies. We learn about the healing powers of plants and herbs. Some may be familiar to us, while others are known only to local indigenous populations.

ABSTRACT
How can you work effectively with AI as your colleague?

Since March 2023 (the release of GPT4) I've worked almost fulltime with AI-powered software development. Both as a productivity tool, to get work done faster and better, and also as way of building new types of products and features that were previously impossible. In fact, GenAI has completely changed the way I work and the way I look at software development. It feels like I've gained superpowers, but I've had to unlearn and change habits that I've built up over 30 years.

Coding with AI is a very different way of working. And like any other skill, you kind of suck at it at first but improve with practice. The transition to this strange new world can be jarring, but it is unavoidable. Being a developer in 2024 and not coding with AI is the equivalent of being 2022 and manually writing machine code or manually creating punched cards.

In this talk I'll share practical experiences from AI-powered software development - tips, tricks, and pitfalls - using mostly live demos. These techniques will reduce your time from Idea to Working Code, which is a nice feeling 🙂 [...]

This is useful when you frequently connect to the same server using SSH protocol for remote login, server management, using IT automation tools over SSH or even running hourly backups. However, sometimes your SSH command (client) will not respond or get hung up on the session when using multiplexing. Typically, this happens when your public IP changes (IPv4 to IPv6 changes when using DNS names), VPN issues, or firewall cuts connections. Hence, knowing SSH client control commands can save you time and boost your productivity when such gotchas occur. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Parallels Can Now Run x86 Windows and Linux On Apple Silicon Mac</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/01/15/0216248/parallels-can-now-run-x86-windows-and-linux-on-apple-silicon-mac?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop now supports running 64-bit x86 operating systems on Apple Silicon Macs through its proprietary emulation engine, enabling users to run traditional Windows and Linux distributions. However, performance is said to be "really slow." How-To Geek reports: The latest Parallels Desktop 20.2 update adds early support for x86 emulation on Apple Silicon, allowing traditional x86 PC operating systems to work on newer Mac computers. There were already apps like UTM that could do it (most of them are based on QEMU), but this feature uses Parallels' "proprietary emulation engine" paired with Apple's built-in hypervisor. [...] Parallels on Apple Silicon can now "run existing x86_64 Windows 10, Windows 11*, Windows Server 2019/2022, and some Linux distributives with UEFI BIOS via Parallels Emulator." You can also create new Windows 10 21H2 and Windows Server 2022 virtual machines if needed.
 
There are some big limitations. You can only run 64-bit x86 operating systems -- sorry, FreeDOS fans -- but those 64-bit operating systems can run 32-bit applications. There's also no support for USB devices, nested virtualization (so WSL2 won't work), or the Parallels hypervisor. Performance will also be "really slow," since x86 instructions have to be translated to ARM. The company said, "Windows boot time is about 2-7 minutes, depending on your hardware. Windows operating system responsiveness is also low."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nobody cares</title><link>https://grantslatton.com/nobody-cares</link><author>fzliu</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 04:15:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[N.B. I'm in a mood tonight, so this will be less of a well-considered essay and more of a rant, partially in the vein of . Don't take anything here  seriously.Why does nobody care about anything? The world is full of stuff that could be excellent with just 1% more effort. But people don't care.Have you been to the DMV? It sucked? There is a human being whose job it is to be in charge of the DMV. They do not care that it sucks.Ever used a piece of software that's buggy as hell, looks bad, but still costs money, presumably because the company behind it has found some regulatory capture to justify their existence? The programmer who wrote it probably doesn't care. Their manager definitely doesn't care. The regulators don't care.I've met a few people that work for municipal governments. Not politicians, just career bureaucrats deep in the system. I ask them what their favorite part of the job is. They all say "stability" or "job security" as their #1. It takes 18 months to get the city to permit your shed? They. Do. Not. Care.Here's a dumb example. This bike lane ends at the bottom of a hill near me. It merges onto the sidewalk at a crazy sharp angle. Cyclists are coming down this hill at 20mph or so. Tons of people can't make this angle at that speed and hit the vertical curb face, damaging their bike and injuring themselves. If they're unlucky, they go flying into the signpost.Why does this ramp suck so much? For literally the exact same effort it took to build, it could have been built 10x better. Make the angle 20 degrees instead of 70. Put the ramp just after the sign instead of just before it. Make the far curb face sloped instead of vertical. Put some visual indication the lane ends 50 feet uphill. Why wasn't this done?Because the engineer who designed it and the managers at the department of transportation do not give a shit.This isn't even a pro- or anti-bikes thing. The ramp was getting built by whatever mandate. You're the engineer. Do you make it bad, or do you spend 1% more time thinking about it and make it good for literally the same cost? You make it bad, because you do not care.I actually pointed this ramp out to the director of the Seattle Department of Transportation during a walking tour. He made a note of it over a year ago that I assume was promptly forgotten about. He does not care.These new lights objectively suck to anyone not driving. If your house is near one, they suck. If you're walking your dog at night (which starts at 5PM for much of the year in Seattle), they  suck.But whoever made the decision to switch the lights does not care. It's entirely possible they don't even live in the city, but instead live in a pleasant exurb. Or maybe they don't walk at night and have never considered that other people do.White LEDs reduce car crashes by 0.1% and that is measurable, but sleep quality and aesthetics are not measurable. You just have to care about them. And nobody cares.But that's enough city stuff. Plenty of people don't care about plenty of other things.You put on your turn signal in traffic to merge. The person who could let you in is looking straight ahead, zoned out. Why would they look around to see if they could cooperate with anyone? They're already in the lane they need to be in. They. Do. Not. Care.You're at the airport. There's a group in front of you on the escalator taking up the full width, preventing anyone from walking by. They do not care.You're on the sidewalk and someone has headphones in, walking in the center of the path. A mom and stroller are behind them. They can't hear her "excuse me" to get their attention. They have not even considered the possibility that anyone in the world exists but them. They do not care.The McDonald's touch-screen self-order kiosk takes 27 clicks to get a meal. They try to up-sell you 3 times. Just let me pay for my fucking burger, Jesus Christ. The product manager, the programmer, the executives. None of these people care.At work the junior engineer sends you some code to review. The code was clearly written in a first draft, and then just iteratively patched until the tests passed, then immediately sent to you to review without any further improvement. They do not care.The guy on the hiking trail is playing his shitty EDM on his bluetooth speaker, ruining nature for everyone else. He does not care.The doctor misdiagnoses your illness whose symptoms are in the first paragraph of the trivially googleable wikipedia article. He does not care.People don't pick up after their dogs. The guy at the gym doesn't re-rack the weights. The lady at the grocery store leaves the cart in the middle of the parking lot. They. Do. Not. Care.I could continue in this vein for another few pages, but it would be boring and you get the point. We are surrounded by antisocial bastards.Some of them like the people who don't pick up after their dogs are legitimately just assholes.Others, like the bureaucrats in the city who mess up our lives in more indirect ways are more victims of The System. But they are still guilty of lacking the personal agency to fight it or leave in protest, and I still — potentially unjustly — condemn them.We have examples like Elon who, through sheer force of will, defeats armies of people who don't care. For his many faults, you can't say the man doesn't care.When I  my former Big Tech job, everyone cared. Over time, incentives attracted a different set of people who didn't care as much. Eventually those people became the majority. It's painful to work with people who don't care if you care a lot, and eventually I left because of it.Now, I'm at a small startup full of people who care. Customer bug reports go right to our chatroom. We fix them immediately. I feel guilty I wrote the bugs at all. We reach out to users to see if we can make their lives better. We care.I want to live in a community where everyone cares.The one place in the world you get this vibe is probably Japan. Most people just . Patrick McKenzie refers to this as the will to have nice things. Japan has it, and the US mostly does not.In Japan, you get the impression that everyone takes their job and role in society seriously. The median Japanese 7-11 clerk takes their job more seriously than the median US city bureaucrat. And the result is obvious if you visit both places.Is it possible for us to care in the US? To foster the will to have nice things? I think we actually had this in the aftermath of WW2. The country was mostly on the same page about progress, values, the future. But over a few generations, more and more people defect. Living among defectors is demoralizing and causes more defections (much like my own departure from my Big Tech job!). Eventually society is full of defectors.But I don't think this is a full explanation. Most people aren't , they merely won't go  to add to the world. And I can feel myself getting pulled in that direction.I used to go a lot more out of my way to add to the world. A few years ago, I installed a bunch of dog bag dispensers on the telephone poles of my neighborhood. I still keep them stocked.I was, somewhat naively, hoping that somehow I could get a snowball of care going. I built curb ramps on legacy curbs that lacked them. I lobbied the city to open new park space. Improve crosswalks. And much more!But the snowball never started. Nobody cares. Rather, there is a tiny minority of activists who care. They spend all their free time doing activist stuff — basically fighting the city to try to make the bureaucrats care about little bits here and there.But I've come to accept that I just don't have the disposition to fight all the time. I'm not a fighter. I care  and I just want to live in a place where other people care.We're not going to move to Japan, but would absolutely be willing to move within the US.Does such a community really exist? Where  cares? Or at least a supermajority? Or does it need to be built?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Who Owns Greenland?</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/who-owns-greenland</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 00:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NuPhy Air60HE keyboard review (Gateron Low-profile Magnetic Jade Pro)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGI03Vdsj5s</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:31:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Skip to 7:40 for a typing demonstration.

It has a big roster of heroes with a ton of variety across them, no role queue, and 6v6, all of which are important to a great hero shooter. Although it lifts more than a few of Overwatch's ideas, it is actively targeting and addressing some of the biggest complaints players have about Blizzard's shooter. Marvel Rivals expands on familiar ideas in smart ways and has a visually striking and distinct art style. Add in that it's a fun multiplayer experience and it makes it far more than just another also-ran hero shooter clone.Opting for 6v6 and a third-person camera view, Marvel Rivals has a vast variety of playstyles across its launch roster. Offering everything from simple shooting-focused heroes like Punisher to complex melee heroes like Spider-Man, all the while making it feel cohesive. Although it will undoubtedly be chaotic for players trying a hero shooter like this for the first time, there are a variety of heroes that make picking up the game simple and an impressive roster of alternative picks that can gradually increase complexity.It does have limited main game modes at launch, with only Domination, which involves fighting over a control point; Convoy, where a team escorts a payload; and Convergence, which is a combination of the two. These are split across a variety of maps taken from the Marvel multiverse, with locations like Tokyo 2099, Yggsgard, and the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda. These different locations provide a ton of environmental variety, with the pristine look of Asgard contrasted with the dense buildings of Tokyo 2099. While the visual styles don't change the flow of the game, the map layouts do. For example, both Tokyo 2099 and Klyntar have hybrid maps--where the attacking team must capture a control point, which unlocks a payload to push--but Tokyo 2099 has multiple buildings blocking the defenders' line of sight, while on Klyntar the area from spawn to the point is much more open, promoting more long-range hero options. It can become visually stale, but more importantly, having fewer modes means that your team's strategies don't shift as much from match to match, which can result in them blending together because each individual match doesn't feel unique, aside from the team compositions.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Europe Rebuilt After WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqljXZGTfug</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the world breathed a sigh of relief at the end of the largest, bloodiest conflict in human history, more struggle was already on the horizon.

These screens occupy the dimensions of your terminal by default. While you can have many different screens in a single application, only one screen may be active at a time.When you create your  class, Textual will create a screen object implicitly. Yes, Textual requires you to have at least one screen or your application won’t work. If you do not create a new screen or switch to a different one, the default screen is where your widgets will get mounted or composed to.Screens are a great way to organize your application. Many applications have settings pages, help pages, and more. These are just a few examples of how you can use screens.Now that you know what a screen is, you’re ready to learn how to create new ones!When you create an application, you create a  implicitly. But how do you create your own ? Fortunately, Textual has made that easy. All you need to do is import the  class from  and extend it as needed.You can style screens the same way you do other widgets, except for the dimensions as screens are always the same size as your terminal window.To see how this all works, you will create an application with two screens:You second screen, which will be greenYou will be able to switch between the screens using a button. Each screen has its own button and its own event or message handler.Open up your favorite Python IDE and create a new file called  with the following contents:# two_screens.py

from textual import on
from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Button

class GreenScreen(Screen):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Button("Main Screen", id="main")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#main")
    def on_main(self) -> None:
        self.dismiss()


class MainAop(App):

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Button("Switch", id="switch")

    @on(Button.Pressed, "#switch")
    def on_switch(self) -> None:
        self.push_screen(GreenScreen())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()You use Textual’s handy  decorator to match against the button’s . That keeps the message from bubbling around to other event handlers, which is what could happen if you had used , for example.When you run your application, you will see something like this:Try clicking the buttons and switching between the screens.Of course, you don’t need to use button’s at all, if you don’t want to. You could use keyboard shortcuts instead. Why not give that a try?Go back to your Python IDE and create a new file called  with this code in it:# two_screens_keys_only.py

from textual.app import App, ComposeResult
from textual.screen import Screen
from textual.widgets import Label


class GreenScreen(Screen):
    BINDINGS = [("escape", "app.pop_screen", "Dismiss the screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        self.styles.background = "green"
        yield Label("Second Screen")


class MainAop(App):
    SCREENS = {"green": GreenScreen}
    BINDINGS = [("n", "push_screen('green')", "Green Screen")]

    def compose(self) -> ComposeResult:
        yield Label("Main screen")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = MainAop()
    app.run()Using keyboard shortcuts makes your code a little less verbose. However, since you aren’t using a  widget, the shortcuts are not shown on-screen to the user. When you are on the main screen, you must press the letter “n” on your keyboard to switch to the . Then when you want to switch back, you press “Esc” or escape.Here’s what the screen looks like on the :Now try using the keys mentioned to swap between the two screens. Feel free to change the keyboard bindings to keys of your own choosing.Textual can do much more with Screens than what is covered in this brief tutorial. However, you can use this information as a great starting point for learning how to add one more additional screens to your GUI in your terminal.Play around with these examples and then run over to the Textual documentation to learn about some of the other widgets you can add to bring your application to life.If you’d like to learn more about Textual, check out my book: Creating TUI Applications with Textual and Python, which you can find on the following websites:]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The dilemma of international egg donation: going abroad for a baby | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5jkJjPUjoY</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For some women, getting pregnant is only possible through egg donation. It’s a pathway to parenthood with children who aren’t biologically their own. While egg donation is legal in many countries, it’s banned in places like Switzerland and Germany.

When Sandra Cesna from Switzerland held the first positive pregnancy test in her hands, it was like a dream come true. With medical assistance, she and her husband will be able to have children. The egg came from a donor in Finland.

Since egg donation is prohibited in Switzerland and Germany, many women travel abroad to countries like Spain or Czechia, where donors are readily available. However, in these countries, donations are strictly anonymous, meaning the child will never know their genetic mother. In contrast, Finland offers a more open approach: Sandra Cesna’s child will have the option to contact the donor upon turning 18, if they wish to.

This film takes a compassionate look at the impact of this medical dilemma and the laws that often make little sense to the people who are affected by them. Why is sperm donation allowed in so many places, but not egg donation? Why do donors in so many places have to remain anonymous, even though it could cause emotional problems for the children? The film also shows that with an empathetic approach, it’s possible to avoid trauma and help children and families navigate this complicated journey.

This film asks the question, How do Native Hawaiians in the diaspora keep the feeling of Aloha in their hearts, even when they live thousands of miles away? Dear Aloha follows two Native Hawaiians living in the Pacific Northwest as they reflect on how “Aloha” sustains them amidst distance, loss, and longing. Meanwhile, back in Hawai’i, local residents grapple with the legacy of colonization that has resulted in many Hawaiians being displaced from their homeland.

'HOMEGROWN: A Part Of/Apart From' is a collection of short films from the U.S. territories and Hawaiʻi exploring issues of cultural identity, sovereignty, and agency, as residents and members of the diaspora grapple with what it means to be “a part of and apart from” the mainland U.S.

--

In 1935, researchers found that after removing the frontal lobes of two chimps, they no longer experienced frustration or anxiety. Neurologist Egas Moniz believed that replicating this in humans could cure mental illness— leading to one of the most controversial and destructive medical treatments of the 20th century: the lobotomy. Jenell Johnson uncovers the history of the procedure.

In today's video we look at a history of US border control and the economic costs of deporting more than six percent of the US workforce while the US workforce ages.

Both Donkey Kong Country and the Super Marios are classic side-scrolling platformers at their core, but DKC has been known less for joyful leaping and more for clenching your jaw. Now as the Nintendo Switch approaches its eighth year and Nintendo is increasingly reaching into its back catalog for ports, DKC Returns is back with a package that combines all the features of the Wii and 3DS versions--including some assists and visual enhancements--but still feels tough-as-nails in a way that could push away more casual platformer fans.DKC Returns HD does retain the tweaks made to the 2013 3DS port, including a Modern mode (originally called New mode in the 3DS version) with additional items in Cranky's shop and an extra pip of health. The items in Cranky's shop are especially tuned to let you selectively tweak the difficulty, since the banana coins currency are so plentiful that you'll almost always have enough to spare on an item or two. Those items range from help finding collectible puzzle pieces to temporary invincibility. You can always opt for the original mode to play with the original Wii difficulty, if that's more your flavor. And it does look nicely polished on Switch, especially on the OLED screen. That said, the character models look relatively simplistic compared to Tropical Freeze, a 2014 Wii U game that was already ported to Switch in 2018.The Modern mode is meant to sand off the edges of the notoriously punishing game and make it more approachable, but make no mistake: This is still a brutally difficult game. Even with three hearts instead of the original two, it's very easy to lose multiple lives (or near the end, tens of lives) in a single stage as you learn its rhythms and assorted traps. And the difficulty in DKC Returns is true to its roots, which centers heavily on memorization. The game frequently introduces threats too quickly to react to the first time, and DK himself feels stiff and heavy compared to the acrobatic Mario. Trickier stages will even give the appearance of one type of obstacle and then frustratingly punish you for reacting to the fake-out.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How To Lead Through Transformation in Tech • Hannah Foxwell &amp; Charles Humble • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La-oAqRr6cM</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2025 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted. #GOTOcon #GOTOunscripted

DESCRIPTION
Charles Humble and Hannah Foxwell explore the multifaceted challenges and opportunities presented by emerging technologies, modern work practices, and management dynamics.

They emphasize the importance of methodologies like pair programming, flexible work designs, and inclusive team environments, especially for accommodating neurodiverse and introverted individuals.
Foxwell introduces the “three-teams model” to guide new managers in aligning with direct reports, leadership peers, and cross-functional collaborators. She underscores the significance of equitable leadership through mentorship, coaching, and sponsorship, particularly for underrepresented groups.

Exploring  AI’s potential, Foxwell highlights its transformative impact on software development and enterprise processes while cautioning against rushed adoption. She advocates for thoughtful experimentation and user-centric design, noting the need for cultural and structural shifts to fully realize AI’s benefits. Ultimately, the conversation centers on intentionality, empathy, and the need for organizations to balance innovation with human-centric practices. [...]

You Need to Lay the Right FoundationCoding interviews aren’t just about algorithms—they’re about confidence.Yet one of the biggest fears is walking in and realizing you’re not prepared for the basics.The solution? Master these core areas:💡  Focus on one topic at a time. Consistency over cramming—it works.I remember spending hours on my first binary tree problem, convinced I’d never get it.But once I learned to break the problem down step by step, the complexity melted away.2. Then, You Need to Start Recognizing PatternsEver feel like you’ve solved hundreds of problems but still get stuck?It’s not about solving —it’s about solving smarter.Coding problems often follow predictable patterns.When you recognize the underlying structure, the solution becomes much simpler.Here are a few patterns worth mastering: Ideal for sorted arrays. For substring or interval problems. For efficiently finding an element in a sorted list.To answer range sum queries in constant time.For finding the next/previous greater or smaller element.For exploring all possible configurations.💡  Pick a pattern and dive deep. Solve 5–10 problems for each, focusing on understanding  the pattern works.Think of patterns like shortcuts on a map—they get you to the solution faster, with fewer dead ends.3. At Some Point, You Need to Simulate the Real DealHere’s the fear no one talks about: freezing during an interview.You know the material, but when it’s time to perform, your brain says, “Nope.”Sweaty palms, a simple BFS problem, and 20 minutes of staring at the screen like it was written in ancient Greek.Recreate interview conditions so the real thing feels like just another session.Set a timer and work on a problem without syntax hints.Use a whiteboard or plain text editor—no IDE crutches.Practice explaining your thought process out loud.💡  Schedule a mock interview with a peer or use an online platform.It’s awkward at first, but it’s the fastest way to build confidence.4. If You Don’t Have Much Time, You Need to Focus on High-Impact TopicsNot all topics are prioritized equally.Spending hours on niche problems might feel productive, but it won’t help when interviewers hit you with the classics. Search and Sorting algorithms, two pointers.: Reversal, cycle detection, and partitioning.: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversals. DFS, BFS, topological sorting, and shortest path algorithms.: Permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, and N-Queens problem.: Top-K elements, and merging K sorted lists.: Word search, autocomplete, and prefix matching. Problems like Knapsack or Longest Common Subsequence.💡  Track your progress on high-yield topics using tools like Notion or Trello.Seeing your wins pile up is a great motivator.The goal isn’t to know everything—it’s to be a pro at what matters most.5. If You Want to be an Engineer, You Need to Communicate Like an EngineerCoding interviews aren’t just about solving problems—they’re about showing  you solve problems.Clear communication sets you apart. Restate it to show you understand. Share your strategy before you start coding. Explain your logic, handle edge cases, and think aloud.💡  Record yourself solving a problem.Play it back to catch moments where you over-complicate or skip explanations.Interviewers don’t expect perfection—they expect clarity and problem-solving skills.6. And Finally, You Need to Build ResilienceLet’s talk about failure.It’s not if—it’s when. But every mistake is a step closer to mastery.During my ICPC journey, I submitted hundreds of wrong answers.Some were silly oversights; others were genuinely tough problems.But every “wrong answer” was a chance to learn something new.💡  Keep a failure journal.Write down problems you struggled with, what you learned, and how you’ll tackle similar issues in the future.Failure isn’t the end; it’s the beginning of better solutions.Here are a few resources I personally used to improve at problem-solving:Section for training as a team.Educational section to learn new topics.Highly engaged community and blogs where people go beyond the basics.Slightly advanced topics.The most beautiful algorithmic problems you will ever see.If you’ve ever doubted your ability to land that dream job, let me be the proof: persistence, focus, and the right system can transform everything.And leveraging your competitive advantage will change your life—more on that in this post:Competitive Programming Changed My Life ForeverI’m writing to you from Gothenburg, Sweden—a place where I’ve found the perfect balance between meaningful work and a fulfilling life…a month ago · 31 likes · 7 comments · Alberto GonzalezYour dream job isn’t just about a bigger paycheck.

To qualify, developers must have a 2024 commit in Torvalds' kernel git tree and email him with the subject "I WANT A GUITAR PEDAL". He'll pick a winner at random, use his own money to buy a pedal kit from a company called Aion FX, and then 'build it with my own shaky little fingers, and send it to the victim by US postal services.'" The Register reports: The odd offer appeared in his weekly state-of-the-kernel post, which on Sunday US time informed the Linux world that release candidate (rc) seven for version 6.13 of the Linux kernel "is slightly bigger than normal, but considering the timing, it's pretty much where I would have expected, and nothing really stands out." Torvalds therefore expects version 6.13 to debut next week, meaning it will arrive after his preferred seven release candidates and without delays caused by the usual holiday-period slowdown. Torvalds then added a postscript in which he revealed that he often uses the holiday season to build LEGO, which he frequently receives for Christmas and his late December birthday.
 
He kept up that tradition last year, but "also ended up doing a number of guitar pedal kit builds" which he described as "LEGO for grown-ups with a soldering iron." [...] Torvalds doesn't play guitar, but did the builds "because I enjoy the tinkering, and the guitar pedals actually do something and are the right kind of "not very complex, but not some 5-minute 555 LED blinking thing.'" He enjoyed the experience and wants to build more pedals, so has decided to give one away to a random kernel developer -- both as an act of generosity and to "check to see if anybody actually ever reads these weekly rc announcements of mine." Torvalds rated his past pedal-building efforts a "good success so far" but warned entrants "I'm a software person with a soldering iron."
 
"I will test the result to the best of my abilities, and the end result may actually work ... but you should set your expectations along the lines of "quality kit built by a SW person who doesn't know one end of a guitar from the other.'"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How William the Conqueror Rewrote History | Lucy Worsley Investigates</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k769WvKFP0</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/4gY7q1J | #LucyWorsleyPBS

It's the ultimate power fantasy, with each swing of your weapon sending bodies careening through the air in every conceivable direction as the KO counter ticks up into the thousands. For almost 25 years, this basic formula has remained virtually unchanged, lending the series a fervent albeit niche following. Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted to evolve the formula, but the shift to a lifeless open world was a misstep that didn't mesh with the series' core appeal. Dynasty Warriors: Origins, as the name implies, sees Omega Force returning to its roots, emphasizing the large-scale, hack-and-slash action Dynasty Warriors is known for while implementing a number of clever new additions that achieve what Dynasty Warriors 9 failed to.If you're unfamiliar with the long-running series, Dynasty Warriors is based on Luo Guanzhong's 14th-century novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms--and the ancient history it's based on--loosely adapting the classic Chinese novel by taking some absurd creative liberties along the way. While previous games in the series have typically covered the bulk of the Three Kingdoms period from 184 AD to 280 AD, Origins tightly focuses on the early parts of the story, beginning with the rise of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and culminating in the decisive Battle of Chibi. Unlike the rest of the series, the story is also told from the perspective of an amnesiac warrior who's meeting legendary figures like Guan Yu, Dong Zhuo, and the fearsome Lü Bu for the first time. This setup is clearly designed with newcomers in mind, making the series' enduring legacy and myriad beloved characters much more palatable for new players to dive into for the first time.Still, that doesn't mean returning players will be left wanting. By focusing on the early events of the Three Kingdoms' tapestry, Omega Force has opted to delve into the time period in greater detail than before, with a renewed emphasis on storytelling and character development. Even minor figures are more fleshed out, while pivotal moments are given the gravitas they deserve. This is somewhat of a double-edged sword, however. The writing is generally solid, with defined, charming, and likable characters engaging in moral quandaries and battles of both wit and brawn, but the overabundance of cutscenes sometimes works to its detriment. Too many conversations simply feel derivative, either repeating plot points or adding little of substance to the narrative and your understanding of its ensemble cast of characters. This disrupts the game's pacing, leading to more than a few occasions where you're forced to wait impatiently for the next battle to arrive as you cycle through one superfluous conversation after another.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US splits world into three tiers for AI chip access</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 16:18:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday, the US government announced a new round of regulations on global AI chip exports, dividing the world into roughly three tiers of access. The rules create quotas for about 120 countries and allow unrestricted access for 18 close US allies while maintaining existing bans on China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.AI-accelerating GPU chips, like those manufactured by Nvidia, currently serve as the backbone for a wide variety of AI model deployments, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, AI video generators, self-driving cars, weapons targeting systems, and much more. The Biden administration fears that those chips could be used to undermine US national security.According to the White House, "In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>FTC Chair Lina Khan’s Exit Interview: Challenging AI, Big Tech and More | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enHn9R_T2R8</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 15:00:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan sat down with WSJ’s Damian Paletta on the final days of her post as FTC chair to reflect on a historically aggressive tenure at the head of the FTC – and what the future could look like for antitrust enforcement.

Legal Skirmish Continues</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/01/13/0323229/oracle-wont-withdraw-javascript-trademark-says-deno-legal-skirmish-continues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Oracle has informed us they won't voluntarily withdraw their trademark on 'JavaScript'." That's the word coming from the company behind Deno, the alternative JavaScript/TypeScript/WebAssembly runtime, which is pursuing a formal cancellation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

So what happens next? Oracle "will file their Answer, and we'll start discovery to show how 'JavaScript' is widely recognized as a generic term and not controlled by Oracle." Deno's social media posts show a schedule of various court dates that extend through July of 2026, so "The dispute between Oracle and Deno Land could go on for quite a while," reports InfoWorld:
Deno Land co-founder Ryan Dahl, creator of both the Deno and Node.js runtimes, said a formal answer from Oracle is expected before February 3, unless Oracle extends the deadline again. "After that, we will begin the process of discovery, which is where the real legal work begins. It will be interesting to see how Oracle argues against our claims — genericide, fraud on the USPTO, and non-use of the mark." 

The legal process begins with a discovery conference by March 5, with discovery closing by September 1, followed by pretrial disclosure from October 16 to December 15. An optional request for an oral hearing is due by July 8, 2026. 

Oracle took ownership of JavaScript's trademark in 2009 when it purchased Sun Microsystems, InfoWorld notes. 

But "Oracle does not control (and has never controlled) any aspect of the specification or how the phrase 'JavaScript' can be used by others," argues an official petition filed by Deno Land Inc. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:
Today, millions of companies, universities, academics, and programmers, including Petitioner, use "JavaScript" daily without any involvement with Oracle. The phrase "JavaScript" does not belong to one corporation. It belongs to the public. JavaScript is the generic name for one of the bedrock languages of modern programming, and, therefore, the Registered Mark must be canceled. 

An open letter to Oracle discussing the genericness of the phrase "JavaScript," published at https://javascript.tm/, was signed by 14,000+ individuals at the time of this Petition to Cancel, including notable figures such as Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, and the current editors of the JavaScript specification, Michael Ficarra and Shu-yu Guo. There is broad industry and public consensus that the term "JavaScript" is generic. 

The seven-page petition goes into great detail, reports InfoWorld. "Deno Land also accused Oracle of committing fraud in its trademark renewal efforts in 2019 by submitting screen captures of the website of JavaScript runtime Node.js, even though Node.js was not affiliated with Oracle."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘Why Did I Survive?’: Altadena Residents Return Home Amid L.A.

"You've heard it all before. But now there's a Linux-powered PC that many people will want..." 

He's talking about Nvidia's newly-announced Project Digits, describing it as "a desktop with AI supercomputer power that runs DGX OS, a customized Ubuntu Linux 22.04 distro."

Powered by MediaTek and Nvidia's Grace Blackwell Superchip, Project DIGITS is a $3,000 personal AI that combines Nvidia's Blackwell GPU with a 20-core Grace CPU built on the Arm architecture... At CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed plans to make this technology available to everyone, not just AI developers. "We're going to make this a mainstream product," Huang said. His statement suggests that Nvidia and MediaTek are positioning themselves to challenge established players — including Intel and AMD — in the desktop CPU market. This move to the desktop and perhaps even laptops has been coming for a while. As early as 2023, Nvidia was hinting that a consumer desktop chip would be in its future... [W]hy not use native Linux as the primary operating system on this new chip family? 

Linux, after all, already runs on the Grace Blackwell Superchip. Windows doesn't. It's that simple. Nowadays, Linux runs well with Nvidia chips. Recent benchmarks show that open-source Linux graphic drivers work with Nvidia GPUs as well as its proprietary drivers. Even Linus Torvalds thinks Nvidia has gotten its open-source and Linux act together. In August 2023, Torvalds said, "Nvidia got much more involved in the kernel. Nvidia went from being on my list of companies who are not good to my list of companies who are doing really good work." Canonical, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, has long worked closely with Nvidia. Ubuntu already provides Blackwell drivers.
 
The article strays into speculation, when it adds "maybe you wouldn't pay three grand for a Project DIGITS PC. But what about a $1,000 Blackwell PC from Acer, Asus, or Lenovo? All three of these companies are already selling MediaTek-powered Chromebooks...." 

"The first consumer products featuring this technology are expected to hit the market later this year. I'm looking forward to running Linux on it. Come on in! The operating system's fine."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Roald Amundsen</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/roald-amundsen</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 23:05:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Lives Matter Rally (Dear Kelly Scene)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmc5-B5AFpk</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 20:10:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[DEAR KELLY will premiere in three days at 5:55 P.M.

Is there any benefit to migrating this codebase to a more modern PHP framework, like Laravel? And is there an easy and minimally intrusive way this can be done en-masse, across dozens of applications and websites? 

Or at this point should I just stick with vi?

ABSTRACT
In his book, Agile Design Patterns, Robert C. Martin introduces the #SOLID #DesignPrincipals as cornerstones for the construction of software that amenable to change.

Part of a larger set of design principals1, the SOLID principals are closely associated with object oriented languages like C++, Java, C#, and more recently Ruby. And although they span different eras, all these languages share the same class structured, inheritance based foundations.

#Go is one of a set of new languages that eschew inheritance, instead preferring the mantra of composition. Does this mean that Go programs do not follow the SOLID design principals, or even that Go is not an object oriented language?

In this talk I will explore the five core SOLID design patterns, discuss their applicability to Go programmers, and explain that while Go programs are not inheritance or class based, they adhere strongly to Martin’s principals. The audience will learn how well structured Go applications naturally follow the SOLID principals, leading to code which is loosely coupled, highly reusable, and inherently maintainable.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, joined by co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly, dives into the mysterious world of hypnosis with clinical psychiatrist David Spiegel. What is hypnosis? Is it about losing control—or gaining it?

We explore the human mind and consciousness, asking if there’s a “user manual” for our brains. How does hypnosis work? Dr. Spiegel explains how our salience network, which processes external stimuli, can be “turned down,” allowing us to engage deeply with our inner thoughts. Could this altered state offer new perspectives on ourselves and our world?

Some are more hypnotizable than others—why? Is there a genetic component, or can external factors like magnetic stimulation enhance hypnotizability? We discuss the science behind these questions and how hypnosis differs from meditation. Think of meditation as a vitamin and hypnosis as an antibiotic—targeted and potent, especially for managing pain and breaking bad habits. Could hypnosis be used for evil as well as for good? 

From recovering memories to treating phantom limb pain, hypnosis reveals its potential—and limitations. Dr. Spiegel shares the risks of implanted memories and debunks myths about control and resistance. We explore real-world applications like overcoming phobias and addictions as well as enhancing athletic performance. Plus, we discuss the potential for self-hypnosis to revolutionize medicine.

Theoretically, Abraham Lincoln could have read about AI takeover during his lifetime.On June 13, 1863, a letter published in The Press newspaper of Christchurch warned about the potential dangers of mechanical evolution and called for the destruction of machines, foreshadowing the development of what we now call artificial intelligence—and the backlash against it from people who fear it may threaten humanity with extinction. It presented what may be the first published argument for stopping technological progress to prevent machines from dominating humanity.Titled "Darwin among the Machines," the letter recently popped up again on social media thanks to Peter Wildeford of the . The author of the letter, Samuel Butler, submitted it under the pseudonym Cellarius, but later came to publicly embrace his position. The letter drew direct parallels between Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and the rapid development of machinery, suggesting that machines could evolve consciousness and eventually supplant humans as Earth's dominant species.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Main character syndrome?

Recently I ran a terminal survey and I asked people what frustrated
them. One person commented:There are so many pieces to having a modern terminal experience. I wish it
all came out of the box.My immediate reaction was “oh, getting a modern terminal experience isn’t that
hard, you just need to….”, but the more I thought about it, the longer the
“you just need to…” list got, and I kept thinking about more and more
caveats.So I thought I would write down some notes about what it means to me personally
to have a “modern” terminal experience and what I think can make it hard for
people to get there.what is a “modern terminal experience”?Here are a few things that are important to me, with which part of the system
is responsible for them:multiline support for copy and paste: if you paste 3 commands in your shell, it should not immediatly run them all! That’s scary! (, ): if I run a command in my shell, it should be saved forever, not deleted after 500 history entries or whatever. Also I want commands to be saved to the history immediately when I run them, not only when I exit the shell session (): I can’t live without having my  and  in my prompt (): this is important to me because I find it MUCH easier to theme neovim with 24-bit colour support than in a terminal with only 256 colours () between vim and my operating system so that when I copy in Firefox, I can just press  in vim to paste (, maybe the OS/terminal emulator too): for example commands like git should have command-specific autocomplete () (): I spend a lot of time in my terminal, I want it to look nice and I want its theme to match my terminal editor’s theme. (, )automatic terminal fixing: If a programs prints out some weird escape
codes that mess up my terminal, I want that to automatically get reset so
that my terminal doesn’t get messed up (): I want  to work ( or )being able to use the scroll wheel in programs like : ( and )There are a million other terminal conveniences out there and different people
value different things, but those are the ones that I would be really unhappy
without.how I achieve a “modern experience”use the  shell. Mostly don’t configure it, except to:
set the  environment variable to my favourite terminal editoruse any terminal emulator with 24-bit colour support. In the past I’ve used
GNOME Terminal, Terminator, and iTerm, but I’m not picky about this. I don’t really
configure it other than to choose a font.use , with a configuration that I’ve been very slowly building over the last 9 years or so (the last time I deleted my vim config and started from scratch was 9 years ago)A few things that affect my approach:I don’t spend a lot of time SSHed into other machinesI’d rather use the mouse a little than come up with keyboard-based ways to do everythingI work on a lot of small projects, not one big projectsome “out of the box” options for a “modern” experienceWhat if you want a nice experience, but don’t want to spend a lot of time on
configuration? Figuring out how to configure vim in a way that I was satisfied
with really did take me like ten years, which is a long time!My best ideas for how to get a reasonable terminal experience with minimal
config are:terminal emulator: almost anything with 24-bit colour support, for example all of these are popular:
linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator, xfce4-terminalmac: iTerm (Terminal.app doesn’t have 256-colour support)cross-platform: kitty, alacritty, wezterm, or ghosttyshell config:
set the  environment variable to your favourite terminal text
editormaybe alias  to text editor: this is a tough one, maybe micro or helix? I haven’t used
either of them seriously but they both seem like very cool projects and I
think it’s amazing that you can just use all the usual GUI editor commands
( to copy,  to paste,  to select all) in micro and
they do what you’d expect. I would probably try switching to helix except
that retraining my vim muscle memory seems way too hard. Also helix doesn’t
have a GUI or plugin system yet.Personally I  use xterm, rxvt, or Terminal.app as a terminal emulator,
because I’ve found in the past that they’re missing core features (like 24-bit
colour in Terminal.app’s case) that make the terminal harder to use for me.I don’t want to pretend that getting a “modern” terminal experience is easier
than it is though – I think there are two issues that make it hard. Let’s talk
about them!issue 1 with getting to a “modern” experience: the shellbash and zsh are by far the two most popular shells, and neither of them
provide a default experience that I would be happy using out of the box, for
example:you need to customize your promptthey don’t come with git completions by default, you have to set them upby default, bash only stores 500 (!) lines of history and (at least on Mac OS)
zsh is only configured to store 2000 lines, which is still not a lotI find bash’s tab completion very frustrating, if there’s more than
one match then you can’t tab through themAnd even though I love fish, the fact
that it isn’t POSIX does make it hard for a lot of folks to make the switch.Of course it’s totally possible to learn how to customize your prompt in bash
or whatever, and it doesn’t even need to be that complicated (in bash I’d
probably start with something like export PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ ', or maybe use starship).
But each of these “not complicated” things really does add up and it’s
especially tough if you need to keep your config in sync across several
systems.An extremely popular solution to getting a “modern” shell experience is
oh-my-zsh. It seems like a great project and I know a lot
of people use it very happily, but I’ve struggled with configuration systems
like that in the past – it looks like right now the base oh-my-zsh adds about
3000 lines of config, and often I find that having an extra configuration
system makes it harder to debug what’s happening when things go wrong. I
personally have a tendency to use the system to add a lot of extra plugins,
make my system slow, get frustrated that it’s slow, and then delete it
completely and write a new config from scratch.issue 2 with getting to a “modern” experience: the text editorIn the terminal survey I ran recently, the most popular terminal text editors
by far were , , and .I think the main options for terminal text editors are:use vim or emacs and configure it to your liking, you can probably have any
feature you want if you put in the workuse nano and accept that you’re going to have a pretty limited experience
(for example I don’t think you can select text with the mouse and then “cut”
it in nano)use  or  which seem to offer a pretty good out-of-the-box
experience, potentially occasionally run into issues with using a less
mainstream text editorjust avoid using a terminal text editor as much as possible, maybe use VSCode, use
VSCode’s terminal for all your terminal needs, and mostly never edit files in
the terminal. Or I know a lot of people use  as their  in the terminal.issue 3: individual applicationsThe last issue is that sometimes individual programs that I use are kind of
annoying. For example on my Mac OS machine,  doesn’t support
the  keyboard shortcut. Fixing this to get a reasonable
terminal experience in SQLite was a little complicated, I had to:realize why this is happening (Mac OS won’t ship GNU tools, and “Ctrl-Left arrow” support comes from GNU readline)find a workaround (install sqlite from homebrew, which does have readline support)adjust my environment (put Homebrew’s sqlite3 in my PATH)I find that debugging application-specific issues like this is really not easy
and often it doesn’t feel “worth it” – often I’ll end up just dealing with
various minor inconveniences because I don’t want to spend hours investigating
them. The only reason I was even able to figure this one out at all is that
I’ve been spending a huge amount of time thinking about the terminal recently.A big part of having a “modern” experience using terminal programs is just
using newer terminal programs, for example I can’t be bothered to learn a
keyboard shortcut to sort the columns in , but in   I can just click
on a column heading with my mouse to sort it. So I use htop instead! But discovering new more “modern” command line tools isn’t easy (though
I made a list here),
finding ones that I actually like using in practice takes time, and if you’re
SSHed into another machine, they won’t always be there.everything affects everything elseSomething I find tricky about configuring my terminal to make everything “nice”
is that changing one seemingly small thing about my workflow can really affect
everything else. For example right now I don’t use tmux. But if I needed to use
tmux again (for example because I was doing a lot of work SSHed into another
machine), I’d need to think about a few things, like:if I wanted tmux’s copy to synchronize with my system clipboard over
SSH, I’d need to make sure that my terminal emulator has OSC 52 supportif I wanted to use iTerm’s tmux integration (which makes tmux tabs into iTerm
tabs), I’d need to change how I configure colours – right now I set them
with a shell script that I run when my shell starts, but that means the
colours get lost when restoring a tmux session.and probably more things I haven’t thought of. “Using tmux means that I have to
change how I manage my colours” sounds unlikely, but that really did happen to
me and I decided “well, I don’t want to change how I manage colours right now,
so I guess I’m not using that feature!”.It’s also hard to remember which features I’m relying on – for example maybe
my current terminal  have OSC 52 support and because copying from tmux over SSH
has always Just Worked I don’t even realize that that’s something I need, and
then it mysteriously stops working when I switch terminals.Personally even though I think my setup is not  complicated, it’s taken
me 20 years to get to this point! Because terminal config changes are so likely
to have unexpected and hard-to-understand consequences, I’ve found that if I
change a lot of terminal configuration all at once it makes it much harder to
understand what went wrong if there’s a problem, which can be really
disorienting.So I usually prefer to make pretty small changes, and accept that changes can
might take me a REALLY long time to get used to. For example I switched from
using  to eza a year or two ago and
while I like it (because  prints human-readable file sizes by default)
I’m still not quite sure about it. But also sometimes it’s worth it to make a
big change, like I made the switch to fish (from bash) 10 years ago and I’m
very happy I did.getting a “modern” terminal is not that easyTrying to explain how “easy” it is to configure your terminal really just made
me think that it’s kind of hard and that I still sometimes get confused.I’ve found that there’s never one perfect way to configure things in the
terminal that will be compatible with every single other thing. I just need to
try stuff, figure out some kind of locally stable state that works for me, and
accept that if I start using a new tool it might disrupt the system and I might
need to rethink things.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a Keychron Q0 Max macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPk09Ars-JE</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2025 09:01:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q0-max-qmk-custom-number-pad

PowerSchool says its cloud-based student information system is used by 18,000 customers around the globe, including the US and Canada, to handle grading, attendance records, and personal information of more than 60 million K-12 students and teachers. On December 28 someone managed to get into its systems and access their contents "using a compromised credential," the California-based biz told its clients in an email seen by Register this week.
 
[...] "We believe the unauthorized actor extracted two tables within the student information system database," a spokesperson told us. "These tables primarily include contact information with data elements such as name and address information for families and educators. "For a certain subset of the customers, these tables may also include Social Security Number, other personally identifiable information, and limited medical and grade information. "Not all PowerSchool student information system customers were impacted, and we anticipate that only a subset of impacted customers will have notification obligations." While the company has tightened security measures and offered identity protection services to affected individuals, cybersecurity firm Cyble suggests the intrusion "may have been more serious and gone on much longer than has been publicly acknowledged so far," reports The Register. The cybersecurity vendor says the intrusion could have occurred as far back as June 16, 2011, with it ending on January 2 of this year.
 
"Critical systems and applications such as Oracle Netsuite ERP, HR software UltiPro, Zoom, Slack, Jira, GitLab, and sensitive credentials for platforms like Microsoft login, LogMeIn, Windows AD Azure, and BeyondTrust" may have been compromised, too.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It&apos;s a peccadillo circus (Friends)</title><link>https://changelog.com/friends/75</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mat Ryer is back!

But the report's broader analysis paints a far more nuanced picture than CNN's headline suggests: It finds that AI could create 170 million new jobs globally while eliminating 92 million positions, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs by 2030."Half of employers plan to re-orient their business in response to AI," writes the WEF in the report. "Two-thirds plan to hire talent with specific AI skills, while 40% anticipate reducing their workforce where AI can automate tasks."The survey collected data from 1,000 companies that employ 14 million workers globally.

Trump says the U.S. needs the island for “national security purposes,” but Greenland has been tied both politically and culturally with Denmark for decades. The Arctic island has vast deposits in rare earths, oil and gas, also making it a focal point for other rivals including China and Russia. But can Trump actually purchase the territory from Denmark?

WSJ explores why any U.S. bid for the Danish territory is complicated and controversial.

Back in 2013 a couple random dudes decided to make a pseudo-sequel to Footprints in Stone called Forbidden History: Footprints in Stone II, which is essentially just an extended interview with Carl Baugh and his protegee Aaron Judkins. I was really tempted to call this video Footprints in Stone III, but restrained myself and consigned that in-joke to the clickbait title.

RFK, Jr. has put the decades-old debate over water fluoridation back on the table. As Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, he might be the most powerful public health figure in the US who believes we should take fluoride out of our water. 

The US has been fluoridating public water systems since 1945, when the children of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and three other cities became the first to experience how fluoridated water can fight tooth decay. Ever since, other municipalities have followed suit. Today, 63 percent of Americans drink fluoridated water from their taps. The US is one of 11 countries worldwide where more than half the population has fluoridated water. Some countries opt for fluoridating salt or milk instead. 

Fluoride is essential for our oral health. But there is a growing debate about whether water fluoridation is still necessary now that most toothpaste has fluoride in it. Right now, epidemiologists are looking into whether US water fluoridation doses are safe for developing brains — and how some levels of fluoride in the water may affect child IQ.

The move is part of a raft of promises Trump made to the cryptocurrency community while on the campaign trail. These included the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a promise to immediately fire Gary Gensler, the then chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump’s return to the White House coincides with a massive rally in cryptocurrencies. In December, Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time -- a significant milestone after 16 years of boom and bust. But for the average American, crypto still comes with plenty of risks.

Though there are more fixed and mobile telephone connections, even they use Internet technology in their core. For all the many uses the Internet allows for today, its origins lie in the cold war and the need for a defense communications network that could survive a nuclear strike. But that defense communications network quickly became used for general communications and within only a few years of the first transmission, traffic on the predecessor to today’s Internet was already 75 percent email.Arpanet was the vital precursor of today’s Internet, commissioned by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1969. In his interesting account of why Arpanet came about, Stephen Lukasic, director of DARPA from 1970–75, wrote that if its true nature and impact had been realized it would never have been permitted under the US government structure of the time. The concept for a decentralized communications technology that would survive a nuclear attack would have placed it outside DARPA’s remit (as defense communications specifically were assigned to a different agency), so the focus changed to how to connect computers together so that major applications could be run on the most appropriate system available.This was in the era of time-sharing computers. Today’s familiar world of the ubiquitous “personal computer” on each desk was decades away. Computers of this time were generally very large, filling entire rooms, and comparatively rare. Users working at connected terminals would submit jobs to the computer that would allocate processing time for the job when available. The idea went that if these computers were networked together, an available remote computer could process a job even when the computers closer to the users were full. The resulting network was called Arpanet, and the first packets of data traversed the network in September 1969.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Islam Influenced Black Americans in 1920s Chicago | American Muslims: A History Revealed</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN8bg2UiiVg</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Thu, 9 Jan 2025 17:01:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The 1920s saw a revival in Islam among Black Americans fleeing poverty and persecution in the Jim Crow South. In Northern cities including Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, they found strength and security in a range of Muslim organizations, from the India-based Ahmadiyya movement to the homegrown Moorish Science Temple and Nation of Islam. In this film, host Malika Bilal (Senior Presenter, Al Jazeera English) tells the story of these early Black American Muslim communities through a woman named Florence Watts, who moved to the bustling South Side of Chicago around 1910, where she found work as a cook and a maid. 

Drawing on the work of Sylvia Chan-Malik, (author of Being Muslim: A Cultural History of Women of Color in American Islam,) Malika discovers how Florence was drawn to the teachings of the Ahmadiyya missionary, Mufti Mohammad Sadiq. In 1923, she joined one of the first multi-racial Muslim communities in the country. That same year, Florence was featured in the Ahmadiyya magazine Moslem Sunrise, her image captured in one of the earliest known photographs of a group of Muslim women taken in the United States. Through Florence’s story, Malika discovers how these Muslim groups helped working-class Black Americans resist the confines of race in the United States and feel part of a global community of believers. They in turn helped to create a legacy of Islam that has been embraced by African Americans since.

--

No substance has been as constant an ally to insidious scheming as arsenic, the so-called “king of poisons.” In its chemically pure form, it isn’t much of a threat because our bodies don’t absorb it well; it’s when arsenic combines with other elements that things get dangerous. So, how did this substance become such a popular poison? Neil Bradbury digs into the element's sordid and lethal history.

Overall, I was satisfied with it, despite some strange recent updates like adding AI features, KeyChain integration, and security vulnerabilities.In recent years, new terminal emulators have appeared. I tried using them mainly for testing macmon. A couple of years ago, I tried switching to kitty, which was faster due to GPU acceleration. However, it required too much customization and still looked very non-native for macOS. GPU acceleration was added to iTerm as well, so I stayed with it.I also tried Alacritty, but it is very basic and lacks the features I need. Recently, I tested Ghostty, which has gained huge attention – it has nice defaults, but its RAM usage is concerning (around 250MB per empty tab). Currently, it also lacks buffer search, which makes the terminal useless for me.I heard a lot of positive feedback about WezTerm from bobuk. So I decided to try it out and use it for some time – and I am very satisfied with it.The next part of the article will be about how to make WezTerm understandable for iTerm users to try it or switch completely.WezTerm can be installed from Homebrew:When you first open WezTerm, it looks plain, non-native, and not very functional. But actually, it has everything you need. This is because WezTerm is cross-platform, unlike iTerm2, so the author left minimal default settings, leaving the rest of the configuration to the user. My goal is to achieve a similar experience in WezTerm as I had in iTerm.WezTerm does not have a graphical interface for configuration, and the setup is done through a Lua file (this is unusual for me, but Vim users are familiar with it). The configuration file can be located at  or ~/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua. I prefer the second path because it is where Fish and starship store configs too.Create a configuration file:And then add the boilerplate code for configuration:First, I want to change the default font, its size, and disable ligatures (because it's important to see the actual characters in case of some logs).Save the file, and the changes should be applied immediately (yes, no reload required!).Next, I want to change the theme and set it to follow the current system theme automatically. For the past year, I have been using Catppuccin themes, and I am very happy with them. They rarely have issues where some text colors blend with the background. To make the theme switch automatically based on the current system theme, we need to write a small Lua function (I copied it from the documentation):I forgot to mention that the Catppuccin theme, like many other popular themes, is pre-installed in WezTerm, so you don't need to install it separately like in iTerm, which is very cool. Of course, you can also set up your own colors.The default padding also seems a bit large, so let's make it smaller. I also had a Blinking Line Cursor (I don't remember if this is the default or not in iTerm). Let's set both configurations:In iTerm, I used the Minimal theme to save vertical space for tabs. We can do the same in WezTerm (the default tabs don't look very good). Also possible to add some transparency and blur to the window. I didn't use this in iTerm, but let's try it now:In iTerm, I usually set large values for Cols/Rows to make the start window bigger. This approach is a bit outdated, so let's make the window open in full screen when the terminal starts.Finally, the most important part is setting up hotkeys – it's hard to give up what you've been used to for years. An important thing for me is Split Panels with  / .  should close the current active panel, not the whole tab.  – clear the current screen.  /  for start/end of the line. I think these are all defaults from iTerm, so let's make them the same in WezTerm:WezTerm also has a Command Execution menu. I haven't used it much yet, but just in case, I bind it to the same keys as in VSCode / Zed – .Note: In the configuration, the  value is case-sensitive, so  and  are different things (basically  is the same as ). I initially got confused with this.Overall, I am very satisfied with WezTerm and have fully switched to using it daily. One cool feature I want to mention is the quick connect to servers in Known hosts via SSH (Command Palette → type server name → Enter OR Nav Bar → Shell → Click on server name). WezTerm also has Workspaces – an alternative to tmux, but I haven't used it actively yet.Here a gist with the final config from this article.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Here’s how hucksters are manipulating Google to promote shady Chrome extensions</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/googles-chrome-web-store-has-a-serious-spam-problem-promoting-shady-extensions/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 23:46:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The people overseeing the security of Google’s Chrome browser explicitly forbid third-party extension developers from trying to manipulate how the browser extensions they submit are presented in the Chrome Web Store. The policy specifically calls out search-manipulating techniques such as listing multiple extensions that provide the same experience or plastering extension descriptions with loosely related or unrelated keywords.On Wednesday, security and privacy researcher Wladimir Palant revealed that developers are flagrantly violating those terms in hundreds of extensions currently available for download from Google. As a result, searches for a particular term or terms can return extensions that are unrelated, inferior knockoffs, or carry out abusive tasks such as surreptitiously monetizing web searches, something Google expressly forbids.Not looking? Don’t care? Both?A search Wednesday morning in California for Norton Password Manager, for example, returned not only the official extension but three others, all of which are unrelated at best and potentially abusive at worst.

What sets ancient Rome apart is that many of these celebrities—particularly gladiators, actors, and musicians—were slaves, performing in public arenas to gain fame, sometimes even achieving wealth and freedom.

Explore how Roman emperors, such as Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius, shaped not only the political landscape but also fashion trends and cultural movements. Hadrian, for instance, popularized wearing a beard, which became fashionable for a century after his reign. Roman gladiators, actresses, musicians, and authors, rose to prominence through their performances. Despite being from marginalized backgrounds, their talents made them stars, adored by the public.

For years, the auto industry has been hyping the transition to electric vehicles with optimistic sales forecasts for electric models and huge growth projections. Investors pumped up valuations for automakers, based on their visions for an electric future.

Now the hype is dwindling, and companies are again cheering consumer choice. Automakers from Ford Motor and General Motors to Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo are scaling back or delaying their electric vehicle plans.

Tesla’s annual vehicle deliveries declined for the first time in more than a decade during a period when overall car sales are up. Have automakers overinvested in EVs and are EVs killing the car industry?

She was every bit a woman of her time, engaging in the overblown sentimentality and culture of death so pervasive during the age that bears her name. When she died at 81, the queen left secret, detailed instructions on how to handle her body and what items to place in her coffin. There are, indeed, a number of strange Queen Victoria death facts worth exploring.

But this did not apply to the armed services until January 2000 – prior to that being queer in the British military was not only illegal but would have resulted in a possible jail term and instant dismissal. Lee Arnott has studied the gay experience within the military between 1969 and the present day. In this video, we look at why it took so long for the British military to lift the ban.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Note: This post is based on my research and may differ from real-world implementation.Once upon a time, there was a sports journalist named Maria.She had to travel often by flight for work.But one day she lost her luggage during a flight, and couldn’t track it. So she was sad and upset.She hears about a tracking device, called Apple AirTag, from a coworker.And bought it immediately, she was dazzled by its simplicity in tracking luggage.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re also on Bluesky:An AirTag contains a low-power CPU and a tiny amount of memory.A tracking device must send its accurate location data at regular intervals.Yet finding location data using GPS, WiFI, or cellular networks consumes power. Besides it’s expensive to maintain a tracking device with GPS functionality.So smart engineers at Apple used simple ideas to solve this hard problem.An AirTag doesn’t use GPS, WiFi, or a cellular network for communication; instead, it uses Bluetooth Low Energy ().Imagine BLE as a low-power wireless technology for communication.The key pair is shared between AirTag and the user account. The AirTag sends location data after encrypting it using the public key. While the user account decrypts the received location data using the private key.Think of the  as an email address; anyone can send messages to it. While the  is similar to the password of an inbox; only the user with the password can read emails.And authenticity of an email can be verified by checking the sender’s email address: .2. Broadcasting AirTag’s LocationThey send the AirTag’s location, which is near its owner’s iPhone, using Bluetooth, or Ultra Wideband for precision and efficiency.Think of  as a wireless technology for high-speed, and short-range communication.Yet Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband communication won’t work if the owner’s iPhone is far from the AirTag. So they rely on someone else's iPhone which is nearby.The AirTag broadcasts its public key every 2 seconds over BLE.Someone else’s iPhone, which is nearby, receives the broadcast signal. The iPhone encrypts its location data and timestamp using the received public key.The iPhone uploads the encrypted data to the Apple server over HTTP.Put simply, AirTag doesn’t send location data; instead, only the public key. The iPhone then includes its location data and encrypts it.3. Finding AirTag’s LocationThe owner can find AirTag’s location using their iPhone app.The owner authenticates on the Apple server.The owner requests location data for a specific public key.The owner decrypts the received location data using their private key.The iPhone then displays AirTag’s recent location on a map.An iPhone is necessary to relay location data, so an AirTag won’t work if there aren’t any iPhones nearby.Put simply, the precision and effectiveness of an AirTag depends on the number of iPhones in its proximity.While there are around 1.46 billion iPhone users in the world.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in February 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

Analysis of the coffee consumption of more than 40,000 adults found that morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease during a 10-year follow-up period than those who went without. But the benefits to heart health appeared to vanish in people who drank coffee throughout the day, the researchers found, with medical records showing no significant reduction in mortality for all-day drinkers compared with those who avoided coffee. [...]
 
The study suggests that a morning dose of coffee is better for the heart than an evening one, but it does not explain why. One possible explanation is that drinking coffee later in the day can disrupt circadian rhythms and levels of hormones such as melatonin. This in turn affects sleep, inflammation and blood pressure, all of which can harm heart health. In an accompanying editorial, Prof Thomas Luscher, a consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals in London, notes that many all-day drinkers sleep poorly, adding that coffee seems to suppress melatonin, a hormone that is important for inducing sleep in the brain. The effects are driven largely by caffeine, but coffee contains hundreds of other bioactive compounds that affect our physiology. The researchers say some substances in the blood that drive inflammation often peak in the morning and could be countered by anti-inflammatory compounds in a morning coffee. "This explanation applies to both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee," they write. "Overall, we must accept the now substantial evidence that coffee drinking, particularly in the morning hours, is likely to be healthy," Luscher writes. "Thus, drink your coffee, but do so in the morning!"
 
The study has been published in the European Heart Journal.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Game Emulation on the Carbon Engine with Dimitris “MVG” Giannakis</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/01/08/game-emulation-on-the-carbon-engine-with-dimitris-mvg-giannakis/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=game-emulation-on-the-carbon-engine-with-dimitris-mvg-giannakis</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Wed, 8 Jan 2025 10:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Video game emulation is the process of using software to replicate the functionality of gaming hardware.

Our family made eight $1 million donations to nonprofit groups working to support those most currently in need:Team Rubicon – Mobilizing veterans to continue their service, leveraging their skills and experience to help Americans prepare, respond, and recover from natural disasters.Children's Hunger Fund – Provides resources to local churches in the United States and around the world to meet the needs of impoverished community members.PEN America – Defends writers against censorship and abuse, supports writers in need of emergency assistance, and amplifies the writing of incarcerated prisoners. (One of my personal favorites; I've seen the power of writing transform our world many times.)The Trevor Project – Working to change hearts, minds, and laws to support the lives of young adults seeking acceptance as fellow Americans.First Generation Investors –Introduces high school students in low-income areas to the fundamentals of investing, providing them real money to invest, encouraging long-term wealth accumulation and financial literacy among underserved youth.Global Refuge – Supporting migrants and refugees from around the globe, in partnership with community-based legal and social service providers nationwide, helping rebuild lives in America.Planned Parenthood – Provides essential healthcare services and resources that help individuals and families lead healthier lives.I encourage every American to contribute soon, however you can, to organizations you feel are those most currently in need here in America.We must alsowork toward deeper changes that will take decades to achieve. Over the next five years, my family pledges half our remaining wealth towards long term efforts ensuring that all Americans continue to have access to the American Dream. I never thought my family would be able to do this. My parents are of hardscrabble rural West Virginia and rural North Carolina origins. They barely managed to claw their way to the bottom of the middle class by the time they ended up in Virginia. Unfortunately, due to the demons passed on to them by their parents, my father was an alcoholic and my mother participated in the drinking. She ended up divorcing my father when I was 16 years old. It was only after the divorce that my parents were able to heal themselves, heal their only child, and stop the drinking, which was so destructive to our family. If the divorce hadn't forced the issue, alcohol would have inevitably destroyed us all. My parents may not have done everything right, but they both unconditionally loved me. They taught me how to fully, deeply receive love, and the profound joy of reflecting that love upon everyone around you. I went on to attend public school in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1992 I graduated from the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson.During college, I worked at Safeway as a part-time cashier, earning the federal minimum wage, scraping together whatever money I could through government Pell grants, scholarships, and other part-time work to pay my college tuition. Even with lower in-state tuition, it was rocky. Sometimes I could barely manage tuition payments. And that was in 1992, when tuition was only $3,000 per year. It is now $23,000 per year. College tuition at a state school increased by 8 times over the last 30 years. These huge cost increases for healthcare, education, and housing are not compatible with the American Dream.Programmers all over the world helped make an American Dream happen in 2008 when we built Stack Overflow, a Q&A website for programmers creating a shared Creative Commons knowledge base for the world. We did it democratically, because that's the American way. We voted to rank questions and answers, and held elections for community moderators using ranked choice voting. We built a  – of the programmers, by the programmers, for the programmers. It worked. With the guidance of my co-founder Joel Spolsky, I came to understand that the digital democracy of Stack Overflow was not enough. We must be brave enough to actively, openly share love with each other. That became the foundation for Discourse, a free, open source tool for constructive, empathetic community discussions that are also Creative Commons. We can disagree in those discussions because Discourse empowers communities to set boundaries the community agrees on, providing tools to democratically govern and strongly moderate by enforcing these boundaries. Digital democracy , for everyone.In order for digital democracy to work, we need to see each other through our screens.I've always felt Stack Overflow and Discourse are projects for the public good that happen to be corporations. I probably couldn't have accomplished this in any other country, and I was rewarded handsomely for a combination of hard work and good luck. That's what the American Dream promises us. I recently attended a theater performance of The Outsiders at my son's public high school. All I really knew was the famous "stay gold" line from the 1983 movie adaptation. But as I sat there in the audience among my neighbors, watching the complete story acted out in front of me by these teenagers, I slowly realized what staying gold actually meant:  the American Dream. In the printed program, the director wrote:This play is a reminder that strength lies not just in overcoming hardships but in staying true to ourselves and lifting up those around us. We hope you feel the raw emotions, sense the camaraderie, and connect with the enduring themes of resilience, empathy, and unity. Whether you've read this story recently, long ago, or not at all, I hope you are able to find inspiration in the strength and passion of youth. Thank you for being part of this journey with us.Stay gold.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.But the American Dream is not always available to every American. Its meaning can be distorted. Jimi Hendrix captured this distortion so eloquently in his rendition of our national anthem. We are still trying to live up to those ideals today. In November 2024, enough of us voted for people who interpret the dream in a way that I don't understand.I think many of the Americans who did vote are telling us they no longer believe our government is effectively keeping America fair for everyone. Our status as the world's leading democracy is in question. We should make it easier for more eligible Americans to vote, such as  so all votes carry more weight. We should also strengthen institutions keeping democracy fair for everyone, such as state and local election boards, as well as the Federal Election Commission.It was only after I attained the dream that I was able to fully see how many Americans have so very little. This much wealth starts to unintentionally distance my family from other Americans. I no longer bother to look at how much items cost, because . We don't have to think about all these things that are challenging or unreachable for so many others. The more wealth you attain, the more unmistakably clear it becomes how unequal life is for so many of us.Even with the wealth I have, I can't imagine what it would feel like to be a billionaireIt is, for lack of a better word, In 2012, the top 1% of Americans held 24% of our country's wealth. By 2021, the top 1% of Americans held 30%.  So many have so little, while a tiny few have massive, wildly disproportionate wealth, which keeps growing. Now the global top 1% hold nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of the world combined.I grew up poor in America, inspired by the promise of the American Dream that I could better myself and my family by building things that :Work is service, not gain. The object of work is life, not income. The reward of production is plenty, not private fortune. We should measure the prosperity of a nation not by the number of millionaires, but by the absence of poverty, the prevalence of health, the efficiency of the public schools, and the number of people who can and do read worthwhile booksMore than 99% of my wealth will go to philanthropy during my lifetime or at death.I admire Buffett, but even having only a tiny fraction of his $325 billion fortune, to me this pledge was incomplete. When would this wealth be transferred? November 5th raised the stakes. It is now time to allocate  I was so fortunate to be dealt within the next five years not just for my own family, but for all my fellow Americans. Our government seems to be slower and slower at delivering change due to the increased polarization of our two party system. The last meaningful constitutional amendment we've managed to pass in the last 60 years was the 26th amendment in 1971, lowering the voting age to 18 and giving more people a voice in our democracy. I've always loved the ideals behind the American Dream, though we continually struggle to live up to them. They are worth fighting for, even if it means making "good trouble". We must come together and believe in our shared American Dream so deeply that we can improve our democracy... but which dream?The American Dream contains the path of hate, and the path of love. Throughout our history, one hand is always fighting the other. Which path are we choosing?Our family pledges half our remaining wealth toward an American Dream founded on love.Here are some starting points for longer term efforts:We can support organizations making it easier for Americans to vote for a new Congress in two years and a new president in four years. My concern is damage to our democratic institutions may happen so quickly that our votes could matter even less within the coming years.We could found a new organization loosely based on the original RAND Corporation, but modernized like Lever for Change. We can empower the best and brightest to determine a realistic, achievable path toward preserving the American Dream for  working within the current system or outside it.We can start with change in our local communities. Vote in your own city, county, and state elections. Support local independent journalism and media. Find a local organization doing work you admire, ask what they need, and help them meet those needs. Listen to the stories of fellow volunteers, listen to the stories of the people you’re serving – that is the heart of Democracy.We've already completed the eight $1 million donations listed above to help those most immediately in need. Within the next five years, half of our family wealth will support longer term efforts. There is no single solution, so let's work together. I will gladly advise and working towards the same goal.Please join us in Sharing the American Dream:Support organizations you feel are effectively helping those most in need across America right now.Within the next five years, also contribute public dedications of time or funds towards longer term efforts to keep the American Dream fair and attainable for all our children.(I could not have done this without the support of my partner Betsy Burton and the rest of my family. I'd also like to thank Steve McConnell, whose writing inspired me to start this blog in 2004. So many people from all walks of life generously shared their feedback to improve this post. We wrote it together.

He added, "We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies."Both statements are notable coming from Altman, who has served as the leader of OpenAI during the rise of mainstream generative AI products such as ChatGPT. AI agents are the latest marketing trend in AI, allowing AI models to take action on a user's behalf.

He makes the case for Northeastern to reconsider its decision to move from Racket to Python and Java later this year in an overhaul of its first-year curriculum. 

"Students will get extensive training in Python, which is currently the most requested language by co-op employers," Northeastern explains (some two decades after a Slashdot commenter made the same Hot Languages = Jobs observation in a spirited 2001 debate on Java as a CS introductory language)... 

"I have often heard computer science students complain that Fundies 1 teaches Racket instead of a 'useful language' like Python," Kaplan writes. "But the point of Fundies is not to teach Racket — it is to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language. Racket is just the tool it uses to do so. A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language. And with how fast the tech industry changes, is it really worth having a course that teaches just Python when tomorrow, some other language might dominate the industry? Our current curriculum focuses on timeless principles rather than fleeting trends." Also expressing concerns about the selection of suitable languages for novice programming is King's College CS Prof Michael Kölling, who explains, "One of the drivers is the perceived usefulness of the language in a real-world context. Students (and their parents) often have opinions which language is 'better' to learn. In forming these opinions, the definition of 'better' can often be vague and driven by limited insight. One strong aspect commonly cited is the perceived usefulness of a language in the 'real world.' If a language is widely used in industry, it is more likely to be seen as a useful language to learn." Kölling's recommendation? "We need a new language for teaching novices at secondary school and introductory university level," Kölling concludes. "This language should be designed explicitly for teaching [...] Maintenance and adaptation of this language should be driven by pedagogical considerations, not by industry needs." While noble in intent, one suspects Kaplan and Kölling may be on a quixotic quest in a money wins world, outgunned by the demands, resources, and influence of tech giants like Amazon — the top employer of Northeastern MSCS program grads — who pushed back against NSF advice to deemphasize Java in high school CS and dropped $15 million to have tech-backed nonprofit Code.org develop and push a new Java-based, powered-by-AWS CS curriculum into high schools with the support of a consortium of politicians, educators, and tech companies. Echoing Northeastern, an Amazon press release argued the new Java-based curriculum "best prepares students for the next step in their education and careers."

 In November the Steam Survey reflected a 2.03% marketshare for Linux... Roughly inline with what we have been seeing for Linux right at around the 2% threshold. With the just-published December survey numbers, there is a 0.29% increase to 2.29%...! When looking at the Linux numbers, SteamOS Holo accounts for around 36% of all Linux gamers... SteamOS Holo being the operating system of the Steam Deck and beginning to appear on other devices as well... Driven in large part by the Steam Deck relying on a custom AMD SoC/APU and AMD being popular with Linux gamers/enthusiasts for their open-source driver support, AMD CPU use on Linux commands a 73.6% marketshare. 

 In fact, December "saw AMD reach another record-high share among participants of Valve's survey," according to TechSpot — "up 3.02% last month, taking its total to 38.7% as Intel fell slightly to 63.4%..."
Elsewhere, Windows 11 is now comfortably the most popular OS in the survey. It pulled ahead another 2% to an almost 55% share in December as Windows 10 dropped to 42.3%... However, it's a different story when looking at global users: Windows 10's share has increased two months in a row to 62.7% while Windows 11 has declined to 34.1%.
Rounding up the rest of the survey, 16GB of RAM remains the most popular amount of system RAM but it's lead is declining as second-place 32GB grows; a trend that is mirrored in the VRAM category... 

Phoronix adds that the Windows percent "pulled back by 0.51% to 96.1% while Apple macOS also gained 0.22% going up to a 1.61% marketshare."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>All Of The Ways The Ocean Can Kill You</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCcycbWnNlU</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sun, 5 Jan 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The ocean.

Soundwaves: The Symphony of Physics 
Sound is one of the most vivid ways we interact with the underlying science of the universe. A sound can make us laugh, cry or cower in fear, but it can also help us understand our world, how it works and what it's made of. Sound is something we all take for granted, but, in fact, when you hear something you're listening to the sound of pure physics. In this engrossing two-part series Helen Czerski goes on a spectacular journey into the world of sound to discover what it is and what it reveals about the fundamental forces of nature.

With over 3,000 problems, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lost.Which problems should you solve? How many problems are enough for coding interviews?How much time should you spend on each problem?I will answer these questions and more in this article to make your journey smoother, and lot less less painful.For context - I’ve solved more than 1,500 LeetCode problems and cleared interviews at multiple big tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft and in this article I’ll share everything I’ve learned to help you start and navigate LeetCode more effectively.I’ll share practical tips and resources to help you save time, stay focused and build your problem-solving skills without feeling overwhelmed.Why do you even need LeetCode?You might be wondering: why is everyone doing LeetCode questions. Is it really necessary to land a Software Engineering job?The short answer is: .There are plenty of startups and smaller companies that focus more on your experience with specific tech stacks and the projects you’ve built. They might not even include LeetCode style questions in their interview process.But if your goal is to work at big tech companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, you would need to practice LeetCode style questions since that’s what they ask in their interviews.Which programming language to choose?This is a question I get asked all the time.Many people get stuck at deciding which programming language to use.But here’s the truth: It doesn’t really matter. A programming language is just a tool. Once you understand the approach to solving a problem, you can implement it in any language.In my experience giving interviews, unless the job specifically requires expertise in a certain language, you’ll be fine using any language you’re comfortable with.The point is, LeetCode isn’t about syntax. It’s about using the right data structures, algorithms, and your ability to think critically and solve problems.That said, if you’re new to coding, I recommend starting with  It’s beginner-friendly and has a simpler syntax.If you already know a language—stick with it. Whether it’s C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript or Go, there’s no need to switch.You don’t need to be an expert in your chosen language, but you should know the basics like:and input/output operationsBeyond the basics, spend some time learning the  for common data structures and algorithms.These libraries save time and let you focus on solving the problem rather than reimplementing data structures from scratch.Python has lists, dictionaries, and sets.Java has ArrayList, HashMap, and PriorityQueue.C++ offers the STL library with vector, map, and set.Before diving into LeetCode problems, it’s good to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms.Basic Data Structures like Arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.and Fundamental Algorithms like Sorting techniques, binary search, and recursion.Recursion is particularly important, since many problems specially tree and graph related ones rely heavily on it.When you’re familiar with these topics, it becomes much easier to recognize which concept applies to a specific problem.You don’t need to dive too deeply into every topic upfront. Most of your understanding will develop naturally as you solve problems.There are plenty of resources available online to help you get started. Don’t waste time searching for the “perfect” resource—pick one and start learning.The focus should always be on progress, not perfection.Here are some resources I personally found quite useful: It’s my second channel where I upload animated tutorials on DSA and LeetCode patterns.Here’s a comprehensive list of DSA topics you should know for coding interviews:Learn one topic at a timeIf you’re a beginner, focus on one topic at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.For example: Start with , the move to , then progress to more complex topics like , , and .This approach helps you develop a deeper understanding of each topic and teaches you how to recognize when to use a particular data structure or algorithm.Once you’ve learned the basics of a topic and understand how to implement it from scratch, it’s time to put your knowledge to the test.Solve 4-5 easy problems related to that topic on LeetCode.and Build confidence in applying the concepts.If you want to learn more about how to master a DSA topic, you can check out this article where I discuss it in more detail:Which problems should you solve?If you open LeetCode, there are over That number alone can feel overwhelming. So, how do you decide which ones to solve?Start with  for each topic. These are perfect for building confidence and understanding the basics of problem-solving.Once you’re comfortable with the easy ones, gradually challenge yourself with slightly harder problems that push you beyond your comfort zone.Remember, real growth happens when you constantly Don’t worry about hard problems in the beginning.Most coding interviews focus on , so that’s where you should spend the majority of your time.These lists are excellent, and I highly recommend solving every problem on them.How many problems should you solve?There’s no magic number, but from my experience,  is the sweet spot.However, it’s not about solving just any 300 problems. Focus on  that cover the most topics and patterns.To make it easier for you, I’ve created a : a curated list of the Top 300 LeetCode Problems organized into that are most commonly asked in coding interviews.You can find it on  Just head to the practice page. You will see a structured list  that you can follow from top to bottom.Resources to help you learn the topics.Ability to track your progress and mark problems for future revision.Links to GitHub and YouTube solutions.and ability to filter problems based on pattern, difficulty level and status.Don’t rush through problems just to increase your count. Instead of focusing on the quantity of problems you solve, focus on what you learn from each problem.It’s far better to deeply understand and solve 50 problems than to superficially solve 500 problems.After solving a problem, ask yourself:Why does this solution work?What’s the one key insight that made everything else easier?Also, try to make it fun. There is a fun in learning to solve coding challenges. It’s not just about getting a job.Focus on learning PatternsThe key to getting better at LeetCode is learningas manypatterns as possible.Instead of focusing on individual questions, focus on identifying  that connect similar problems.On LeetCode, you’ll come across multiple problems that follow a similar patterns. Once you solve one of them, you can apply the same approach to solve others.For example: After learning the monotonic stack , I was able to solve over 10 similar problems.I made a  covering the 15 most important LeetCode patterns I learned after solving over 1,500 problems. You can check it out later.On , I’ve categorized problems by pattern. This makes it easy to focus on one pattern at a time. By going through the list, you will get to know all the important patterns for coding interviews.How to approach a new problem?1. Read the Problem Statement TwiceThe first time, focus on getting the big picture. What is the problem asking you to do?On the second read, pay attention to specific constraints and conditions. These small details often provide clues for optimizing your solution.2. Analyze the Input and Output ExamplesCarefully go through the examples provided in the problem.Walk through the input and output step by step to understand how the problem works. I have found that, many times simply walking through a few examples helped me figure out the solution.3. Visualize with pen and paperMany problems specially the ones related to trees and graphs are much easier to understand when you draw them out.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios and input sizes. Think about any  that might come up.4. Start with a Brute Force ApproachDon’t expect to come up with the most optimal solution right away.First see, if you can solve the problems using a brute force approach. While it might not be efficient, it gives you a baseline to improve upon.5. Optimize Your SolutionOnce you have a brute force solution, focus on optimizing it.Here are few things to consider:Leverage Unused Information: Look for details you might have missed. For instance, if the problem states that the array is sorted, consider leveraging this to use binary search or a two-pointer approach.: If certain calculations are repeated multiple times, consider precomputing them. Use techniques like  or  to avoid redundant calculations. Hash tables are widely used in interview questions and should be at the top of your mind.Make Time vs. Space Tradeoffs: Sometimes, using additional memory (e.g., hash tables) can speed up your solution.Data Structure Brainstorm: Run through the popular data structures and try to apply each one to the problem at hand.Avoid overcomplicating your solution. At every stage ask yourself, "Is there a simpler way to do this?". This will not only make your solution easier to understand but it will also reduce the chances of errors during coding.7. Analyze Time and Space ComplexityDevelop the habit of analyzing the time and space complexity of every problem you submit.How much time should you spend on each problem?When you’re just starting out, even  can take a while to solve. That’s completely normal—don’t get discouraged if you can’t come up with a solution right away.Your main goal in the beginning should be to  and understanding the problem deeply. Real progress happens when you take the time to think, make mistakes and refine your approach.But, some problems involve specific tricks or patterns that are hard to figure out unless you’ve seen them before.Spending hours on such problems without progress can be counterproductive.Here’s a good rule of thumb:Give yourself  of focused effort for each problem.If you’re still stuck, it’s okay to look at hints or solutions.Read the official solution and and try to understand the top voted solutions on LeetCode discussion forum.Don’t just move on after viewing the solution. Try to grasp why the solution works.Rewrite the solution from scratch without looking at the code. Writing it yourself helps you internalize the approach and ensures you truly understand it.If you couldn’t solve the problem on your first attempt, mark it for  and revisit it after a few weeks. Revisiting problems helps reinforce your understanding and ensures long-term retention.One of the most common mistakes—one that I made myself—is  to difficult problems and moving on.At first, it might seem like a shortcut, but in reality, it’s a  for three main reasons:You’ll quickly forget memorized solutions. Without understanding the logic behind them, they won’t stick in your memory.Your problem-solving skills won’t improve. Memorization skips the critical thinking process, which is the real value of practicing coding problems.You’ll struggle in interviews. Most interviewers ask variants of problems or follow-up questions, and without a deep understanding, you won’t be able to adapt.Instead of memorizing, focus on understanding the solution, even if it takes hours.Break it down step by step and ask yourself:Why does this approach work?What’s the key insight that simplifies the problem?How can I apply this approach to similar problems?This effort pays off in the long term. The deeper your understanding, the more confident you’ll feel explaining your thought process during interviews.Practice in a timed environmentSolving a problem during an interview is very different from solving it from the comfort of your home.That’s why it’s a good idea to time-box yourself and practice in a timed environment after you have learned the basics and solved 100-150 problems.Simply turn on a timer while practicing and try to complete the problem within that time.For , aim to complete them in For , set a timer for For , allow yourself To take your practice a step further:Try  by simulating past LeetCode contests.It’s okay if you struggle to solve even one problem initially—this is normal. The goal is to gain experience solving problems within a time limit.When I started participating in contests, I could only solve 1-2 problems. But with consistent practice, I improved to solving 3 problems, and eventually, I was able to solve all of them in some contests.Getting good at LeetCode isn’t just about learning new concepts or solving problems—it’s also about retaining that knowledge over time.That’s why you should regularly revisit concepts and problems you’ve already solved, especially the ones you found challenging.Try to solve those problems again without looking at the solution.By practicing consistently and revisiting old problems, you’ll make it much easier to retain what you’ve learned over time.I discuss more about how to effectively revise LeetCode problems in this article, so make sure to check it out: Getting good at LeetCode takes time.Some topics might take weeks or even months to master, and that’s okay. Be patient with yourself and remember: It’s completely normal to feel stuck or frustrated when working on a tough problem or grasping a complex topic.If a problem feels too hard, take a break, then come back to it with a fresh perspective.The more you practice, the better you will get at solving LeetCode problems.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>4 Hours Of Facts About The World Wars</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qU7wOvwJvU</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Sat, 4 Jan 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[00:00:00 - Switzerland and WWII: An Exemplary Neutrality?

Using techniques developed over 2,500 years ago, the team takes on the ultimate challenge of recreating a sarcophagus. Can modern hands replicate ancient ingenuity?

Taken from 'Building the Impossible' (2002).

From the tombs of ancient Egypt to the first submarine, history is littered with brilliant and bizarre design concepts. Building the Impossible challenges a team of experts to recreate mythological ideas and ancient inventions - and make them work. Dr Caroline Baillie (a materials scientist) and Professor Chris Wise (a structural engineer) have to use any available information, be it a single sketch, a historical account or archeological discoveries, to help them. At the end of each film it's the moment of truth. Will it work or has it proved truly impossible!

The technique, detailed in a new paper, requires programmers to use a restricted version of C called "Mini-C" that excludes features like pointer arithmetic. The researchers successfully tested their conversion system on two major code libraries, including the 80,000-line HACL* cryptographic library. Parts of the converted code have already been integrated into Mozilla's NSS and OpenSSH security systems, according to the researchers. Memory safety errors account for 76% of Android vulnerabilities in 2019.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Unexpected History Of Midwives</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk3u_7HfrOU</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Fri, 3 Jan 2025 15:01:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While no two births are quite the same, everyone enters the world the same basic way - someone cries, someone else yells, and a third person tries to remember where the towels are.

Amid this flurry of chaos, there exists an age-old profession - midwifery. You’d think helping parents bring their children into this world would be considered a noble pursuit. But being a midwife has never been simple. They were lauded as heroes in one century, persecuted as witches in the next, and are still given the occasional side-eye today.

In a desperate, last-ditch attempt to turn the tide of the war, Hitler threw his armoured divisions at the thinly spread Allied frontline.

As always he is joined by Keeper of Firearms & Artillery, Jonathan Ferguson who talks him through the history of all the pistols, rifles and machine guns employed in the conflict.

First up is the Webley Revolver Mk VI, first introduced during the stalemate of static and bloody trench warfare in 1915. Designed as a top-break revolver with a double-action mechanism and potential speedloader accessory, the Webley Mk VI was considered to be vastly superior to its predecessor models - its 6 inch barrel also offering improved accuracy. Whilst the official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver, a shortage in production led to many Webley’s returning to front line service in the conflict.

Second is the Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I, the new and improved bolt-action rifle issued to British infantrymen during the latter half of the Second World War. Introduced in 1941, the weapon was built upon the legacy of its earlier models, specifically designed to meet the demands of an ever-changing style of warfare. With a 10-round .303 detachable magazine and robust bolt-action mechanism allowing for rapid cycling, the No.4 Lee Enfield enabled trained riflemen to achieve an impressive rate of fire, a hallmark of British infantry tactics since the First World War.

Third up is Sten, designed by Major Reginald V. Shepherd and Harold J. Turpin and introduced in 1941. A cost-effective replacement for the Thompson, the Sten would prove to be a widely used and effective submachine gun used by British soldiers across multiple theatres of the conflict. Notable for its magazine placement at the side of the gun, the Sten was capable of firing 500-600 rounds per minute.

Last but not least is the Bren Light Machine Gun. Derived from the Czech ZB vz. 26 but adapted to meet British military requirements and replace the old Lewis Gun, the Bren would quickly become a cornerstone of British infantry firepower. The centrepiece of every infantry squad, the Bren’s box magazine was filled with 30 .303 rounds, used in the standard Lee Enfield rifles and also carried by virtually every soldier to ensure the weapon was always supplied with sufficient ammunition.

For years, Jean Béliveau walked from country to country, with the goal of circumnavigating the globe on foot. While few people have the time or desire to walk such extreme lengths, research shows that adding even a modest amount of walking to your daily routine can dramatically improve your health. So, what exactly happens to your body when you increase your step count? Shannon Odell investigates.

The mission put a man on the moon for the very first time, winning the Space Race for the United States.  

The rocket that made it possible was Saturn V. As tall as a 36-story building, it was the most powerful that had ever flown, symbolising American technological dominance during the Cold War. 

And yet, the man who designed it had a dark past. During the Second World War, he had been at the forefront of the Nazi Secret Weapons programme, designing weapons which cost thousands of lives. His name was Werner von Braun.

*Note* The shots used at 3:27 are from the German Science Fiction film “The woman in the moon” (Fritz Lang, 1927) This film - used for illustrative purposes in the video - was a source of inspiration for many early rocket scientists, and it’s technical director Herman Oberth would heavily influence von Braun and his work.

They determine which items are removed to make room for new ones.In this article, we’ll dive into 7 Cache Eviction Strategies explaining what they are, how they work, their pros and cons. provides deep session replays with every detail you need to find and fix a bug. From frontend screens to backend traces, metrics, and logs, all in one place. Debug faster and fix customer problems more easily, so you and your team can stay focused on building great software, not combing through APM data. (LRU) evicts the item that hasn’t been used for the longest time.The idea is simple: if you haven’t accessed an item in a while, it’s less likely to be accessed again soon.: LRU keeps track of when each item in the cache was last accessed. This can be done using various data structures, such as a  or a combination of a  and a .Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, it is moved to the  position in the tracking data structure (e.g., moving it to the front of a list).Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the item isn’t in the cache and the cache has free space, it is added directly.If the cache is full, the  is evicted to make space for the new item.The item that has been accessed least recently (tracked at the beginning of the list) is removed from the cache.Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:: Empty cache.Access  → Cache: [B, C, A] (A becomes recently used)Add → Cache: [C, A, D] (B is evicted as it's the “least recently used”): Easy to understand and widely adopted.: Keeps frequently accessed items in the cache.Optimized for Real-World Usage: Matches many access patterns, such as web browsing and API calls.: Tracking usage order can consume additional memory.: For large caches, maintaining the access order may introduce computational overhead.: Assumes past access patterns will predict future usage, which may not always hold true. (LFU) evicts the item with the lowest access frequency. It assumes that items accessed less frequently in the past are less likely to be accessed in the future.Unlike LRU, which focuses on , LFU emphasizes  of access.: LFU maintains a frequency count for each item in the cache, incrementing the count each time the item is accessed.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, its frequency count is increased.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the cache has available space, the new item is added with an initial frequency count of 1.If the cache is full, the item with the lowest frequency is evicted to make room for the new item. If multiple items share the same lowest frequency, a secondary strategy (like LRU or FIFO) resolves ties.: Remove the item with the smallest frequency count.Consider a cache with a capacity of 3:: Empty cache.Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=1), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), B (freq=1), C (freq=1)]Add  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=1), D (freq=1)] (B is evicted as it has the lowest frequency).Access  → Cache: [A (freq=2), C (freq=2), D (freq=1)]Efficient for Predictable Patterns: Retains frequently accessed data, which is often more relevant.Highly Effective for Popular Data: Works well in scenarios with clear "hot" items.: Requires additional memory to track frequency counts.: Tracking and updating frequency can slow down operations.: May keep items that were frequently accessed in the past but are no longer relevant.3. First In, First Out (FIFO)FIFO evicts the item that was added first, regardless of how often it’s accessed.FIFO operates under the assumption that items added earliest are least likely to be needed as the cache fills up.: When an item is added to the cache, it is placed at the end of the queue.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): No changes are made to the order of items. FIFO does not prioritize recently accessed items.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If there is space in the cache, the new item is added to the end of the queue.If the cache is full, the item at the front of the queue (the oldest item) is evicted to make space for the new item.: The oldest item, which has been in the cache the longest, is removed to make room for the new item.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is evicted because it was added first).Access  → Cache: [B, C, D] (Order remains unchanged).Add  → Cache: [C, D, E] (B is evicted because it was the oldest remaining item).: FIFO is straightforward and requires minimal logic.: No need to track additional metadata like access frequency or recency.: Eviction follows a predictable order.: Items still in frequent use can be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.Suboptimal for Many Use Cases: FIFO is rarely ideal in modern systems where recency and frequency matter.: If old but frequently used items are evicted, the cache loses its utility.4. Random Replacement (RR)RR cache eviction strategy is the simplest of all: when the cache is full, it evicts a random item to make space for a new one.It doesn't track recency, frequency, or insertion order, making it a lightweight approach with minimal computational overhead.This simplicity can sometimes be surprisingly effective, especially in systems with unpredictable or highly dynamic access patterns.: When an item is added to the cache and there is space, it is stored directly. If the requested item exists in the cache, it is served, and no changes are made to the cache. If the item is not in the cache and the cache is full, a random item is removed.: The randomly selected item is removed, and the new item is added to the cache.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Add  → Cache: [B, C, D] (A is randomly evicted).Add  → Cache: [C, E, D] (B is randomly evicted).: No need for metadata like access frequency or recency.: Computational and memory requirements are minimal.Fair for Unpredictable Access Patterns: Avoids bias toward recency or frequency, which can be useful in some scenarios.: A frequently used item might be evicted, reducing cache efficiency.Inefficient for Stable Access Patterns: Doesn’t adapt well when certain items are consistently accessed.High Risk of Poor Cache Hit Rates: Random eviction often leads to suboptimal retention of important items.5. Most Recently Used (MRU) is the opposite of Least Recently Used (LRU). In MRU, the item that was accessed most recently is the first to be evicted when the cache is full.The idea behind MRU is that the most recently accessed item is likely to be a temporary need and won’t be accessed again soon, so evicting it frees up space for potentially more valuable data.: When a new item is added to the cache, it is marked as the most recently used.Cache Hit (Item Found in Cache): When an item is accessed, it is marked as the most recently used.Cache Miss (Item Not Found in Cache):If the cache has available space, the new item is added directly.If the cache is full, the most recently used item is evicted to make room for the new item.: The item that was accessed or added most recently is removed.Let’s assume a cache with a capacity of 3:Access  → Cache: [A, B, C] (C is marked as the most recently used).Add  → Cache: [A, B, D] (C is evicted as it was the most recently used).Access  → Cache: [A, B, D] (B becomes the most recently used).Add  → Cache: [A, D, E] (B is evicted as it was the most recently used).Effective in Specific Scenarios: Retains older data, which might be more valuable in certain workloads.: Requires minimal metadata.Suboptimal for Most Use Cases: MRU assumes recent data is less valuable, which is often untrue for many applications.Poor Hit Rate in Predictable Patterns: Fails in scenarios where recently accessed data is more likely to be reused.: Limited applicability compared to other strategies like LRU or LFU. is a cache eviction strategy where each cached item is assigned a fixed lifespan. Once an item’s lifespan expires, it is automatically removed from the cache, regardless of access patterns or frequency.This ensures that cached data remains fresh and prevents stale data from lingering in the cache indefinitely.: When an item is added to the cache, a TTL value (e.g., 10 seconds) is assigned to it. The expiration time is usually calculated as .Cache Access (Hit or Miss): When an item is accessed, the cache checks its expiration time:If the item is expired, it is removed from the cache, and a cache miss is recorded.If the item is valid, it is served as a cache hit.: Expired items are automatically removed either during periodic cleanup or on access.Let’s assume a cache with a TTL of 5 seconds:Add  with TTL = 5s → Cache: [A (expires in 5s)]Add  with TTL = 10s → Cache: [A (5s), B (10s)]After 6 seconds → Cache: [B (expires in 4s)] (A is evicted because its TTL expired).Add  with TTL = 5s → Cache: [B (4s), C (5s)]If an item is accessed after its TTL expires, it results in a cache miss.TTL is often implemented in caching systems like  or , where you can specify expiration times for each key.: Automatically removes stale data, ensuring only fresh items remain in the cache.: TTL values are easy to assign during cache insertion.: No need to track usage patterns or access frequency.: Stale data is cleared out systematically, avoiding cache bloat.: Items may be evicted prematurely even if they are frequently accessed.: Items that haven’t expired but are still irrelevant occupy cache space.: TTL doesn’t adapt to dynamic workloads or usage patterns.Two-Tiered Caching combines two layers of cache—usually a  (in-memory) and a  (distributed or shared). The local cache serves as the first layer (hot cache), providing ultra-fast access to frequently used data, while the remote cache acts as the second layer (cold cache) for items not found in the local cache but still needed relatively quickly.:Resides on the same server as the application, often in memory (e.g., ,  in the application)..Provides ultra-fast access to frequently accessed data, reducing latency and server load.Examples: In-memory data structures like  or frameworks like .Remote Cache (Second Tier):Shared across multiple servers in the system. Slightly slower due to network overhead but offers larger storage and shared consistency.Used to store data that is not in the local cache but is still frequently needed.Examples: Distributed cache systems like  or .A client request checks the  first.If the data is not found (cache miss), it queries the .If the data is still not found (another cache miss), it retrieves the data from the primary data source (e.g., a database), stores it in both the local and remote caches, and returns it to the client.: Local cache provides near-instantaneous response times for frequent requests.: Remote cache adds scalability and allows data sharing across multiple servers.: Two-tiered caching significantly minimizes calls to the backend database.: If the local cache fails, the remote cache acts as a fallback.: Managing two caches introduces more overhead, including synchronization and consistency issues.: Inconsistent updates between tiers may lead to serving stale data.Increased Latency for Remote Cache Hits: Accessing the second-tier remote cache is slower than the local cache.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.If you want to get more value out of this newsletter or just want to support my work, consider becoming a .I hope you have a lovely day!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Story: Leaving Stripe</title><link>https://corecursive.com/leaving-stripe-with-jon-de-le-motte/</link><author>Adam@corecursive.com (Adam@corecursive.com)</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Thu, 2 Jan 2025 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://corecursive.com/">Podcast - CoRecursive</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What if leaving your dream job was the way to discover your true self?   Jon de la Motte failed his first Stripe interview, but he didn't give up.

Watson, a renowned psychologist, and Rosalie Rayner, his assistant and eventual wife, decided to combine love, science, and a fair bit of cluelessness in an experiment that would go down in history as “The Little Albert Experiment.” The idea was bold, the execution debatable, and the results as ethically murky as a midsummer mud puddle. Thus, in a story one might mistake for the beginning of a Dickensian epic, Little Albert’s fate was sealed.

I mainly write in Rust where I used to write in Go. Overall, the language is more complex than Go and sometimes confusing with the borrow checker, but in general, it is quite convenient to write – I can't say that the speed of writing code significantly decreases compared to other languages – in general, the approaches that need to be used are roughly the same for all languages.crates ecosystem – many libraries available and can be installed in one commandsingle binary file and low memory consumptionability to write applications of various directions (web-app, tui, gui, parsers, etc.)What I don't like about Rust:a large number of sub-dependencies for web projects (any project on axum will contain 200+ dependencies)use of C-binding in "core" libraries like rust-tls (ring) – complicates cross-compilation because you have to maintain a C toolchain as well (fixed through Zig build, but it looks monstrous)It's nice to write various parsers in Rust, and then they can be coolly parallelized (with rayon or tokio), in Go I had a problems with this due to immutable strings and lack of GC control.The main languages remained the same: Python, NodeJS/TypeScript. I also actively used NextJS on several projects, overall I was satisfied – it's faster and easier to write frontends, but it's quite difficult to find problem's solutions sometimes (many Github issues, often they are open, and the comments contain answers that no longer work).The main fail of the year in the NodeJS ecosystem is the update of ESLint from 8 -> 9 – completely incompatible API with all existing plugins, the configuration file became larger and more complex – it's not clear why the authors made this diversion. I also tried Binome as an alternative to ESLint / Prettier, but it's completely different and you need to redo a lot, and not everything you need is available at the moment, I continue to monitor this project.I also tried Zig, but didn't write anything serious. Personally, I didn't understand why this language is needed. At the time I tried it, there was no even package manager yet. Obviously Zig is a competitor to C (not Rust), but C is now much richer in its toolkit and support in other languages. The only thing I can point out is  which can build C projects too and does it with less problems.I want to separately note about use of GPTs in work. I have an opportunity to do business tasks in the format of parsing and analyzing texts. What a couple of years ago was done with a bunch of regex, etc., can now be done through GPT and it works great! I tried using local Llama2, but it would have taken weeks to process my data on M2 chip. I redo the solution to use ChatGPT API and processed the data in a couple of days. It's good that all LLMs support openai-client API in Python, so the code almost didn't need to be rewritten. Among the disadvantages of LLama-like aka local running, I also want to note the lack of support for Function calling (to guarantee to bring the LLM response to the desired structure, in my case). The last time I did something serious was more than six months ago, maybe a lot has changed. I also tested gemma2, the inference speed was impressive, and the quality of the answers was not much worse.As local runners, I used llama.cpp and https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx – the second one uses Mac resources better (checked through macmon), but new models come out a bit slower on it. Some people use ollama, but I didn't understand why, considering that it has an incompatible client with openai-client API and slower performance.Initially, I ran my blog only on Medium, but it's not comfortable to write text there – it's much easier to write and edit in the same editor where I write code (plus my editor has Copilot). Therefore, I decided to move my blog to a static page generator. As an engine, I chose Zola (Rust-based, simple, and fast); I also tried Astro, but it's too big and complex for such a simple task. Overall, Zola is good, but it lacks some filters in templating, not enough flexibility in file structure, and not all popular languages are supported in code highlighting.I left Medium as a fallback for old readers. I also made a cross-post on dev.to, but there are very few views. Medium is disappointed with the lack of the ability to automate cross-posting (they have a deprecated API, but it does not support updating articles and code highlights). Most likely, it's possible to reverse engineer how they save articles through their editor (changes are sent as diffs). Does anyone else need this besides me?Last year I launched several new projects (in chronological order):timewiz.cc (, ) – a tool to find common working hours for distributed teams (an alternative to worldtimebuddy.com, I don't remember exactly why I made my own version). Score: fail.ecloop (, ) – secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation for Apple chips. Mainly an educational project to understand cryptography, SIMD optimizations, etc. Added several standard use cases for finding Bitcoin keys by brute force, but mathematically this is pointless, so as I said earlier, this is more of an interesting educational project (and I wanted to publish a series of articles on cryptography, but didn't have time last year, I hope to do it this year). Some people use this project in hopes of finding something. I also had ideas to add Metal API support – but that takes a lot of time, so I switched to other projects. Score: okay.macmon (, ) – TUI program for monitoring MacOS performance (CPU/GPU/ANE usage, RAM, temps). My first public Rust project, a lot of reverse engineering of how powermetrics in MacOS works, C-bindings. The project is used both by users in TUI mode and by other projects in headless mode (JSON metrics). Score: success.ghstats (, , , ) – a small self-hosted service that collects and saves GitHub repo statistics, has several built-in views and an API to retrieve all statistics. The project started well, but then kind of fizzled out in terms of issues and feature requests, most likely users are satisfied with the current functionality. I would like to add more visualizations, but I haven't had time for that yet. The main thing for now is that the statistics are collected and saved, so something can be done with this in the future. Technically, I like that the service consumes only 10 MB of RAM. Score: okay.ogp (, , ) – a small project for generating OGP articles preview as a service. Used in this blog (you can check by sending this article to your friends in a messenger or social network 😀). Worked with the SVG standard (I thought it was more adequate) and generating PNG from SVG. Score: more of fail.compose-updater (, ) – a project for updating the version of a docker image from CI in a closed infrastructure. I didn't find anything ready to solve this task. There is watchtower, but it's more about keeping up-to-date docker images, rather than updating a specific one, and also I couldn't run it with ECR repos – the author made a super minimalist image in which I couldn't enter through  to debug. The second alternative is umputun/updater, but it's more about running different shell commands through a webhook. I chose Python because I didn't find a Rust crate for Docker API (most likely it exists, I just didn't understand which one is really good). Score: – (I didn't promote the project anywhere, I use it for my own purposes for now).twscrape (, ) – a library for parsing data from X/Twitter. Mainly the project is in maintenance mode, I check its functionality every few months, and there have been no requests for new features.apigen-ts (, ) – a library for generating TypeScript client OpenAPI spec. I continue to use it in my projects; I also see that there are a small number of other users. My relevance has slightly decreased due to the NextJS/TRPC stack, but in other configurations (e.g. FastApi + React), it is still relevant, so use it. Periodically there are requests to fix something or add a feature.I also have several projects that I didn't finish and abandoned. I'll write about them here, maybe someone needs something from this, then I can return to on it. – cross-posting between static blog, Medium, Dev.to, Substack, and collecting joined article statistics. I abandoned the project due to the lack of an API at Medium – the only solution I found was through protocol reverse and session cookie. – a program to walk Bitcoin-like blockchain and compile the final UTXO list. I abandoned it because I couldn't figure out how to effectively create a HashMap-like structure with external memory support to run on computers with small RAM (less than 32GB, LOL). – a program that listens to all incoming messages in Telegram (chats & channels) and saves their history in a separate database with the ability to search through these messages later. I have the first version that just saves messages in json files, but I didn't develop the idea further.I'm not a big tech geek, but I want to say about a few devices which made my life easier:MeLE Fanless Quieter 4C – a small fanless PC for , I use it as a native Linux via SSH for testing various programs and keep some cron jobs on it for data collection. It's cool that it's silent because it has no fan, but it heats up a lot under load. The performance of the N100 chip surprised me – only 2x slower than M2 chip (tested with , single core).Promate HDMI-PD100 – nice cable format to connect a monitor and my Mac. One cable is needed to charge and transmit the video stream. Before that, I used hubs, but it's a big block. I'm glad I see fewer wires.Over the year, 8 articles were published, totaling 9039 words (~45 minutes to read), and gained 5203 views. Top 3 articles:Data aggregated from this site (with umami), Medium, and Dev.to. Script.Public GitHub projects – totaling 312 commits, 49 issues closed, 43 releases created, and 1394 stars gained. Top-3 repos:Data aggregated with .I hope I will see a different top with new projects this year 😀In  repository I was asked to make it possible to send coffee as donations. Over the year I received 38 cups of coffee from 10 people. I spend these coffees on an annual Parallels subscription, which allows me to test some apps on Windows. Also, I partially paid from this fund for MeLE and VPS, which I used to test apps as well. Many thanks for supporting my work!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Were Britain&apos;s Secret Agencies Working Against Each Other In WW2?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVt-LomZkjU</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How did the Nazis penetrate the French Resistance?

With Windows 10 reaching end of support in October 2025, many users will face decisions about upgrading hardware for Windows 11 or considering different operating systems entirely. Linux distributions have evolved to offer increasingly polished desktop experiences, with improving hardware compatibility and familiar user interfaces. 

2024 saw Linux adoption grow thanks to the Steam Deck's success, reaching a 4.04% market share in December, up from 3.85% during the same time last year. More Linux laptops, improved gaming compatibility, and growing awareness of its benefits also contributed to its steady rise.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2249 - Yannis Pappas &amp; Chris Distefano</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbyBSPGsURE</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 18:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This episode is brought to you by The Farmer's Dog.

The research team analyzed 20TB of data from GHArchive, spanning 6 billion GitHub events from 2019 to 2024, using their "StarScout" detection tool. The tool identified 278,000 accounts engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior to artificially boost repository rankings. 

GitHub uses stars, similar to social media likes, to rank projects and recommend content to users. The platform has previously encountered malicious exploitation of this system, including the "Stargazers Ghost Network" malware operation discovered last summer.

One of the most vexing and most common problems is logging into accounts in a way that's both secure and reliable.Using the same password everywhere is easy, but in an age of mass data breaches and precision-orchestrated phishing attacks, it's also highly unadvisable. Then again, creating hundreds of unique passwords, storing them securely, and keeping them out of the hands of phishers and database hackers is hard enough for experts, let alone Uncle Charlie, who got his first smartphone only a few years ago. No wonder this problem never goes away.Passkeys—the much-talked-about password alternative to passwords that have been widely available for almost two years—was supposed to fix all that. When I wrote about passkeys two years ago, I was a big believer. I remain convinced that passkeys mount the steepest hurdle yet for phishers, SIM swappers, database plunderers, and other adversaries trying to hijack accounts. How and why is that?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Fall of Constantinople</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/constantinople-under-siege</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2024 00:30:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[May 1453 saw the siege that would lead to the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Over time, MTV became the home of everything from Beavis and Butthead to Jackass to Teen Mom. Naturally, in the process of courting young people’s attention, MTV has courted controversy. All those programs mentioned above, plus many more, have pushed the envelope of good taste and what’s acceptable on TV.

Taken from 'City in the Sky' (2016)
At any one time, there are a million people flying above our heads. But what does it take to run this 'city' 30,000 feet up in the sky? This fascinating series explores the hidden world of aviation, revealing the inner workings of the airports, factories and facilities that collectively keep this vast global network functioning. Delving into the science and engineering underpinning the aviation industry, the series introduces the people who keep the whole thing up and running as well as the hidden networks that air travel depends on. Filmed at some of the biggest, busiest, coldest and most remote airports in the world, City in the Sky builds a unique picture of the globally connected system that has transformed the way we live in the 21st century. And with air-passenger numbers predicted to double in the next 20 years, it also looks at what the industry will have to do to keep up.

Watching TV is an American pastime; whole generations have been raised by that glowing box. 
But live television, usually reserved for news, sporting events, and a single Saturday night-airing sketch comedy show, retains its capacity to capture true-life drama as it unfolds in real time. And those images become unforgettable moments in modern history.

2024 saw over 60 elections worldwide, many of which were marked with controversy. It was undoubtedly a divisive year both within and along borders. The war in Ukraine is now in its third year. Syrian rebels toppled the Assad regime after years of fighting. South Korea erupted into chaos after the prime minister declared martial law and was subsequently impeached. In the United States, President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed VP Kamala Harris, who ultimately lost to Donald Trump. 

Despite the tumultuous, seemingly never-ending wave of current events people still found escape and unity in the Olympics, Brat summer, and a rambunctious pygmy hippo. 

2024 had much of the world voting for change. Onward, to 2025 where we will find out what it means.

Correction: At 4:16 we show the wrong clip of Pope Francis. Our clip shows him visiting Myanmar in 2017 — we meant to include a clip from his 2024 visit to Indonesia.

From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.Why the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon Transformer-based AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.It's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet launched in June held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while OpenAI's o1 used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. Advanced Voice Mode and NotebookLM also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable music synthesis models and also better AI video generators, including several from China.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
