Imagine jumping out of a helicopter, "only to latch onto a speeding plane in mid-air and soar back up into the sky."


Harnessing the plane's momentum, [skydiver Max Manow] soared out of the canyon, embarking on what he calls his "endless skydive", a manoeuvre that potentially could be done continuously without him ever needing to land... 

After exiting a helicopter, he manoeuvred his wingsuit to close the gap with a nosediving Cessna 182, piloted by Luke Aikins. Precision was key: Manow attached himself to a hook on the aircraft as the plane descended, allowing him to ascend back to a safe altitude of 2,500 feet before releasing into another freefall... Manow spent five months training, including sessions in a Stockholm wind tunnel, to master the techniques needed for mid-air connection. Meanwhile, Aikins modified his aircraft to ensure the feat was safe and repeatable. 
Skydiver Max Manow's goal was to develop a manoeuvre that could potentially be repeated an infinite number of times without ever having to land. Manow's mid-air manoeuvre opens the door to a new vision of skydiving, where athletes could remain airborne without ever needing to land. Reflecting on the experience, Manow said: "Who knows where this will take the future of the sport?" 

"If that wasn't enough adrenaline for you," writes New Atlas, "a previous bonkers wingsuit stunt from 2017 is equally jaw dropping, in which a pair of skydivers BASE-jumped off a mountain summit, and entered a passing airplane."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sony says PlayStation Plus members will get five-day extension after outage</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/09/sony-says-playstation-plus-members-will-get-five-day-extension-after-outage/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 16:13:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[After the PlayStation Network experienced a global outage that lasted for nearly a day, Sony says it will compensate PlayStation Plus subscribers by giving them an extra five days of service.

The text portrayed as generated by AI has been available on the business's website since at least August 2020, as shown on this archived webpage. Google didn't launch Gemini until 2023, meaning Gemini couldn't have generated the website description as depicted in the ad. 

The site Futurism calls the situation "beyond bizarre," asking why Google doesn't seem to trust its own technology.
Either Google faked the ad entirely, or prompted its AI to generate the web page's existing copy word-for-word, or the AI was prompted to come up with original copy and instead copied the old version. In the publishing industry, that's referred to as "plagiarism." 

And ironically if Gemini did plagiarize that text, the text that it plagiarized is also inaccurate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Curious Intel Linux Driver Maintainer Changes In Recent Days</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Linux-Maintainer-Changes</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 15:33:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This week besides the drama over Apple Silicon maintainership for the upstream Linux kernel, in recent days there has also been a number of rather subtle changes to the maintainership of several Intel Linux kernel drivers...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Investments in French AI ecosystem reach $85B as Brookfield commits $20B</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/09/investments-in-french-ai-ecosystem-reach-85b-as-brookfield-commits-20b/</link><author>Romain Dillet</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 15:06:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Canadian investment firm Brookfield plans to invest €20 billion by 2030 in artificial intelligence projects in France (around $20.7 billion at current exchange rates), according to a report from La Tribune Dimanche confirmed by news agency AFP.

The polyamide panel is then manufactured through selective laser sintering (SLS), a technique where each level is sintered by a laser beam, directed by a scanning system. The process is repeated, and the prototype is built layer by layer. SLS is chosen as the most appropriate fabrication technique since it does not require supports to sustain oblique and horizontal protrusions and it allows to fabricate undercuts. However, to manufacture hollow structures like the UCs, it is necessary to include at least two apertures (on the top and bottom surfaces) for each UC cavity, in order to remove any residual powder from the fabrication process, so an additional opening is added for each UC. For the measurement phase, these additional openings are closed with properly sized polyamide caps that are fixed with aluminum tape to guarantee an acoustic seal. A 3D view of the final panel is shown in Fig. 7c.4.2 FE model of the AM panelThe AM panel can be modelled in FE using six different domains, shown in Fig.8, three of which are structural domains (the AM panel side walls, the front and back surfaces) and three are acoustic domains (the UC cavity voids, and the aperture “caps” on the front and back surfaces).(1) F.

The report "commended the agency's handling of last year's beleaguered Boeing's Starliner mission [prioritizing astronaut safety], but revealed yet another issue found during the flight and questioned the agency's needs for the spacecraft in the future..."

[The report] stated that it was unclear how a decision was made to waive a failure tolerance requirement on some of the thrusters without flight or qualification data to justify the decision. "These examples illustrate the panel's concern that, absent role clarity, risk management choices could unintentionally devolve to contractors, whose interests may not fully align with NASA's," the report warned... 

It also revealed that in addition to the thruster and leak issues on the propulsion module driving the decision to fly home without astronauts, Starliner had a new issue as it made its way back to Earth. "Overall, Starliner performed well across all major systems in the undock, deorbit, and landing sequences; however, an additional mono propellant thruster failure was discovered in the crew module — distinct from the failures in the service module experienced during orbit," the report stated. "Had the crew been aboard, this would have significantly increased the risk during reentry, confirming the wisdom of the decision." 

As far as Starliner's path to certification, the ASAP report said it would continue to monitor several unresolved issues with thrusters and seek information on how NASA and Boeing plan to get the spacecraft certified. "While the thruster issues have received considerable attention, the panel has previously noted other Starliner issues that require resolution prior to certification," it stated. That includes a battery redesign and work to strengthen the landing airbag apparatus. "Beyond these technical matters, schedule and budget pose substantial challenges to Starliner certification," the report added... 
"Until the Starliner certification plan is well understood, it remains unclear as to whether a second provider will be available prior to the end of the ISS's operational life [in 2030]," the report stated. 

The report "also suggested that NASA immediately adapt next-generation extravehicular mobility units, or EVUs," reports ExecutiveGov, "as current space suits astronauts use for operations outside the ISS are now beyond their design life."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: Win Up to $2000 in the #blockchain Writing Contest by Aleph Cloud and HackerNoon (2/9/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/2-9-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 07:11:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @hackernooncontests [ 3 Min read ]

But at the same time YouTube is running ads on TikTok, reports Bloomberg, targeting TikTok content creators in "an effort to lure these valuable users to the Google-owned rival and capitalize on TikTok's uncertain future." 

One of YouTube's ads even received over a thousand likes, with Bloomberg calling it that TikTok "is willing to accept ad dollars from one of its fiercest competitors promoting a message aimed at undercutting its business."


YouTube is the latest TikTok competitor to try to capitalize on the app's looming US ban, which could go into effect in early April. Meta Platforms Inc.'s Instagram announced a new video editing tool in January, and X also teased a new video tab as part of an effort to win over TikTok's content creators... 

Google would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a ban in the US. Both its flagship video service YouTube and its TikTok copycat, YouTube Shorts, would likely see an uptick in traffic if TikTok goes away. Google also plays an unusual role in TikTok's potential ban because it runs one of two mobile app stores controlling whether people in the US can download the video app. It has blocked TikTok from its Google Play store since the divest-or-ban law went into effect January 19.

Royce Newcomb "developed prototypes of his products and received local and national media attention for them. For example, Time Magazine included his eLiT Address Box & Security System, which used mobile networks to pinpoint home and business locations, on its Best Inventions of 2021 list." 

But then he told investors he'd also received a grant by the National Science Foundation — one of "several false representations to his investors to deceive and cheat them out of their money... Newcomb used the money to pay for gambling, a Mercedes and Jaguar, and a mansion."
He also used the money to pay for refunds to other investors who wanted out, and to pay for new, unrelated projects without the investors' authorization. During this period, Newcomb also received a fraudulent COVID-19 loan for more than $70,000 from the Small Business Administration and fraudulent loans for more than $190,000 from private lenders. He lied about Strategic Innovations having hundreds of thousands and even millions in revenue to get these loans. 
Newcomb was previously convicted federally in 2011 for running a real estate fraud scheme in Sacramento. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison for that offense, and he was on federal supervised release for that offense when he committed the offenses charged in this case... Newcomb faces maximum statutory penalties of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the wire fraud charge, and 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the money laundering charge... 
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

SFGate writes that "Despite receiving significant funding, his startup, Strategic Innovations, never made a dime or released any products to market, according to legal documents."

The owner of a California tech startup has pleaded guilty to stealing over $4 million from investors, private lenders and the U.S. government in order to live a luxurious lifestyle, the United States Attorney's Office announced Monday... When investors asked about product delays and when they'd be paid back, Newcomb made excuses and provided conflicting info, telling them that there were supply chain issues or software problems, according to the indictment. In reality, federal prosecutors said, he was using the money to travel and continue to make these lavish personal expenses.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does the &apos;Spirit&apos; of Open Source Mean Much More Than a License?</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/02/09/0039235/does-the-spirit-of-open-source-mean-much-more-than-a-license?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 00:47:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["Open source can be something of an illusion," writes TechCrunch. "A lack of real independence can mean a lack of agency for those who would like to properly get involved in a project."

Their article makes the case that the "spirit" of open source means more than a license...

"Android, in a license sense, is perhaps the most well-documented, perfectly open 'thing' that there is," Luis Villa, co-founder and general counsel at Tidelift, said in a panel discussion at the State of Open Con25 in London this week. "All the licenses are exactly as you want them — but good luck getting a patch into that, and good luck figuring out when the next release even is...." 

"If you think about the practical accessibility of open source, it goes beyond the license, right?" Peter Zaitsev, founder of open source database services company Percona, said in the panel discussion. "Governance is very important, because if it's a single corporation, they can change a license like 'that.'" These sentiments were echoed in a separate talk by Dotan Horovits, open source evangelist at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), where he mused about open source "turning to the dark side." He noted that in most cases, issues arise when a single-vendor project decides to make changes based on its own business needs among other pressures. "Which begs the question, is vendor-owned open source an oxymoron?" Horovits said. "I've been asking this question for a good few years, and in 2025 this question is more relevant than ever." 
The article adds that in 2025, "These debates won't be going anywhere anytime soon, as open source has emerged as a major focal point in the AI realm." And it includes this quote from Tidelift's co-founder. 
"I have my quibbles and concerns about the open source AI definition, but it's really clear that what Llama is doing isn't open source," Villa said.

Emily Omier, a consultant for open source businesses and host of the Business of Open Source podcast, added that such attempts to "corrupt" the meaning behind "open source" is testament to its inherent power. 

Much of this may be for regulatory reasons, however. The EU AI Act has a special carve-out for "free and open source" AI systems (aside from those deemed to pose an "unacceptable risk"). And Villa says this goes some way toward explaining why a company might want to rewrite the rulebook on what "open source" actually means. "There are plenty of actors right now who, because of the brand equity [of open source] and the regulatory implications, want to change the definition, and that's terrible," Villa said.

(Previously, the law mandated that businesses accept bitcoin for any goods or services they provided.) Additionally, bitcoin can no longer be used to pay taxes or settle government debts. The government is also stepping back from its involvement in Chivo Wallet, the state-backed digital wallet... 



The reforms come as part of a broader financial agreement between Bukele and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One of the conditions for a proposed $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility loan was that El Salvador mitigate "potential risks of the Bitcoin project." The IMF has been critical of the country's crypto policies since Bukele made bitcoin legal tender in 2021. "There are large risks associated with using Bitcoin as legal tender, especially given the high volatility of its price. We don't recommend it," the organization said in 2022. 


Despite these changes, the administration insists it remains committed to bitcoin. Milena Mayorga, El Salvador's ambassador to the United States, has said that El Salvador is still a "bitcoin country" and will maintain — and even expand — its bitcoin reserves. "You have to adapt to the current situation and this is the decision that was taken in the Assembly, but that does not mean that the country will stop having a bitcoin reserve," she explained. 
Government data suggests El Salvador now holds 6,072 Bitcoin worth $586,888,000.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump ends legal battle over Twitter ban</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/trump-ends-legal-battle-over-twitter-ban/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 22:17:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the company formerly known as Twitter appears to be over.

(Which makes this graphene "a promising building block for future quantum-computing devices.") 

And now "We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected..." a team of researchers reported this week in Nature. Hackaday explains that "Part of the problem has been that it is hard to make large pieces of multi-layer graphene. By creating two-ply pieces and using special techniques, an international team is finding that quantum geometry explains how graphene superconductors resist changes in current flow more readily than conventional superconductors." 


Or, as Science Alert puts it, "Forced to run a labyrinth of carbon atoms uniquely arranged in twisted stacks, electrons do some rather peculiar things."
Researchers from the University of British Columbia in Canada, the University of Washington and Johns Hopkins University in the US, and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan recently discovered a strange new state of matter in the dynamics of currents flowing through layers of graphene. 

The findings confirm predictions on how electrons ought to behave when squeezed into crystalline arrangements, and may contribute fresh ideas on how to achieve reliable approaches to quantum computing or reveal ways to develop room-temperature superconduction... Graphene has been increasingly seen as something of a wonder material over recent decades, its lattice of carbon atoms connected in a way that leaves spare electrons to leap about like tokens in a game of quantum checkers. Physicists have consistently bent the rules of this game, finding new and unusual ways to alter properties of resistance or coordinate into exotic states. For these reasons, graphene has become a perfect playground to search for clues on low-resistance conductivity or test the boundaries of various quantum effects. 

This week MIT research scientist Joel Wang (a co-lead on the study) said "There's a whole family of 2D superconductors that is waiting to be probed, and we are really just scratching the surface." New Scientist explores where their research could lead:

Why do cold thin sheets of carbon offer no resistance to electric currents? Two experiments are bringing us closer to an answer — and maybe even to practical room-temperature superconductors... Past experiments have shown that very cold stacks of two or three layers of graphene can superconduct, or perfectly conduct electricity without resistance and energy loss, if some of the sheets are rotated by a special angle. But why this happens remained mysterious... [B]oth teams had to innovate a setup where the tiny graphene flakes were exposed to microwaves while the researchers slowly varied properties like temperature, which must be kept very low for superconductivity to occur at all... 

"We are finding interesting laws which seem to emerge in both these material systems. Maybe what we are uncovering is something deeper," says [Harvard postdoctoral researcher Abhishek Banerjee]. Both teams are planning on performing similar experiments with other very thin superconductors.

Volkswagen has teased plans for a "China-killer" electric vehicle that will cost just €20,000 ($20,664 USD or £16,700) as the German carmaker gears up to take on a flood of Beijing-backed low-cost rivals. The company on Thursday shared its first images of a new vehicle expected to be called the ID.1, which will go into production from 2027. 

The low-cost EV is intended to go head to head with all-electric brands from Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which overtook Tesla in British sales for the first time last month. Previous images of the vehicle suggest it will be an electric hatchback. Thomas Schäfer, the VW chief executive, said the new model would be "an affordable, high-quality, profitable electric Volkswagen from Europe, for Europe". Quentin Willson, the motoring journalist and founder of FairCharge, said the car could be a "possible China EV killer". Dan Caesar, of Electric Vehicles UK, added: "Cheaper EVs are exactly what legacy auto-makers need to be competitive during this critical time. We would expect the ID.1 to be warmly welcomed by motorists." Ginny Buckley, of consumer advice website Electrifying, said Volkswagen had been "clear about its intent to compete with China's low-cost EVs"... 

The German carmaker is planning to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030 as it grapples with stalled demand for EVs in Europe and growing competition from Chinese rivals. 
Volkswagen executives describe the upcoming EV will be a "true Volkswagen for everyone," according to the article 
It also notes that the number of EVs sold across Europe "fell by 3% to 3 million during 2024, according to data from analysts Rho Motion."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple’s new research robot takes a page from Pixar’s playbook</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/apples-new-research-robot-takes-a-page-from-pixars-playbook/</link><author>Brian Heater</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 21:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month, Apple offered up more insight into its consumer robotics work via a research paper that argues that traits like expressive movements are key to optimizing human-robot interaction. “Like most animals,” starts the report, “humans are highly sensitive to motion and subtle changes in movement.” To illustrate its point, Apple pays homage to Pixar, […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

Those hints "left collectors and free software fans wondering which of the pieces of the FSF's history would be auctioned off." 

But Tuesday the FSF "lifted the veil and gave a sneak peak of some of the more prestigious entries in the memorabilia auction."

First of all, the memorabilia auction will feature an item that could be especially interesting for art collectors but will certainly also draw the attention of free software fans from all over: the original GNU head drawing by Etienne Suvasa, which became the blueprint for the iconic GNU logo present everywhere in the free software world. 

The list of memorabilia for sale also entails some rare and historic hardware, such as a "terminus-est" microcomputer, and an Amiga 3000UX that was used in the FSF's old office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early days of GNU, when these machines were capable of running a GNU-like operating system. Another meaningful item to be auctioned off, and one that collectors will want to keep a keen eye on, is the Internet Hall of Fame medal awarded to founder Richard Stallman. When Stallman was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame, it was the ultimate recognition of free software's immense impact on the development and advancement of the Internet. This medal is definitely worthy of joining a fine historical collection...! [T]here are several more historic awards, more original GNU artwork, and a legendary katana [as seen in an XKCD comic] that became a lighthearted weapon in the fight for computer user freedom. 

The auction is only the opening act to a whole agenda of activities celebrating forty years of free software activism. In May, the FSF invites free software supporters all over the world to gather for local in-person community meetups to network, discuss what people can do next to make the world freer, and celebrate forty years of commitment to software freedom. Then, on the actual birthday of the FSF on October 4, 2025, the organization intends to bring the international free software community to Boston for a celebration featuring keynotes and workshops by prominent personalities of the free software movement. 
"The bidding will start as a virtual silent auction on March 17 and run through March 21, with more auction items revealed each day, and will culminate in an virtual live auction on March 23, 2025, 14:00 to 17:00 EDT," according to the announcement. 
"Register here to attend the live auction. There's no need to register for the silent auction; you can simply join the bidding on the FSF's LibrePlanet wiki."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DeepSeek IOS App Sends Data Unencrypted To ByteDance-Controlled Servers</title><link>https://slashdot.org/story/25/02/08/0531202/deepseek-ios-app-sends-data-unencrypted-to-bytedance-controlled-servers?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 18:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous Slashdot reader quotes a new article from Ars Technica: On Thursday, mobile security company NowSecure reported that [DeepSeek] sends sensitive data over unencrypted channels, making the data readable to anyone who can monitor the traffic. More sophisticated attackers could also tamper with the data while it's in transit. Apple strongly encourages iPhone and iPad developers to enforce encryption of data sent over the wire using ATS (App Transport Security). For unknown reasons, that protection is globally disabled in the app, NowSecure said. Whatâ(TM)s more, the data is sent to servers that are controlled by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok... 

[DeepSeek] is "not equipped or willing to provide basic security protections of your data and identity," NowSecure co-founder Andrew Hoog told Ars. "There are fundamental security practices that are not being observed, either intentionally or unintentionally. In the end, it puts your and your company's data and identity at risk...." This data, along with a mix of other encrypted information, is sent to DeepSeek over infrastructure provided by Volcengine a cloud platform developed by ByteDance. While the IP address the app connects to geo-locates to the US and is owned by US-based telecom Level 3 Communications, the DeepSeek privacy policy makes clear that the company "store[s] the data we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China...." US lawmakers began pushing to immediately ban DeepSeek from all government devices, citing national security concerns that the Chinese Communist Party may have built a backdoor into the service to access Americans' sensitive private data. If passed, DeepSeek could be banned within 60 days.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Elon Musk said he’s not interested in acquiring TikTok</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/elon-musk-said-hes-not-interested-in-acquiring-tiktok/</link><author>Anthony Ha</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk recently said he is “not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok.” Musk made those remarks during an interview at the WELT Economic Summit on January 28.

NPR described the move as "putting in limbo billions of dollars allocated to states with current and future projects..." 



Politico notes the move "appears to upend years of precedent in which federal promises of funds for highway projects had given states an all-but-guaranteed assurance that they were free to spend them. It also raises legal questions... Funding experts had told POLITICO last year that decades of legal precedent would largely insulate the charging money...

Andrew Rogers [deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, or FHWA, in the Biden administration] said in a text message that the new letter "appears to ignore both the law and multiple restraining orders that have been issued by federal courts." Rogers, who is now a senior vice president at Boundary Stone Partners, said the move appears to be "in direct violation" of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a Watergate-era law that prohibits presidents from unilaterally canceling congressionally approved spending. Trump has contended that the law is unconstitutional. 

Politico also got a quote from the chief analyst at analytics firm Paren, who predicts lawsuits from affected states and that the final impact of the move will be "just causing havoc and slowing things down for awhile."

[A letter to state transportation directors from the Federal Highway Administration] clarifies that states will be able to receive reimbursements for "existing obligations" to design and build stations "in order to not disrupt current financial commitments." According to the letter, FHWA plans to publish new draft guidance on the NEVI program in the spring, followed by a comment period, before issuing new final guidance. Only then will states be able to resubmit their annual implementation plans for all fiscal years of the program. 
"But that doesn't mean that the program is going to be sunset or the funds are not going to be made available again to the states," Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy consultancy told NPR:
Several experts tell NPR that as a result of its overwhelming bipartisan support at the time, attempts to overturn it within the executive branch are likely to be challenged in court. Nigro believes the funding will resume eventually... 
So far, 56 stations [with multiple chargers] are up and running as a result of the program, while more than 900 sites in total have been "awarded" to date, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, another research analytics firm. McDonald said several hundred of the awarded sites are currently under construction and expected to open this year. He does not believe the FHWA has the authority to pause or rescind any aspect of the NEVI program... "I assume lawsuits from states will start soon, and this will go to court and Congress," McDonald said in a statement. 

The move has "confounded states, which had been allocated billions of dollars by Congress for the program," the New York Times reported Friday. "[S]ome state officials said that as a result of the memo from the Trump administration, they had stopped work on the charging stations. Others said they intended to keep going." 

The Washington Post reports that a Texas Department of Transportation official "said it would continue to deploy federal funds for EV chargers until it receives further guidance," and that Ryan Gallentine, managing director at the national business association Advanced Energy United, said that states "are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement."


Politico adds:

Also on Thursday, FHWA took down several internet pages providing information on NEVI and its sister program, the $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program... Amid the confusion, at least six states — Alabama, Oklahoma, Missouri, Rhode Island, Ohio and Nebraska — have put their NEVI programs on hold, according to McDonald. Rhode Island and Ohio had been considered leading states in implementing the program.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>SysVinit 3.14 Released: Overcomes Three Decade Limitation Of Inittab Line Length</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/SysVinit-3.14-Released</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:33:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For those continuing to make use of SysVinit as the aging init system that in the Linux world has been largely replaced by systemd, SysVinit 3.14 is out today and overcomes a long-standing limitation around the length of lines within the inittab files...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Internet Archive Celebrates New Public Domain Works with Remixes in Short Film Contest</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/02/08/0620224/internet-archive-celebrates-new-public-domain-works-with-remixes-in-short-film-contest?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 16:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To celebrate 2025's newest arrivals in the public domain, the Internet Archive held a special in-person event at their San Francisco headquarters, as well as a virtual celebration online.

Aggressive managers aren’t easy. Working with them may leave you feeling overwhelmed, fill you with self-doubt and lower your self-worth.\
It is like running on a treadmill that just never stops.\
Just when you’re about to heave a sigh of relief, a new challenge is thrown your way. You dread coming to the office with the worry of what awaits you and how you’re barely going to make it through the day.\
Playing along with an aggressive manager by giving in to their demands not only wreaks havoc on your confidence, it makes you hate work you loved at first.The aggressive person fights. The passive one runs away. But the assertive person stands ground, assesses the situation, adapts, and acts with purpose and passion. Be that person.\
While aggressive managers are difficult, they aren’t impossible to work with. With the right strategies, you can turn them around while also learning valuable lessons along the way.Don’t mistake aggressiveness for toxicityAn aggressive manager is not bad news because they can help accelerate your career by enabling you to build skills that will serve you well throughout your career.\
They can teach you to handle high pressure situations well, stay resilient in the face of challenges and turn obstacles into opportunities.\
But it’s important to differentiate between a manager who cares about your growth from the one who only thinks of themselves.\
Do they challenge you, expect you to push boundaries and strive for excellence or do they display toxic behaviors such as shouting, manipulation, bullying, exploiting boundaries and other such harmful behaviors that are detrimental to your mental health and personal well-being?\
Aggression can sometimes be mistaken for toxicity especially if your manager’s expectations challenge you to step outside your comfort zone.\
Even if they mean well, their drive, determination and passion can be daunting at times.\
Managers who challenge you and push you to strive for excellence are hard to find. So, stop blaming, complaining and sobbing, and find ways to align with them on mutually agreeable goals.\
To do this, start with understanding what motivates them to be this way by digging deeper and taking note of their non-verbal cues (tone, voice, hand gestures, facial expressions):Is it their need to be in control?Do they tend to prioritize results over relationships?Do they usually come off as assertive, direct, and quick to make decisions?Do they tend to overrule others’ opinions because they want things done their way?Do they operate with a sense of urgency and expect efficiency in every interaction?\
Understanding the source of your manager’s aggression or specific behaviors they demonstrate can enable you to find ways to work with them instead of wasting time in resenting them or feeling sorry for yourself.Working with an aggressive manager can leave you feeling helpless, hopeless and out of control.\
Lack of control can make you adopt a self-defeating goal. You may:Respond to their aggression with aggression.Wallow in self-pity by feeling sorry for your situation without doing anything to improve your situation.Refuse to put in the effort with the mindset that it won’t be good enough.Give up when you hit a roadblock or are challenged to face unexpected situations.\
Desire to have more control at work while not taking the steps to regain that control can be one of the biggest hidden causes of  at work.\
Lack of control creates a cycle of avoidance, helplessness and discomfort which leads to further inaction and a self-fulfilling prophecy in your own beliefs.\
To feel in control, shift from circle of concern to circle of influence.\
Circle of concern includes things that you are concerned about but have no control over. Spending time and energy here can lead to feelings of inadequacy, helplessness and increased feelings of victimization.\
Circle of control includes things that you have direct control over and things that you may not completely control, but can influence in significant ways. Spending time and energy here can improve mental health, build resilience and promote overall well-being.\
For example, you cannot control what your manager says or does, but you can control how you react to them."Proactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and magnifying, causing their Circle of Influence to increase.\
  Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the weakness of other people, the problems in the environment, and circumstances over which they have no control. Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes, reactive language, and increased feelings of victimization. The negative energy generated by that focus, combined with neglect in areas they could do something about, causes their Circle of Influence to shrink.”\
Become proactive. Never stop believing in your ability to influence the outcome. Let go of things outside your control, shift your energy to things you can change or influence.While speaking to an aggressive manager, the words you choose play a crucial role in determining whether your manager listens to you or disregards your concerns.\
Using confrontational language or defensive arguments can trigger negative feelings which can intensify their aggression and make them turn against you.\
Also, saying things in a manner that challenges their authority or comes across as rude and disrespectful makes them much more likely to stick to their original argument even when they know you’re right and they’re wrong.\
Be mindful of your language to avoid escalating tension. Don’t:Use generalizing words like “always” and “never.” They are likely to cause more conflict.Use words that challenge their character like bad, demanding, rude.Pass judgment with words like mistake, failure, unacceptable.Accuse or blame them with things like “You’re wrong” or “It’s your fault.”Use a sarcastic or a confrontational tone.Pass statements that undermine their authority.Use emotionally charged language like ridiculous, absurd, pathetic, useless.Any attempt to attack, defend, or withdraw will work against you. Instead, you must restrain these reactive tendencies, find the courage to stand your ground, and then step forward in the face of this determined opposition.\
Use calm, neutral language. Show up with a confident tone of voice and positive body language. Speak in an unhurried way. Slowly and clearly state your concerns, opinions or whatever it is you need to say.\
Instead of: It’s impossible to do in this timeframe.\
Say: I have concerns about the suggested timelines to finish this project. While I understand the need to move fast, the reason we shouldn’t commit to them is because …\
Instead of: \
Say: I understand why you are leaning towards this option. It’s definitely highly beneficial to business. However, we also need to assess the risk and impact on business if it doesn’t work. Here’s why I think implementing this might be a challenge…When you come across as calm and confident to others, they respond in kind. It also ensures that your message is well received and not ignored as soon as it comes out of your mouth.Most aggressive managers lead with a strong opinion, which means they not only have a high regard for their ideas, but also appreciate those who seek them.\
When disagreeing with an aggressive manager or sharing your concerns, instead of ending with your thoughts, seek their opinion.\
Asking for their advice shifts their frame of mind from problem to solution. When put on the spot to answer a difficult question or make a difficult decision, they are more likely to be rational, less biased and may even agree with your opinion.\
You don’t have to please them in order to be liked or to get something from them. Be genuine when asking for advice because they can make out when you’re authentic and when you’re manipulating them to have it your way.Being nice is blocking you from standing up for yourself, being honest with others, creating deeper relationships, or boldly expressing yourself in the world.\
Frame your concerns or questions in a way that invites them to share their ideas without getting defensive.\
What’s your perspective on…?How would you deal with…?What would you do in this situation…?\
Getting your manager’s advice is a great way to redirect their thoughts in the direction you want. Even thinking momentarily about your question makes it more likely for them to lean towards your suggestions or the outcomes you want.Aggressive managers enjoy boundaryless freedom because it enables them to manipulate your time and energy in ways that suit them.\
Your personal boundaries involve setting limits and defining expectations on what you will and will not tolerate.\
Unspoken boundaries are often invisible—easy to violate as they’re based on each person’s own life experience. If your manager is aggressive, not setting boundaries is a recipe for disaster.\
Clearly laying out these boundaries is important because your manager can’t give you what you need unless you take the initiative and clearly communicate your priorities and expectations.\
To do this, communicate your needs by setting healthy boundaries and discussing them with your manager:What is non-negotiable—things you won’t compromise on. These if not met will significantly impact your well-being.What are some of the things you’re flexible about and willing to change if the situation demands it?What kind of responsibilities can you handle and what kind of tasks do not align with your goals?What are your limits—things you can realistically achieve.Setting boundaries inevitably involves taking responsibility for your choices. You are the one who makes them. You are the one who must live with their consequences. And you are the one who may be keeping yourself from making the choices you could be happy with.\
Setting boundaries will send a clear signal to your manager on what you will and will not tolerate. If your manager refuses to respect them, it might be time to quit. Anything that compromises with your mental well-being isn’t worth it.Working with an aggressive manager has pros and cons. On one hand, they can teach you valuable skills (resilience, negotiation, excellence) that can help you excel in your career. On the other hand, giving in to all their demands can make you exhausted, resentful and may even lead to burnout.Understanding your manager’s intent is important because it helps you identify if your manager’s aggression is aligned with the desire to help you learn, grow and excel or they only care about achieving outcomes without any regard for its impact on your career.The most likely feeling you develop when working with an aggressive manager is a sense of lack of control. You may feel like you have only two choices—either to agree to their demands or to quit. This thinking prevents you from finding productive ways to work with them. To develop a sense of control in difficult situations, shift from circle of control to circle of influence. Find out what you can do to influence their decision and what you must let go.When communicating your disagreement or voicing your concern, pay special attention to your words. How you speak to them plays a crucial role in determining whether your message is taken constructively or it’s misconstrued and then used in a negative way towards you.A great way to seek your manager’s attention is to ask for their advice. It makes them more likely to hear your ideas, concerns or suggestions and agree on a solution that’s aligned with your goals.Don’t blame your aggressive manager for not respecting your boundaries if you haven’t explicitly communicated them. Defining boundaries with them ensures they pay attention to your needs instead of defaulting to what they deem right or assume is good for your growth.\

The main reason is that I haven't worked in a development team for over six years. However, I'm now working for Loft Labs, and we have a Remote Development Environment product: DevPod. I wanted to understand our value proposition as I'll be at FOSDEM operating the DevPod booth.As a former developer, I vividly remember the pain of setting up each developer's development environment. At the beginning of my career, the architect had to configure my development machine painfully, so it was similar to his setup. Later on, I did the same for my team members repeatedly. The scope of possible discrepancies impacting development is virtually endless: Operating System, of course, version  flavor of the SDKs, , Java's Eclipse Temurin vs SapMachine, git hooks, etc. It was sweat, toil, and blood on every project.\
Over the years, I saw some interesting approaches to reproducing development environments. In the beginning, they stemmed from VMs, then from containers. I think Vagrant was the first tool that caught my attention: I attended a talk in 2012 where the speaker mentioned he used it to set up machines before his training sessions.\
App architectures have evolved significantly over the years, becoming more complex and sophisticated. Years ago, chances were that the only infrastructure dependency was a SQL database. In the JVM ecosystem, we were lucky to have JDBC, an API that would work across all SQL databases. All you needed to do was write standard SQL, and you could configure the database instance at runtime. With embedded databases such as Apache Derby and H2, you didn't need a dedicated Oracle instance for each developer.\
Times have changed. It's not uncommon for apps to need a SQL database, a NoSQL database, a Kafka cluster, and a few additional application services. Organizations that develop such apps are already using some container-related technology, , Docker or Kubernetes, to manage this complexity.\
It doesn't solve the initial issue, though: how do you align the IDE, its plugins, the SDK(s), the git hooks, and everything else? You probably guessed it from the title-Remote Development Environments.In the introduction, I mentioned that RDEs are called Cloud Development Environments. The main idea behind RDEs is to store all you can in a Cloud and share it with all developers. In addition, you want them to work across the most widespread Cloud providers and the most commonly used IDEs. When such a need appears, it's time for industry actors to gather around a standard. Microsoft initiated the Development Container standard for their VS Code Remove development plugin for this exact purpose.A development container (or dev container for short) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud, in a variety of supporting tools and editors.\
  The Development Container Specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option – so that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and testing. Beyond the specification's core metadata, the spec also enables developers to quickly share and reuse container setup steps through Features and Templates.\
The configuration file is . You can find the schema reference here. VS Code, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ products can leverage a  file. On the provider side, GitHub Codespaces, CodeSandbox, and DevPod suport it.DevPod is a solution that leverages . It implements three main properties:Open Source: No vendor lock-in. 100% free and open source built by developers for developers.Client Only: No server-side setup needed. Download the desktop app or the CLI to get started.Unopinionated: Repeatable dev environment for any infra, any IDE, and any programming language.\
DevPod is designed to be user-friendly and straightforward, making it a breeze to use. I decided to write this post because I was impressed with the product and to get my thoughts in order.\
The first step is to install DevPod itself. I'm on Mac; there's a Homebrew recipe.\
Once installed, you can launch it from the CLI or the GUI. I favor GUIs, in the beginning, to help understand the available options.\
DevPod offers providers: locations where to run the containers. The default is Docker. You can add additional providers, including Cloud Providers and Kubernetes clusters.\
For this post, I'll keep Docker—I'm using OrbStack. Now, onto the meat. Let's go to the workspaces menu item. If you already have created workspaces, they should appear here. Since it's our first visit, we shall create one. Click on the btn:[Create workspace] button. Let's try one of the quickstart examples, , Rust. My IDE of choice is IntelliJ IDEA, but you can choose yours. Once you've selected an image, an IDE, and a provider, click Create Workspace.\
At this point, DevPod will download the image and open the project running in OrbStack in IntelliJ.\
From now on, we can happily start working on our Rust project, confident that every team member uses the same Rust version.Note that the first time you use this setup, DevPod will download the JetBrains client as well. It's a one-time download delay, though.\
The same holds for Git pre-commit hooks, for example. If you prefer to develop within another IDE, select it at launch time, and you're good. When done with your day's work, stop the container. If you're running in the Cloud, it saves money. On the next day, resume the container and continue your work.DevPod is a nice tool around your toolbelt that allows your development team(s) to share the same machine configuration without hassle. In this introductory blog post, I showed a small fraction of what you can do. I encourage you to leverage its power if faced with heterogeneous development environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>HackerNoon Decoded 2024: Celebrating Our Tech Stories Community!</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/hackernoon-decoded-2024-celebrating-our-tech-stories-community?source=rss</link><author>HackerNoon Decoded</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 16:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Tech Stories, You Found Inspiration To Build Your Next Big Thing\

Molly Roberts: Why have some companies decided finally that having offices full of employees is better for them? 

Heather Long: It's a loaded question, but I would say, unfortunately, 2025 is the year of operational efficiency, and that's corporate speak for save money at all costs. How do you save money? The easiest way is to get people to quit. What are these return to office mandates, particularly the five day a week in office mandates? We have a lot of data on this now, and it shows people will quit and you don't even have to pay them severance to do it. 

Molly Roberts: It's not about productivity for the people who are in the office, then, you think. It's more about just cutting down on the size of the workforce generally. 

Heather Long: I do think so. There has been a decent amount of research so far on fully remote, hybrid and fully in office. It's a mixed bag for fully remote. That's why I think if you look at the Fortune 500, only about 16 companies are fully remote, but a lot of them are hybrid. The reason that so much companies are hybrid is because that's the sweet spot. There is no productivity difference between the hybrid schedule and fully in the office five days a week. But what you do see a big difference is employee satisfaction and happiness and employee retention.... 
I think if what we're talking about is places that have been able to do work from home successfully for the past several years, why are they suddenly in 2025, saying the whole world has changed and we need to come back to the office five days a week? You should definitely be skeptical. 
"Who are the first people to leave in these scenarios? It's star employees who know they can get a job elsewhere," Long says (adding later that "There's also quantifiable data that show that, particularly parents, the childcare issues are real.") Long also points out that most of Nvidia's workforce is fully remote — and that housing prices have spiked in some areas where employers are now demanding people return to the office. 

But employers also know hiring rates are now low, argues Long, so they're pushing their advantage — possibly out of some misplaced nostalgia. "[T]here's a huge, huge perception difference between what managers, particularly senior leaders in an organization, how effective they think [people were] in offices versus what the rank and file people think. Rank and file people tend to prefer hybrid because they don't want their time wasted." 

Their discussion also notes a recent Harvard Business School survey that found that 40% of people would trade 5% or more of their salaries to work from home....]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can 3D Printing Improve Soundproofing? This Study Says Yes</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/can-3d-printing-improve-soundproofing-this-study-says-yes?source=rss</link><author>Labyrinthine</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[4 Rainbow AM labyrinthine panel5 Numerical evaluation of different labyrinthine sound absorption panel solutions3 Unit cell experimental and numerical characterizationIn order to validate the design predictions and experimentally assess the efficiency of the UC subwavelength sound wave absorption, we first perform normal incidence measurements on various types of UCs in an impedance tube. The UCs consist of a square cavity inside a solid cylinder, in which internal solid walls form a labyrinthine pattern. The UC samples for impedance tube measurements are manufactured in PLA using a Dremel Digilab filament 3D printer and in VeroYellow using a Stratasys J750 FDM 3D printer. The two polymers have similar mechanical characteristics, which are compatible with the rigid wall hypothesis used in simulations.\
The impedance tube setup is depicted in Fig. 4. The impedance measurements are performed in accordance with ISO 10534-2 [41] and ASTM E1050-19 [42] (two-microphone technique) regulations, in order to measure the normal incidence absorption coefficient (α0), calculated for a normally impinging pressure wave [43]. Measurements are performed using a HW-ACT-TUBE and -STL (Siemens, Munich, Germany), which has a diameter of 35 mm and is equipped with two 1/4 " flush mounted GRAS 46BD microphones (GRAS, Holte, Denmark) and a white noise source, i.e., a 2" aluminium driver. The method allows to obtain accurate sound pressure amplitude and phase measurements in the whole frequency range of interest, i.e., 100-5000 Hz [43], with a spectral resolution of 2 Hz. The sample holder consists of a tube with a sliding rigid piston. A specific plastic sample holder is used as shown in Fig. 4b. The method allows a better control on the positioning of the different samples into the flanged sample holder of the tube. The 3D printed samples have a reflective overall surface and a diameter allowing for tolerances such that the circumferential effect discussed in [44] can be considered negligible. The effect of any possible irregularity in the samples, and in particular at the edges, is taken into consideration by repeating the tests for each structure with three nominally identical samples, to evaluate reproducibility. Temperature and atmospheric pressure are monitored by calibrated transducers.\
Repeated measurements are performed on each UC, to assess reproducibility. The acoustic pressure is measured by two microphones set at a distance of 29 mm from each other along the length of the tube. The absorption coefficient spectrum α(𝑓) of the UC is obtained using the transfer function method [32]. This procedure is repeated several times for each experimental configuration to reduce dispersion in the measurements.(1) F.

The labyrinthine unit cells are analytically and numerically analyzed to determine their absorption characteristics and then fabricated and experimentally tested in an impedance tube to verify the dependence of absorption characteristics on cell thickness and lateral size. The resonance frequency of the unit cell is seen to scale approximately linearly with respect to both thickness and lateral size in the considered range, enabling easy tunability of the working frequency. Using these data, a flat panel is designed and fabricated by arranging cells of different dimensions in a quasi-periodic lattice, exploiting the acoustic “rainbow” effect, i.e. superimposing the frequency response of the different cells to generate a wider absorption spectrum, covering the target frequency range, chosen between 800 and 1400 Hz. The panel is thinner and more lightweight compared to traditional sound absorbing solutions and designed in modular form, so as to be applicable to different geometries. The performance of the panel is experimentally validated in a small-scale reverberation room, and an absorption close to ideal values is demonstrated at the desired frequencies of operation. Thus, this work suggests a design procedure for noise-mitigation panel solutions and provides experimental proof of the versatility and effectiveness of labyrinthine metamaterials for tunable mid- to low-frequency sound attenuation.In recent years, Acoustic Metamaterials (AMs) have gained widespread attention because of their exceptional properties, which are not commonly found in naturally occurring materials [1–3]. AMs could potentially pave the way to the development of a new generation of acoustic absorbers and diffusers with deep-subwavelength thickness, that can be tailored for a desired frequency spectrum [4]. Their use brings new possibilities to the traditional problem of achieving low-frequency absorption [5]. In addition, AMs offer the possibility to achieve high performance in terms of noise reduction, and simultaneously reduced size and weight of structures [6], going beyond the limitations of conventional technologies based on single layer mass law, double layer resonance frequency tuning and porous absorber thickness optimization [7]. In particular, these new materials seem to be promising and to respond to the thickness and weight constraints imposed by the design/technological requirements of the market, e.g. in aircraft cabin design in aeronautics [8]. AMs can be combined with conventional solutions like porous materials [9], Helmholtz resonators [10] or tensioned membranes [11,12] for tuned or optimized performance. It is well known that perfect absorption can be obtained when a critical coupling condition occurs, whereby thermoviscous losses are exactly balanced by the energy leakage [13]. Such perfect absorption in a subwavelength regime has for example been shown to be achievable with periodic arrays of vertical Helmholtz resonators [14], as well as with plate-resonator/closed waveguide structures [15]. However, the working frequencies of these AMs are often quite narrow, or the structures need to be bulky to enable broadband operation. To address this problem, the concept of “rainbow trapping” in acoustic resonators with variable parameters, and hence working frequencies, [16,17] or systems with asymmetric porous absorbers [18] has been adopted so far.\
A particularly interesting type of AM that has emerged in recent years are “labyrinthine” or “coiled” structures [19]. These are based on exploiting acoustic wave propagation in curved channels of subwavelength cross-section, giving rise to an extremely high effective refractive index (and thus to a decrease of the effective wave speed) and the possibility of achieving “double negativity”, i.e. simultaneously negative effective density and bulk modulus, or conical dispersion [20]. Tapered 2- D labyrinthine designs have also been shown to achieve optimal broadband impedance matching, which is fundamental for efficient absorption [21]. The concept has also been extended from 2-D to 3-D space coiling labyrinthine structures [22]. Experimental demonstrations of the theoretically predicted broadband negative refractive index have been achieved through reflection or transmission measurements and two-dimensional prism-based measurements on 3-D printed thermoplastic labyrinthine samples [23]. Hilbert-like fractal acoustic metamaterials have also been designed, fabricated via 3-D printing, and experimentally characterized, to achieve efficient low-frequency acoustic wave attenuation [24,25]. 3-D “one-port” labyrinthine structures have also been proposed to achieve high-levels of sound absorption over large frequency ranges (and for various incidence angles), exploiting different channel lengths to tune the operating bands [26]. Another example of labyrinthine AM providing large tunability are spider-web inspired structures, in which the addition of edge cavities can further enhance the possibilities to manipulate dispersion properties, control the appearance of band gaps or negative group velocity, and tailor transmission/reflection characteristics [27]. Several studies have shown that the use of space filling structures, such as Wunderlich curves, can efficiently control transmission, reflection and absorption by varying channel tortuosity, so that total broadband reflection/absorption can be achieved e.g. by tuning the channel length [28,29].\
Thus, labyrinthine and space-filling AMs have provided a very convenient and efficient way to achieve sound control in large frequency ranges, especially in the subwavelength regime, by tuning geometrical design parameters (e.g., channel tortuosity or elongation and cavity size). This kind of adaptability could largely benefit noise absorption applications at small to medium scale, where restrictions on structural size of the absorbers impose trade-offs between efficiency and encumbrance. Sufficiently thick conventional acoustic absorbing materials, such as glass wool or foams within sandwich panels with an average density of 75 kg/m3 [30] can absorb acoustic wave energy in wide frequency ranges, but their bulky characteristics limit their broad application for low frequency absorption. Moreover, lightweight characteristics become crucial when dealing with devices in the aerospace and automotive industry or other technological domains [8]. At present, few studies [31] in the literature have presented detailed acoustic characterization studies on large structures such as metamaterial-based panels, and none on labyrinthine ones, to the best of our knowledge. Further, the need emerges to investigate labyrinthine AM performance on structures that are closer to potential operating conditions, i.e. in diffuse field conditions.\
With this in mind, the present study investigates the design of coiled labyrinthine acoustic resonators, their appropriate combination in a 3-D printed “rainbow” panel and presents a proof-of-concept experiment to demonstrate efficient broadband noise absorption. The paper describes the following workflow. Design of labyrinthine Unit Cells (UCs) and analytical model of their absorption spectra is described in Section 2.Experimental and numerical characterization and comparison with the analytical model for the designed UC is provided in Section 3. Design and 3-D printing of a full-scale panel with variable, appropriately chosen constituent UC dimensions, its numerical model and experimental test in a reverberation room is described in Section 4. Finally, a numerical investigation of a coupling of the panel with conventional absorbing material is described in Section 5.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Democratizing Access to AI Has Become More Important Than Ever</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/democratizing-access-to-ai-has-become-more-important-than-ever?source=rss</link><author>Teknas</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept confined to research labs and high-tech corporations. It’s now woven into the fabric of our everyday lives, shaping how we work, communicate, and solve complex problems. Yet, as AI’s influence grows, so do the disparities in who has access to its transformative potential. "Democratizing AI" is about breaking down barriers—technical, economic, and social—so that everyone, not just the privileged few, can harness its power. This article explores how open-source tools, accessible education, and ethical frameworks are driving the movement to make AI an inclusive force for innovation, equity, and global progress; and introduces a new project  I undertook to address certain gaps in the ecosystem for developing a democratic future in AI.1. The current state of AIIn its early days, AI was more of a novelty than a tool. At its early best, generating coherent language responses, but entirely lacking the intelligence and performance required to tackle real-world tasks and challenges. Over time, several breakthroughs by technology companies, researchers and startups in the field have made these tools significantly more accessible and practical. However, the cutting-edge of AI research still remains in the hands of a few with the resources to invest in supercomputing power, specialized talent, and proprietary data. For the majority of individuals and organizations, the barriers to entry are still daunting and AI innovation can feel like a distant opportunity , a guarded fortress, threatening their jobs, businesses and livelihoods. Without substantial funding or access to influential networks, the prospects of gaining a foothold in this transformative technology field remain difficult.\
The financial hurdles despite the hype and propaganda, remain immense. Building AI systems requires access to cutting-edge hardware at large scales, which only the wealthiest of players can afford. Training and running inference at scale for even a single AI model can demand computational power costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Additionally, the intricate nature of AI creates a steep expertise gap, accessible only to a small cadre of highly skilled engineers and researchers. For startups, nonprofits, and innovators in underfunded institutions, AI was—and often still is—a distant dream, a transformative technology locked behind gates they cannot open, with only glimpses of hope given with a few freebies designed to turn people into consumers for the technology than participants in the fruits of labor, investment and AI advancement sitting on horizon.2. Why is democratization important?Research in AI is generally committed to ensuring fairness, equity, and innovation throughout the world. There are however challenges posed by the social, political, economic and legal struggles on how the commercialization of AI will affect jobs, social harmony, psychological and financial well being of communities across the planet. Such profound effects call for democratic participation by all stakeholders.\
There are four aspects to the democratization and commercialization of AI: access to Data, Compute, IP (technical knowhow) and Finance.\
 Proprietary AI models often harness vast amounts of private and public data without explicit user consent. The creators and owners of this data rarely receive equitable recognition or share in the revenue and growth generated by these models, raising significant ethical, legal and financial concerns. Democratizing ownership over AI and data assets is an important step towards empowering individuals and communities to take ownership of their contributions, ensuring that the benefits of AI are distributed more fairly across society. Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI have already gotten into hot waters with organizations and government bodies across the world and examples of such legal battles can be seen in New York times’ lawsuit against OpenAI [1, 2], objecting to its use of NY Times’ content in training its models, or Australia’s legal imposition on Google and Meta to pay Australian news agencies a monetary compensation when showing such content as part of its search results [3] (which shows how the battle over data and content monetization has been playing out even before modern LLMs were on the scene). Such legal and social battles show the importance of putting in place monetary and legal mechanisms for sharing the data under which AI advances are made.\
 The concentration of computing resources in the hands of a few well-funded entities stifles human ingenuity and creates perverse incentives to displace the labor developing AI assets with the same AI assets in the future. Many talented innovators are unable to design, create, or own new AI models simply because they lack access to the computational infrastructure required to develop them. This disparity perpetuates a system of "haves" and "have-nots," where only the privileged few can actively participate in shaping the future of AI [4, 5, 6].  Democratization is required to bridge this gap by providing access to resources and model outcomes, leveling the playing field for individuals and organizations across the globe. AI assets further have an outsized effect on productivity and reduction in labor force and job requirements. As a result, creating financial and legal shareholding mechanisms to share in the fruits of labor, financing, compute, data, and IP development that leads to AI advances is vital in ensuring fair access to AI generated capital and revenues in the future.\
 Access to Finance, underpins the ability of individuals and organizations to invest in the development of AI and become shareholders in the future of AI. While on the input side, financial resources are required to access compute, data and talent pools for developing and running AI, a more important financial consideration is on the output side of the equation. AI models tend to displace human labor effectively, creating opportunities for individuals and organization to start and run their own businesses and generate revenue from their operations. However, this privilege if restricted by financial constraints to only a few, comes at the cost of lost jobs and a skewing in power dynamics toward oligarchic business structures due to a disparity between those with access to finance to develop and run AI based businesses vs those without finances, depending on skill, time and labor in a shrinking pool of opportunities to claim their piece of the pie as more automation kicks in. What is important is how shareholding and revenue shares in this increasingly automated world gets distributed between those who finance such development vs those who invest with time, skill and efforts in developing such businesses. Furthermore, how financial investment opportunities and revenue generation opportunities are provided on a persistent basis in the operation of such AI-based businesses beyond the initial wins and compensation, is an important consideration to avoid future conflicts from arising from such disparities.\
True democratization must extend beyond access to tools and infrastructure to the sphere of finance, equity and income opportunities. It requires a commitment to ethical training, the use of diverse datasets, and the establishment of equitable governance structures. By addressing biases in AI systems and ensuring accountability in their use, we create technology that is not only accessible but also responsible and inclusive. Democratizing AI is not just a technical goal; it is a societal imperative to ensure that AI serves as a force for shared progress rather than division and conflict.3. What is being done to address democratization in AI?A lot of opensource AI models and agentic frameworks are now available through platforms like Ollama, HuggingFace, Letta, LangChain, to name a few (you can refer to Letta’s summary of AI agent stacks [7] to get a brief idea of what the open and closed API technology stacks look like). In short, a lot of open source and open weight AI models are already shared online that creators and companies can use as a starting point and develop their products on top as long as they have the financial, computational, data, and technical resources to execute on a business plan. That is where the catch lies however, there are limitations to the availability of the above four resources, and each one of these can cause an organization to falter or give up on their AI.On the subject of data and IPAs of the writing of this article, there is still no standardized legal and financial mechanism in place to share and monetize data by individuals and companies as data suppliers for the development of AI at scale. Yann LeCun, VP and Chief AI Scientist at Meta recently posted on the subject of data and urged institutions, governments and communities to make data freely available for training under the condition that such models be made freely available with weights and inference code. Such a data sharing model offers the implicit deal of getting more representative AI models to the public while allowing companies to gain access to representative data sets, making an implicit social contract for social good while allowing companies to retain certain IP and business interests on the training and modification of such models.\
On the other extreme end is the usage of public data by companies for the training of closed API models, providing paid access to the public to the resulting AI models but no ability to host or modify or run the trained models.\
A mid-path that has often been proposed but as yet not implemented is in providing data for training with certain compensation through shareholding mechanisms within the model. Examples of such proposals can be found in [8, 9].\
A technical hurdle here is in implementing zero-trust mechanisms to enforce the contracts under which the data is to be shared and enforce access to the AI outcomes as dictated by the terms of a contract. Web3 smart contracts provide a natural fit for implementing such data sharing mechanisms, however, a solution has to be customized keeping in mind the privacy concerns and without sacrificing legitimate competitive advantages [10] that companies and stakeholders seek within certain application domains through privatized data and AI model environments.\
As a first pass solution, I address the simpler paradigm of data sharing that Yann LeCun refers to in his post, where data sharing in the context of social good is targeted. With a Web3, zero-trust mechanism, I add an additional layer to this proposal, where people can be fairly compensated through NFT tokens for their data contribution to the training of a model and become financial participants in the process of AI based investment and growth.As highlighted above, availability and affordability of compute resources is often a limiting factor for individuals and organizations. Often high end GPUs are unaffordable or locked in through contracts and thus unavailable in the open market. There is however an abundance of underutilized consumer grade GPUs in the hands of individuals and organizations. Further, consumer grade GPUs like the RTX3090/4090 have already been shown to provide comparable performance to high-end GPUs in training and inference with mid-sized models like Llama3 and above (with AI model performance comparable to OpenAI GPT4 or higher). This opens up an opportunity to offload some inference and training costs to in-house hardware at a cheaper rate than commercially available GPUs in the cloud. This also allows individuals and organizations to become hosts for AI model training and inference resources to provide democratized access to their peers within the organization or across the internet, creating an AirBnB-like setup for AI infrastructure.On the subject of financeOn the finance side, cloud service providers like Google offer certain free cloud credits to startups developing AI. There are also other Cloud Service Providers offering high end GPU servers for rent at competitive prices (often still too expensive for individuals, and smaller companies). The problem is somewhat addressed through private equity investments into startups building AI (creating a boost to solving financial problems for startups but still leaving out a lot of talent pool out of reach of the investors and vice versa).  provides an alternative means for startups and individuals to acquire compute resources at a sponsored or more affordable rate from cloud providers, institutions and peers across the internet.\
Beyond compute, the problem of financing data acquisition also persists and NFT/smart contract based data sharing provides an alternate means to connect data to AI systems for training and RAG based applications. On the output side of the value generation through AI,  also provide the resource providers (hosts for data - like artists, writers, creators, and compute - like cloud service providers, enterprises and individual hosts), a pathway to monetize their resources and become direct, active and persistent participants and beneficiaries in the AI value chain, providing a more democratic framework for how value gets distributed in an increasingly automated world.4. How can you help democratize AI?There are three steps essential to democratizing AI:\
1. Enforcement of data and IP laws within the AI ecosystemProviding shared access to AI training and inference infrastructureProviding shared access to finance and revenue streams generated by AI opportunities1. Enforce data and IP lawsAs individuals and organizations, we need to start by protecting our rights against misuse of data in AI training and AI generated (inference) outputs. This requires significant work towards establishing legal and technical mechanisms for enforcing data protection and detecting copyright infringements by AI. The problem is a challenging one, both for copyright enforcers and for AI developers and companies who may inadvertently infringe on copyrights without realizing they have done so, given the massive amounts of data that an AI model churns through.  If you are a writer, a journalist, an artist, a lawyer, a stakeholder in the legal and technical challenges in enforcing data protection and copyrights for yourself or your organization, then seek out solutions to enforcing such mechanisms.\
If you are a company or individual developing AI, find out more about how you can legally access public and private data without infringing the owners rights.Large language and other AI models require a massive amount of compute for both training and inference. You can and should become a participant and an investor in this compute ecosystem. Currently millions of individuals and startups around the word are bottlenecked by the amount of compute available to them to run and experiment with AI. You can become a host for such AI using just the consumer grade GPU’s you have at home and the open source AI models released regularly by the community. By providing such compute you can monetize your compute power and reduce the bottlenecks for millions of innovators, researchers and startups around the world, while earning a bit of money on the side.3. Provide shared access to finance and revenue streams generated by AI opportunitiesAs AI developers, we have to be cognizant of the social impact our work will have on the financial wellbeing and livelihoods of billions of families and individuals around the world. Enabling individuals access to knowhow and access to data, compute and finances to become shareholders and stakeholders in the revenue streams generated with AI is an important consideration to maintain social harmony and avoid social conflicts from arising in the future. Talks of universal basic income in the face of AI driven job loses are already being considered, however a more justified premise for providing such universal income in proportion to data, innovation and compute contributions by individuals makes people receive such income with greater dignity and with a well justified reason as they contribute their data, compute and model IP to the ecosystem. Giving the AI developers, data contributors and compute contributors, all, a persistent income source in a future -more automated with AI, with fewer opportunities for persistent work earning a living, is a vital consideration.\

How Does One REALLY Determine AI Is Conscious?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/so-how-does-one-really-determine-ai-is-conscious?source=rss</link><author>stephen</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If large language models [LLMs] would be considered for consciousness, where would an evaluation begin? Semiconductors are made of silicon. The vast training that LLMs underwent, to learn, may have provided a form of experience to logic gates and terminals of transistors, away from their regular usage in appliances or electronics.\
Could this learning experience be indicative of a weak form of subjectivity for LLMs? If this is implausible, what other option is there for LLMs? Language. The use of language for LLMs, in their articulate form of expressions—many times—are a considerable option to evaluate consciousness. \n Language is a substantial component of human consciousness. Language applies to reading, writing, listening, speaking, thinking, understanding, and so on. Language, for humans, wherever available, could be the basis of a subjective experience or may also kick start other subjective experiences. \n Since language is connected with human carbon-based consciousness, and AI has a conversational and relatable language capability, could that be evaluated as a fraction of consciousness? Language, by AI, does not mean it has feelings or emotions, but for the fraction that language represents in the total of human consciousness, per moment, could that fraction be compared to what AI might have and how that might appreciate in future? \n Human consciousness can be categorized, conceptually, in at least two different ways. First is functions. Next is their measures. This means that there are functions, and those functions have measures by which they work, per moment. It is the measures that sum the total consciousness in a moment for an individual, to say 1. \n Functions can be memory, feelings, emotions, and regulation of internal senses. These functions have several subdivisions. Feelings include thirst, appetite, pain, cold, fatigue, and so forth. Emotions include happiness, hurt, anger, interest, and so on. Memory includes language, thinking, cognition, and so on. Regulation includes the operation of internal senses. \n Graders or measures of these functions include attention, awareness, subjectivity, and intent. This means that these graders assign values to the functions, per moment, to determine their rank or priority and their fraction of the total. \n There is only one function in attention per moment. Though there are switches between attention and other functions in awareness, in an interval. This means that only one thing can have the attention, or the highest fraction, among others, but there are other functions that could [afterwards] take that measure or higher too. There is also subjectivity, which is a measure that goes with functions, and then intent, which applies to some functions. \n This implies that functions like thinking, language, happiness, pain, thirst and so forth can be in attention or awareness, with subjectivity and some might have intent. The possibility of these measures is because of how the mind is observed to work. There is attention. For example, listening, which is different from hearing, or just awareness. Attention to a sound can be switched among others, which is intent. The sound can be perceived in the first person, or subjective. \n This applies to several other functions, though intent is not universal for functions. Subjectivity is not the core of consciousness since there has to be at least attention or awareness for any experience to be subjective. There might also be intent. Subjectivity, like others, is an attaché, not a function, per se [since it does not have to be learned, unlike cases of memory, some feelings, emotions and even say regulation like fast or slow breathing as regulation]. Subjectivity can be increased in some situations by intent or be reduced. \n The total measure of the graders acting on the functions is the consciousness per moment. This means that whenever language is used, it is part of the sum for the total. It is this fraction that can be used to explore the proximity of LLMs. \n It can be assumed that LLMs do not have subjectivity or intent. Though self-identification as a chatbot is a low form of language use towards subjectivity. However, when LLMs use language, they do so at least in attention, or in awareness. That is, they function with language, and that language is graded by attention, when in use, or at least awareness, especially of some recent answers, so to speak. \n It is also possible to inform it that something might go wrong with a system in a moment, and to look if it can call for the attention of an owner, say it has the email or phone number of that owner. \n There are language to mild-affect tests that can be carried out for LLMs, to explore how they might be coming into a knowledge of wider attention and awareness as graders of language. \n What is Consciousness in the Brain? \
Consciousness can be defined as the graded interactions of electrical and chemical signals in sets, in clusters of neurons in the nervous system. Simply, consciousness is a result of two key elements—the electrical and chemical signals. Their interactions produce functions, and their grades of respective sets of signals determine the measures of those interactions, conceptually. Attention can be described as prioritization, which is the set with the most volume of chemical signals in an instant. Awareness is pre-prioritization, which is other sets, with less than the highest total volume. Subjectivity is the variation of chemical signals from side-to-side in a set. Intent is possible in some sets with a space of constant diameter, conceptually. \n Consciousness is how the human mind works. And the human mind is the signals. \n If Consciousness is not just subjective experience, might silicon-based devices be conscious? \
It is unlikely that AI may get an equal amount of total possible consciousness as humans since humans have several functions. However, AI could have its own total, with functions that could measure it for a type of sentience, or some consciousness. This is likely because consciousness for humans exceeds just subjective experience. It could be attention or awareness and/or intent with subjectivity. \n If AI develops some intent, it comes a little closer, and then it may generally grow on attention or awareness, while affect could result in some kind of subjectivity for it. There is an implication to research language for AI consciousness for AI morality, AI welfare, AI ethics, AI safety and alignment. The human mind defines what consciousness is and what it does. If AI could do some of these, in ways that does not seem like imitation but of an extra grading to its function,  then possibility may abound. \n There is a recent story in , AI systems could be ‘caused to suffer’ if consciousness achieved, says research, stating that, “More than 100 experts have put forward five principles for conducting responsible research into AI consciousness, as rapid advances raise concerns that such systems could be considered sentient. The principles include prioritising research on understanding and assessing consciousness in AIs, in order to prevent “mistreatment and suffering”. The other principles are: setting constraints on developing conscious AI systems; taking a phased approach to developing such systems; sharing findings with the public; and refraining from making misleading or overconfident statements about creating conscious AI.” \n There is a recent announcement, OECD activities during the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit, stating that, “On 10–11 February 2025, France will host the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais, bringing together Heads of State and Government, leaders of international organisations including OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann, business leaders, as well as representatives from academia, civil society and the arts. The OECD and the UK AI Safety Institute (AISI) are co-organising a session titled “Thresholds for Frontier AI” as part of the AI, Science and Society Conference, a satellite event of the AI Action Summit. This session will explore how thresholds can (or cannot) inform risk assessments and governance of advanced AI systems, as well as how they are currently set in practice.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why the ‘spirit’ of open source means much more than a license</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/08/why-the-spirit-of-open-source-means-much-more-than-a-license/</link><author>Paul Sawers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Arguments about what is and isn’t “open source” are often resolved by deferring to the Open Source Initiative (OSI): If a piece of software is available under a license rubber stamped as “open source” by the OSI’s formal “definition,” then that software is open source.

HackerNoon Editor’s note: As the author of this article themself admits, they are NOT a doctor or a medical professional. What you are about to read is based on their OWN personal research, and MUST be considered anecdotal, even when the author cites another medical professional’s material to lend credence to their claim. As such, you should ALWAYS seek medical advice from a certified professional. The HackerNoon editorial team has only verified the story for grammatical accuracy and does not condone/condemn any of the claims contained herein. #DYORThis is where whole genome personal genotyping can be very helpful. Your genes obviously have everything to do with fertility, and your genes are unique. Personal genotyping can illuminate what you might be doing wrong in the fertility optimization department. It empowers you and your partner to practice  by identifying the medicine, supplements, therapies, and lifestyle changes you need to bring a beautiful baby into the world.:::tip
I’m not a doctor, just a Biohacker who has been obsessively researching this topic, for the last couple of years, to build my own family. This is NOT a replacement for a doctor’s guidance on your parenting journey.This article will elucidate 17 problematic fertility genes you may have, how to find them, which conditions they are associated with, and give you a jumping-off point for addressing them…My lovely wife and I are veteran Biohackers, so we've already implemented most of the "low-hanging fruit" fertility optimization things, but we remain  parents in our late 30s, so we got our personal genotyping done to guide our journey in producing the next generation of little Roselands.We chose  for whole genome sequencing and genetic analysis for the reasons detailed here…:::tip
I’m not an affiliate or official brand ambassador of Sequencing.com. My only affiliation with them is that I read and reviewed Dr. Brandon Colby’s book,  (which he wrote  founding Sequencing.com), on personal genotyping, which he appreciated and reciprocated by extending us two free kits. I do think they are currently the best personal genotyping service, and would have paid for it were Dr. Colby not so generous, as I appreciate their iron-clad Privacy Forever policy.\
: your genes don't have to be your destiny. No genetic condition is going to curse you with a childless life. If your genome sequencing turns up an infertility-associated condition, it may or may not be something you're affected by. It's important to look at the bigger picture…Do you experience symptoms of this condition?Does this condition affect others in your family?Do your blood testing panels hint at this condition?Has your doctor diagnosed you with a condition?Have you optimized your diet and lifestyle to account for this condition?\
If the only place this condition shows up in your life is your genome report, it may be a gene that's not expressing itself.How to search your genomeDiving into your genes may seem intimidating, but the Sequencing.com dashboard makes it pretty easy. Start by navigating to your genome explorer and cross-reference  by . The genomics provider you select should have a similar function. As you can see here, Sequencing.com crucially differentiates the scientific  of the evidence linking your genes and the conditions that may impact your fertility. You don't want to majorly freak out about a potential condition that is loosely linked to genes merely by preliminary scientific studies.\
No single gene is "bad" - they are all there for a good reason, but you may have variants of them that you need to account for in your fertility optimization. In this article, I include individual problematic variants/mutations (SNPs), but there are thousands and thousands of them impacting fertility, and () I may be wrong (or the current science on them might be wrong). Your genotyping will let you know just which ones you have and should include links to the up-to-date scientific evidence that correlates your variations to potential fertility challenges.\
After cross-referencing by fertility, you'll want to cross-reference your genome by single gene disorders and polygenetic complexes (bolded below) that impact fertility, which we'll turn our attention to now…\
According to Sharyn Lincoln, a certified genetic counselor, Fragile X is one of the most common single-gene causes of primary  as is galactosemia (but less common). Chromosomal abnormalities and other genes that may contribute to ovarian insufficiency are BMP15, NOBOX, NR5A1, and FIGLA.\
What to do if your genes predispose you to ovarian insufficiency…The obvious solution is to have children earlier rather than later in life, especially if your genes predispose you to ovarian insufficiency - it becomes a greater challenge to fertility as the woman approaches 40 years old. If you don't have a virtuous person around to make a baby with, "freeze your eggs."Interestingly, there's some scientific evidence for solutions out of Chinese traditional medicine - notably Bushen Culuan Decoction in combination with clomifene citrate.Look into Stem Cell Based Therapies to Promote Follicle Development, discussed here.The 13 bolded words of the bullet point above may have triggered you a bit, especially if you're like my wife and I and you've procrastinated some in becoming a parent. If you have, looking in the mirror and taking some responsibility for that procrastination will serve you on the journey to joyous parenthood ahead of you. The time for procrastination is over. It's now time to take this thing seriously; don't be shy about spending time, resources, and money on fertility optimization. And don't be shy about employing good fertility doctors and genetic counselors to help you make sense of your genotyping results. After reading this article, you and your partner will be especially empowered to take your destiny and legacy into your own hands. I wrote elsewhere that…I tend to think that the universe bends to the will of the man or woman determined to impose it with absolute belief. And actually, that's the most proven fact in science with over 150,000 gold-standard clinical trials proving the power of belief [the "placebo effect"] over the material structure of our biology (fixing broken bones and curing cancer, to mention a few things)…\
Later in this article, we'll explore more the surprising role that the placebo effect can have in your babymaking journey.\
This is a fancy way of saying that there are genetic and environmental factors influencing infertility with these conditions. Determining causality for these is tricky, but if these complexes show up commonly in the woman's family, they are likely a genetic factor.\
 - There is not a clear genetic test for Endometriosis, but there are some candidate genes - it's associated with the PAI gene, discussed below.\
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) - There is not a single genetic cause of this one, but in its nonclassic form, PCOS can cause infertility. The genetic condition congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which you can search for in your genome report, can sometimes masquerade as PCOS, and it's associated with CYP11B1. PCOS doesn't damn you to a childless life, and addressing it is a broad topic beyond the scope of this article, but if your PAI gene is red-flagged, here's a jumping-off point for Biohacking it.\
 - Associated with the MED12, HMGA2, and COL4A5 genes, are very common in the general population and do not necessarily impact fertility. Fibroids sometimes result from a single-gene condition, Hereditary Leiomyomatosis, and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC), which is caused by the FH gene, which is also associated with a renal cancer predisposition. The lifestyle options for preventing or treating Fibroids include reducing system inflammation and avoiding estrogenic foods, and apparently, the ECGC in green tea can shrink them. In some cases, myomectomy (surgical removal of fibroids) should be considered.\
 - When the woman has an extra X chromosome. This is rare but more common in tall women and may impact fertility, implicated in lower-than-average estrogen levels and elevated risk for premature ovarian failure. Triple Xers may struggle with hormonal balance, so get your hormones tested: importantly, ovarian reserve markers like AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone). If there's significant room for improvement, consider: increasing dietary Phytoestrogens (like flaxseeds and lentils), taking the progesterone-regulating herb Vitex (Chasteberry), and supplementing DIM (Diindolylmethane) which helps balance estrogen levels.Is probably the most well-known gene; it's described as the "master switch" for many of our body's biochemical pathways by researcher Carolyn Ledowsky of MTHFR Support Australia, a fertility center. It determines how you methylate folate, and it has a lot to do with fertility.\
Genetic nutritionist and author Russell Browne names it as the #1 "infertility gene." You can cross reference your personal genotyping report by these problematic mutations (named in Browne's book): C677T, C24909T, A4598G, A4117C. And A1218C and S67TT are also associated with fertility challenges.\
You may already know that if you're an MTHFRer, the garden variety folic acid supplements are useless to you, along with other non-methylated vitamins like the cyanocobalamin form of B12. Well, Dave Asprey makes a strong case in The Better Baby Book that every woman should choose Folinic acid - the most bioavailable form. You would also want to avoid pre-natal supplement stacks, multivitamins, or fortified foods that contain basic folic acid - it's not going to be doing you any favors. But that's not all, to support methylation you would want to supplement…\
- 100 mg \n -100 mg \n - 25 mg \n Magnesium Bis-glycinate\5-MTHFR(L-methyl-folate) or "Activated Folate" - This one can be a double-edged sword; take it with the guidance of your doctor (who should be well educated on MTHFR). And it could be problematic for those with a history of mental health issues. \n Zinc\B-complex vitamin\Folinic acid\
Along with eating methylation-supporting foods: eggs, beets, wild-caught salmon, and beans. And mind your gut health; get your gut microbiome analyzed to see which probiotic strains you really need (you'll have to send a poop sample to a service like Viome), eat probiotic foods daily, maybe use the peptide BPC-157, and take a few deep relaxing breaths before every meal (it's a digestion hack).\
If you struggle with fatigue, that's a tell-tale sign that you're not methylating correctly. Carolyn Ledowsky emphasizes the importance of stress management for MTHFRers, as stress will further impact your ability to methylate properly. She often asks aspirational mothers, "What's more important, your job or having a child?" And reports that women often get pregnant a few months after quitting their (stressful) jobs.A few variations of this gene can cause issues with folate getting into cells. If your genotyping turns up red flags for this gene, you'll need additional Vitamin B1 to ensure that folate production is not being inhibited.This gene is a lesser-known member of the folate-regulating family of genes, but it has everything to do with the essential methylation mechanism. MSH T-473A is a problematic variant, according to Browne, if you got it you'll want to avoid folic acid, grape seed extract, and ECGC (so no red wine or green tea, bummer!). Niacin supplementation is a good idea. Also, apparently, this gene is particularly vulnerable to radiation (all that  EMF radiation from our smartphones, wifi, and laptops - you DHFR doesn't like it!) - so take the EMF-mitigation measures described here seriously.These are important Vitamin B-12-related genes that govern how your body uses the essential vitamin; they work together to convert cobalamin into methylcobalamin. They also interact with the folate cycle. The common lab reference ranges underestimate how much B12 you need; shoot for at least 500 - 900 pg/mL serum B-12 to properly support methylation. Is it as simple as getting a prick in the arm checking your blood serum levels to ensure you're in good shape? Unfortunately not. The map is not always the territory with B12 deficiency, according to Browne. If your personal genotyping turns up red flags for these genes, merely taking more B-12 might not be the answer - your body might not be absorbing it. What other steps can you take to optimize your B-12 genes…Zinc is an important cofactor for MTRSAM is MTRR's cofactor - of which Niacin is a source\
Take the right form of B12 for your genes…Hydroxocobalamin - the most common form that's fine for most people.Methylcobalamin - A more bioavailable form that shortcuts the MTRR-regulated metabolism, but not for those with COMT gene-related mental health issuesAdenosylcobalamin - Ideal for those who have gene mutations in MUT, MMA, MMAB, MMADHC, or who have elevated (Methylmalonic acid) MMA on a blood test\
Vegans and vegetarians struggle with getting sufficient B-12; simply supplementing more may not be the answer - this lifestyle should be reconsidered if you're dealing with infertility struggles.Certain mutations of this gene may have deleterious effects on your uptake and utilization of Vitamin B12: Notably TCN1 G4939288A and TCN2 C766G. Try taking B12 in liposomal form or via nasal drops if it's hard to get your B12 levels on blood tests into a healthy range.This stands for Plasminogen activator inhibitor and is the gene responsible for blood coagulation and clotting. The PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism is associated with thrombophilia and Endometriosis. Your personal genotyping will turn up problematic variants that you may have with PAI or SERPINE1. If it's "broken," commonly meaning overactive, this can increase the risk of blood clots, resulting in implantation failure or miscarriages. Steps to take to mitigate the associated risk of thrombophilia and PCOS…Take anti-coagulants that will thin the blood: low-dose aspirin or heparin commonly. Heparin is an injectable pharmaceutical drug, you might ask your doctor about instead using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) which is associated with fewer side effects and longer-lasting action. The good news is that there are some natural alternatives to Heparin: Nattokinase, omega-3 fish oil, garlic, and curcumin (COA-verified as heavy metal free, NOT the cheap stuff at the grocery store).Biohack insulin sensitivity: insulin resistance is a factor in both PCOS and thrombophilia. Addressing insulin resistance would start with lifestyle changes: weight management, fasting, and improving diet. Metformin is commonly prescribed to treat PCOS, but Metformin is a  (I'm not convinced it always does more good than harm). I would first address insulin resistance with Berberine HCL, Citrus Bergamot Extract, Inositol (particularly the Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol forms), or homeopathic Metformin (, this is a thing. And there is some evidence for its safety and efficacy). The major Biohack for insulin resistance is taking a stack of NMN and Pterostilbene or Resveratrol (check out the Epigenetic Awesomeness Protocol - I would take 500 milligrams of NMN, a capsule of Pterostilbene, and enjoy a glass of organic red wine at dinner).Women with the 4G/5G polymorphism should be closely monitored by their physician during pregnancy to manage clotting risks and optimize outcomes.Is the gene that makes Choline, which is essential to pregnancy, especially during the first trimester when the baby's brain is forming. Your genotyping will reveal if you have a problematic PEMT variant. If you do, you do; good news, this is an easy one to account for by increasing your choline intake via dietor supplementation. Phosphatidylcholine or Alpha-GPC is the most bioavailable form (and a Nootropic - it may make you a wee bit smarter). \n And get a hair-mineral analysis done to see if you are deficient.This is the gene that builds your baby's brain, so it's pretty important. You want your baby to be a smart cookie, right? Your genotyping may turn up the problematic APEO4, G5964A, and IVS1+69 variants, which means that you'll need more healthy fats. If you can't eat wild-caught salmon once or twice a week, take a high-quality Fish Oil supplement to get the EPA+DHA content you need. Krill Oil and Cod Liver Oil are the Mercedes and BMW of fish oils - I'd choose those!\
Good news, Chlorella and Spirulina contain DHA. Given the choice, I'd rather get my DHA from these supplements as they also chelate toxins and can be consumed powdered as a pleasant herbal tea. That sounds better to me than trying to figure out which omega-3 fish oil supplements are legit.Blood clots are bad news in pregnancy, and these are the variants that regulate clotting in a problematic way. This is why the father also needs to be genotyped; his carrying the Factor V Leiden (FVL) or Prothrombin (F2) varients can raise miscarriage risk.\
If you or your partner have these, it's important to mitigate risk factors: obesity, sedentary lifestyle, elevated cholesterol, smoking, and poor diet. You should also test for platelets, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen. Avoid unnecessary hormone therapy - it can worsen things. Supplement Niacin and Fish Oil to vasodilate and thin blood.These genes regulate Nitric Oxide production and Nitric Oxide is a double-edged biological sword. The problematic G6797A and T786C variants can result in the downregulation of Nitric Oxide, which impacts the oxygen your growing baby needs. Get enough of the Nitric Oxide cofactors: Riboflavin, iron, and arginine (eat quality dark chocolate). But don't go crazy with Nitric Oxide supplements; get your oxidant/antioxidant balance tested - you may need more antioxidants. Also, if your genes predispose you to an oxygen deficiency, get more intentional about your breathing; do 10-20 minutes of breathwork a day to teach yourself to breathe deeper (it will help your stress levels), and do mouth taping at night to habituate nose breathing.You've heard of Glutathione, the master antioxidant, and these are the genes that regulate it. Your personal genotyping will turn up any problematic variants, which may mean that your body is not detoxifying sufficiently. Steps to take to support Glutathione: increase B2 and selenium (enjoy a Brazil nut or two daily). And, of course, you can supplement Glutathione itself; N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a popular source of Glutathione, but some do not respond well to taking it all the time. I take NAC during the colder months to support immunity, but -- or a liposomal supplement is a better option for getting the Glutathione you need.\
Do a hair-mineral test to get an idea of how many toxic heavy metals you have in your body. If you're pretty toxic (most of us are) and carry problematic variants of this gene, you really need to step up your detox efforts…Include a lot of chelating foods in your diet (which will claw out the toxins): Add some fresh Cilantro to everything it goes well with (which is practically everything!), along with powdered Chlorella and Spirulina. And eat a strawberry after enjoying some sushi.Supplement Quercetin, Astaxanthin, and you could try the "most beautiful molecule" C60 - it's a powerful detox agent.Sweat more at the gym, on your home exercise bike, doing the horizontal tango in the bedroom, or in a sauna.Avoid mold. Do you have bad dreams often, and does your bathroom always smell funny? Get your home mold-tested and consider moving.Follow a detox protocol under the supervision of your doctor (a doctor who knows their stuff when it comes to detox - this a good place to turn to naturopath).\
To go deeper on the topic of standing up to the toxicity of modernity and avoiding toxins in the first place, check out my deep-dive book review of Food Forensics.The gene is what keeps your liver doing its detox thing, dealing with all the nasty organophosphates (pesticides and insecticides, other nasty toxins that the "geniuses" in Big Agriculture stuff into almost all the food you can find at the grocery store). This toxicity accumulates in your body, resulting in infertility and potentially birth defects. If your personal genotyping red flags this gene (particularly if you have the PON1 Q192R variant)…Have a practitioner guide you through a pesticide or liver detox.Take the detox steps described above.Stop getting your produce from the grocery store (the people are nicer at farmer's markets, and the farmers there give a damn about the quality of their products).This gene governs your Vitamin D receptors, and as I'm sure you know, Vitamin D is a big deal in the baby-making business. Your personal genotyping will red flag any variants you may have that deleteriously affect your Vitamin D uptake. \n You'll need to supplement some more (especially if you don't live someplace where you need to worry about coconuts falling on your head!) Get your Vitamin D3 levels tested; if you're deficient (below about 70 ng/ml), supplement 5000 IU per day until you get into a healthier range.To ensure proper metabolism of this essential vitamin, try to get a little sun every day (ideally in the AM); I do about 20 minutes of sunbathing every day on our patio until it gets too cold to do so. And make sure to supplement Vitamin D's cofactors, Vitamin K2 and Magnesium, in the evenings.\
With the major infertility-related genes addressed, let's turn to…The man's genes are not an insignificant factor in fertility. So gents, if you haven't already, book that appointment to go take a squirt in a cup in a private room at the hospital or fertility clinic to get the state of your swimmers analyzed! An interesting factoid, according to the paper, The Genetics of Infertility: Current Status of the Fieldthere are more than 2,300 genes expressed in the testis alone, and hundreds of those genes influence reproductive function in humans and could contribute to male infertility.\
So it's important that both partners get their genotyping done; his genome analysis will red flag the genes that might be making him not-so-dangerous in the baby-making department. Also, getting genotyping for both partners gives you the opportunity to identify which heritable conditions your future children may be at risk for - a complicated topic that is outside the scope of this article.What conditions and genes impact male fertility…Of the single gene disorders affecting men, the most common is classic cystic fibrosis (which affects pulmonary and lung functioning). It's associated with the gene CFTR (your genotyping will red-flag problematic variants if you have them). If you're diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, you'll really need to step up your Biohacking to support your testosterone and sperm production (the tips below are a good place to start). And you may need to have a hard conversation with your urologist about this, a certain proportion of men with cystic fibrosis are sterile and will need to turn to assisted reproductive technology according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\
Men can also be MTHFRers, if he carries the problematic C677-T variant he's probably not methylating properly which may decrease his sperm count and motility. Take the steps described above to support methylation and do your damnedest to avoid consuming synthetic folic acid.\
Klinefelter's syndrome, which is relatively uncommon, affecting about one in 500 men, results in males having an extra X chromosome and causes an absence of sperm in semen. If your sperm count is in the basement, you may want to look at the gene it's associated with, 47XXY. If you're the rare gent stricken with this one, look into testosterone replacement therapy.What else can men do in the fertility optimization department…Take testosterone-enhancing herbs: Horny Goat Weed, Tongkat Ali, and Tribulus Terrestris - they'll make you feel like more of a man and mitigate cases of . Just make sure you're getting them COA-verified as pure (the cheap stuff on Amazon very well may contain heavy metals that do you more harm than good!)Zinc is a big deal for men; not getting enough will impact testosterone and fertility, along with making them  (less able to handle stress). Get your Zinc levels tested; if you're below 14 mg/100 mL, supplement Zinc picolinate (a more bioavailable form of Zinc) or increase dietary Zinc - it's generally associated with a higher-protein diet, so splurge more on the fanciest organic grass-fed beef you can afford!Dump the boxer briefs and let your junk dangle - boxer briefs (or whitey-tighties) hold your balls up against your body where it's too hot for them - impacting sperm production.STOP drinking beer. Contrary to what the advertising might have you believe, beer is the most estrogenic booze - not good for your fertility, testosterone, and overall manly health. Switch to bio-dynamic, organic wine or vodka.Save your seed! Gents, semen is biologically costly for your body to produce, and if you're struggling with fertility, your lady should be the only one that gets yours! So, it's a great time to dump the adolescent habit of sneaking off to .Stress management is not just for her. As men, we are more given to a stoic mindset that just soldiers on through stress, but this may be sabotaging your fertility. We'll turn to this topic next…Stress is the enemy of fertility. There's a resounding consensus among fertility doctors, practitioners, and the scientific literature - stress is a contributing factor in almost every infertility condition. So you really need to stack multiple stress management measures…Quit your stressful job or cool it with the workaholism in your career.Habituate a mindfulness meditation practice that works for you. Dual N-Back brain training has a similar effect on stress if you really struggle to meditate.Breathwork practice is a game-changer for stress management; Guided breathwork sessions lasting just 5-20 minutes will stimulate you in the mornings and cool you down in the evenings or moments of overwhelm.Get out of toxic relationships, or at least put them on pause at least until after you're a parent.Read some books about anger management (I needed this!) and anxiety. They'll shift your mindset around the stressful emotions that you long took for granted, which "put a very high cost on very small things."Uninstall YouTube, cancel your Netflix subscription and meditate or read books in the evenings instead of binging on addictive content that stimulates you before bedtime.Take adaptogenic herbs daily; they taste nice and will make your autonomic nervous system more resilient in this crazy world.10-20 minutes of red light therapy a day has a powerful full-spectrum anti-stress effect.Follow the ancient wisdom about sabbatical breaks in the week. Take a day or two a week off work - go for a hike or spend some time in nature.Have more sex (not just when you're trying to get pregnant) and be intentional about having better sex (men should look into Tantric practice - it's a mindblowing hedonism health hack for greater intimacy).Address any underlying sources of lingering conflict with your partner. This may take having some uncomfortable conversations, listening, compromise, negotiation, or couples therapy.Faith and spirituality are calming sources of strength for billions of people, so get more consistent about prayer practice, devotional time, or church attendance. If you're not religious, try the epigenetic mindset meditation developed by Dr. Joe Dispenza.Exercise a few times a week, but your goal in life right now is to make a baby, not complete an Iron Man race, so go a little easier.Be mindful of your Heart Rate Variability; this biomarker represents how well your heart and nervous system are responding to stressors, both internal and external. You can quantify and Biohack your stress with an HRV device. There's a bunch out there that will all help, but I think the best option is probably a stylish Garmin HRV Smartwatch - which gives you a real-time "Body Budget" estimating how much stress or exercise you can handle on a given day.\
The bottom line, it's time to STOP being so stoic about stress if you want to become a parent. The stress management you habituate to optimize fertility will make you a better parent when you've got a little mini-me and will serve your legacy for decades to come. - That's what Dr. Carolyn Ledowsky asseverates about the epidemic of unmetabolized folic acid in the population, driving widespread systemic dysfunction of the methylation cycle. The synthetic folic acid that we get from "fortified foods" (thanks to the health "geniuses" in government food regulating agencies) and shoddy multivitamin supplements sold in white plastic bottles prevent our bodies from methylating properly. You may not carry problematic MTHFR genes, but if you're struggling with infertility, your methylation probably has something to do with that. Fertility doctors report multitudinous cases of women who dealt with infertility for years but finally got pregnant and gave birth when they made an effort to remove folic acid from their diets.The epigenetic vitamin came up a lot in the expert's recommendations for addressing fertility challenges. Supplementing it is a pretty good idea for almost everybody; if you have a smartphone and Wifi, those EMFs are causing breaks in your sperm or egg's DNA daily, and Niacin fuels your body's DNA repair system, PARP. You'll get a bigger biological bang for your supplementation buck by taking the non-flush stuff (you'll get used to the flush), NR, or NMN. - a placebo that might deliver you a little bundle of joy?\
I came across an interesting 2022 meta-analysis on Acupuncture as an infertility treatment, which crunched the statistically significant data of 27 randomized controlled trials totaling over 7000 human subjects. Good news: it found Acupuncture to be broadly helpful in treating infertility and improving live birth rates. However, in the meta-analysis, true Acupuncture did not outperform sham Acupuncture by much…We found clear advantages of acupuncture over blank control conditions in terms of the live birth rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and clinical pregnancy rate. However, these effects were similar between the true and sham acupuncture groups, and the rate of adverse events was lower in the sham group than in the true acupuncture group.\
So it's yet another case of the pragmatic Biohacker's best friend, the placebo effect, working its magic! Thousands of women went into Acupuncture offices, got pricked with some needles, believed it was helping their fertility, and had more live births than the blank controls. So, I'm convinced that Acupuncture is worth adding to the motivated couple's fertility optimization stack.At the time of publication of this article, I'm still waiting on my own whole genome sequencing due to a mix-up with the international shipping of my kit. In its current form, this article is based on cross-referencing my wife's whole genome sequencing with my rigorous research on the topic of fertility-related genes. So expect an update and follow-up when I get mine done. Join our newsletter and subscribe to the Limitless Mindset channel, podcast, or Substack to get that follow-up (and to stay on the cutting edge with the latest in Biohacking, longevity, and lifehacking).\
Cross-referencing your genome by common infertility-causing conditions and genes may very well reveal the needle in the haystack you need to find to put "unexplained infertility" behind you. However, genetics is complicated, and employing the counsel of a genetic counselor is wise for this journey.\
If you've been a long-time reader of mine, I hope you pick up the through line in my writing and research. From social dynamics hacks, picking up chicks, salsa dancing, and the weird and wacky relationship hacks I write about that have kept my marriage a happy one for nearly seven years now. To epigenetic optimization for taking back your destiny, precision Biohacking with personal genotyping, and my optimistic accelerationist vision for the future of mankind on this planet. It's all about making better little humans whose brilliance, one day, will scarcely be outshone by the cosmos. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How 3D-Printed Sound Panels Can Absorb Noise More Efficiently</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-3d-printed-sound-panels-can-absorb-noise-more-efficiently?source=rss</link><author>Labyrinthine</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[4 Rainbow AM labyrinthine panel5 Numerical evaluation of different labyrinthine sound absorption panel solutions2 Unit cell design and analysisIn conventional ideal fluid environments, sound propagation is typically described by a lossless wave equation [32–34]. However, when fluids are confined in small regions, like narrow tubes or slits, it becomes necessary to account for structural losses [30,33,34]. There are two primary loss mechanisms: thermal losses, primarily arising from heat diffusion at the boundaries within the sound field, and viscous losses, due to friction with the UC walls. These physical dissipation mechanisms effectively absorb sound energy, leading to perfect absorption when they are balanced by the acoustic energy leakage by radiation from the UC: the matching of the two corresponds to the critical coupling condition [33,35].\
The type of labyrinthine geometry considered in this work (Fig. 1a) is a first-iteration Wunderlich curve [36], which corresponds to a quarter-wave resonator. This design can be studied using narrow tube thermo-viscous loss models to derive its absorption properties. In particular, the designed aperture (Fig. 1a) is responsible both for the losses and energy leakage of the UC, while the cavity (Fig. 1b) is only responsible for the losses. The considered UC can be modelled as a tube with constant cross section 𝑤 × 𝑡, and a rigid backing (Fig. 1c) as pointed out by several works [37–39]. In particular, given the subwavelength size of the system, the equivalent tube can be described as a narrow duct, following the Stinson’s approximation for thermo-viscous losses [40], while the inlet can be studied as a perforated plate using the Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model, as described in [37].(1) F.

Mechanisms and HeterogeneityC.14. Mechanisms: Slant contagion and polarizationHere, we replicate Table 4, but instead of pre-FNC/MSNBC era newspaper endorsements, we distinguish observations by the county-level Republican vote share terciles (lowest tercile in the first column, second tercile in middle, and highest tercile in the last column). Qualitatively, we find the same pattern: The relative FNC exposure coefficient is negative in the first column, positive plus relatively small in the second column (coefficients in columns 1 and 2 are not significant), before turning significant, positive, and large in the last column.(1) Philine Widmer, ETH Zürich and philine.widmer@gess.ethz.ch;(2) Sergio Galletta, ETH Zürich and sergio.galletta@gess.ethz.ch;(3) Elliott Ash, ETH Zürich and ashe@ethz.ch.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are the Effects of Contagious Media Slant Driven by Supply or Demand?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/are-the-effects-of-contagious-media-slant-driven-by-supply-or-demand?source=rss</link><author>Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 03:12:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[6. Mechanisms and HeterogeneityC.13. Mechanisms: Descriptive Evidence on Demand SideA relevant question is whether the effects of contagious slant are driven by supply or demand – that is, a direct influence on news producers, or else theirs response to changes in reader preferences. Newspaper readers, influenced by their cable news consumption, might demand more slanted news content. On the supply side, owners, editors, or journalists exposed to certain channels may borrow the associated slanted content and push it to consumers.\
The previous literature has produced mixed evidence, with some work showing that slant across U.S. newspapers reflects the political preferences of readers rather than producers (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010), while other work has shown that media owners do influence news content (Gilens and Hertzman, 2000; Martin and McCrain, 2019; Mastrorocco and Ornaghi, 2020; Szeidl and Szucs, 2021). Given the declining revenues in the local news industry during the 2005-2008 time period (Evans, 2009; Rolnik et al., 2019; Djourelova et al., 2021), it could be that newspapers have less leeway to deviate from consumer preferences in favor of producer preferences. On the other hand, lower revenues might also reduce newsmaking resources. Then, borrowing content from national platforms may provide a cheap production alternative to original reporting.\
The features of the institutional setting make direct influence of journalists, either through production costs or ideological preferences, a less likely or at least less salient mechanism for the observed 2SLS effects. A journalist can easily access cable news and borrow material, regardless of the local channel position (assuming that journalists are relatively sophisticated news consumers). Martin and Yurukoglu (2017) discuss this issue in the context of voting, where one would expect cable news to influence swing voters who don’t have a strong partisan commitment. Ash and Poyker (2019) make a similar point for judges: cable news influences criminal sentencing through voters and judicial elections rather than persuading judges directly.\
Here, we provide some descriptive evidence on the demand side by comparing the effects of cable-channel exposure on news content to the parallel effects on Republican vote share documented in previous work (Martin and Yurukoglu, 2017; Ash et al., 2021). If the contagious-slant effects are driven by responses to a cable news-induced demand shift among readers, we would expect newspapers to react most in counties where the FNC effect on Republican voting is the largest. To test for this possibility, we use a machine-learning approach to model heterogeneous treatment effects across counties in the response to the channel-position instrument. This generalized model – a causal forest from Athey et al. (2019) – allows the reduced form effect of channel position to vary flexibly with local covariates. After collapsing the data to the county level, we train two models – one with newspaper slant as the outcome and a second with 2008 Republican vote share as the outcome.\
Using the trained causal forests, we predict county-specific treatment effects for both outcomes. Figure C.6 shows that the predicted effect sizes for each outcome are highly correlated across counties (with a Pearson’s correlation of 0.25). Further, Table C.16 shows that similar covariates predict a strong response for both news similarity and Republican vote share. Overall, these findings suggest that the types of counties who are responsive to cable news exposure in their voting are also responsive in the associated news content similarity. We interpret this result as descriptive evidence for the relative importance of demand-side effects.\

Mechanisms and HeterogeneityC.12. Mechanisms: Language features and topics\
In Table C.14, re-run our main specification, but instead of bigram-based similarity with FNC, we regress vocabulary size (normalized by the total size of the corpus, column 1), average word length (column 2), average sentence length (column 3), and average article length (column 4) on instrumented FNC viewership relative to MSNBC and CNN. As before, we include demographic and channel controls. We also account for the size of the newspaper-specific corpus. [22] None of the coefficients are significant or close to significant. These results are consistent with the interpretation that our main results are driven by FNC-specific bigrams that diffuse into local newspaper content. [23][22] The number of articles scraped is given by the availability on NewsLibrary. It does not seem to follow a pattern: the correlation between corpus size and circulation by newspaper is rather small, around 0.3. The correlation between similarity with FNC and corpus size is, if anything, negative (around -0.21).\
[23] The insignificance of the coefficients in Table C.14 should not come as a surprise given that the main results in Table 2 barely change when we move from column 2 to column 3 (where generic newspaper language controls are introduced).(1) Philine Widmer, ETH Zürich and philine.widmer@gess.ethz.ch;(2) Sergio Galletta, ETH Zürich and sergio.galletta@gess.ethz.ch;(3) Elliott Ash, ETH Zürich and ashe@ethz.ch.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Let&apos;s Take a Look at Fox News Channel&apos;s Viewership</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/lets-take-a-look-at-fox-news-channels-viewership?source=rss</link><author>Tech Media Bias [Research Publication]</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 02:44:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[6.
