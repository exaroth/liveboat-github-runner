These films and shows have created a romanticized image of the Mafia—made men who rose from nothing to rule over powerful crime families. It’s all about money, power, loyalty, and a paradoxical code of honor.

But how much of this is fact, and how much is fiction? In this video, we dive into the myths created by Hollywood and compare them to the real-world history of organized crime.

💬 Share your thoughts in the comments: Which Mafia movie or TV series is your favorite? How close do you think Hollywood comes to the truth?

Animal welfare focuses on animals’ well-being, particularly of those under human care or ownership. Protection laws aim to ensure that animals’ physical, mental, and environmental needs are met, while allowing their owners to make use of them (for food or labor, for example) without inflicting any “unnecessary suffering.”   

Advocates of animal rights, on the other hand, believe animals should be legally protected from all forms of exploitation. Many proponents say people should not be allowed to farm animals, use them in laboratories, injure or kill them. 

Both views are based on the idea that most animals are sentient beings, which can think and feel and therefore have personal interests which should be respected.

On Monday, over a trillion dollars was wiped off the US stock market due to the appearance of a Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek.

The release of a new reasoning model, known as R1, led investors to question US dominance in tech, their expectations around future AI capex while also raising the prospect that China might beat Silicon Valley at its own game.

The new DeepSeek model can “reason” to solve complex problems and performs as well as the AI software from US tech giants like Google and OpenAI, but was apparently developed at a fraction of the price of those models.

DeepSeek quickly overtook OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the US iOS App store.

Two images of child rape are shared online every second. Social networks make it especially easy for sex offenders to prey on victims.

Back in 2009, the United Nations estimated that 750,000 pedophiles were online at any one time. Fifteen years later, experts believe that figure has tripled. Believing themselves to be shielded by the apparent anonymity of chatrooms, these men - most of the perpetrators are men - exchange ideas on how best to approach and manipulate a child into supplying explicit material.
They also give each other tips on how to rape a child known to them and share images with others without being caught. Some enquire about commissioning the rape of a child to their exact specifications on the other side of the world - and to witness this live via Skype or WhatsApp for less than a hundred dollars. 
A nightmare that is part of everyday life for child protection organizations and law enforcement agencies, who are faced with the challenge of identifying victims of abuse, tracking down the perpetrators and preventing the proliferation of pedocriminal content.
For four years, director Laetitia Ohnona observed the day-to-day work of relevant agencies in Germany, France, Britain, North America and the Philippines: accompanying French police from the new central office for the protection of minors, undercover American special agents from the Homeland Security Investigations agency,  the Public Prosecutor General’s Office in Frankfurt and German police officers responsible for taking down darknet pages, as well as employees of reporting platforms tracking down pedocriminal content. On a visit to the European Commission, she learned that it plans to impose stricter rules on IT companies.

ABSTRACT
The software industry is changing faster than ever. Now, with microservices becoming more and more accepted as an approach to systems architecture, the rate of change of our industry and of the software we write is getting faster and faster.

In this talk, James explores what this means for developers writing code now. Do we abandon our quest to build quality in? What does it mean for design if we are building software explicitly to throw it away a short time later. Is TDD dead? What does software craftsmanship look like through the lens of replaceable code in small replaceable services?

In short, what does it mean if we are #neverdone?

For some people, it gets in the way of taking risks and living the life they dream of. For others, it keeps them trapped in negative feelings. The stronger the shame, the more we try to hide it from others.

This is precisely what gives shame so much destructive power over us. In this documentary, three people tell their stories. They share their personal experiences, and the consequences of their shame: Addiction, self-harm, depression. Experts explain why we feel ashamed in the first place, how shame influences our self-image and how we can find a way out of this painful feeling. 

Because shame hurts. At the same time, shame is crucial to helping us to live together. Shame turns us into social beings, who have internalized the norms and rules of the community. To what extent shame benefits coexistence is also a topic of research. In view of social media, do we need more shame, as a moral cement, so that we behave more respectfully towards each other? Or would less shame be better?

The story of Chrissy Teigen’s paternal great-grandparents was largely unknown to her. Research determines that she is descended from multiple generations of musicians, and from the Sinti people, a subgroup of the Romani people. The Roma, or Romani people were often denigrated as Gypsies, but it explains why Teigen’s ancestors moved so often.

Chrissy Teigen is a New York Times #1 bestselling author, TV personality and the founder of food and lifestyle brand Cravings. In 2016, Teigen released “Cravings: Recipes for All the Food You Want to Eat” which debuted #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list and marked the first time a cookbook debuted #1 on USA Today's best-seller list. Teigen cohosted and executive produced “Chrissy & Dave Dine Out” with David Chang. She also executive produced and starred in “Chrissy’s Court”, executive produced the HBO Max documentary series “The Way Down”, and starred opposite Tina Fey and Nat Faxon in the Netflix animated comedy series “Mulligan”.

ABSTRACT
Playwright is the hottest browser automation tool on the market. You can use it for testing and web scraping, but also for production monitoring!

In this talk I’ll explain the basics of Playwright, show real life (code) examples and explain how to use browser automation for effective, high signal to noise production monitoring: I like to call this the “monitoring as code” workflow. After this talk, you will have the basic knowledge on using Playwright in your own dev pipeline and catch errors on production. [...]

Our ability to learn about phenomena and worlds that seem almost
impossibly out of reach, now give us an incredible insight into the universe we occupy, and how we got here.

Brian and Robin find out about some of the big new missions providing information into our own solar system and beyond, and find out what big questions in cosmology still remain a tantalising challenge?

According to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.

This film’s protagonists are united by the challenges, suffering and constant change they face - as well as by their confidence that things will turn out well in the end.

When Lend Mustafa loses his mother, he plunges into a deep crisis. She was his most important support as he embarked on a difficult journey: Lend had decided to live not as a woman, but as a trans man. Not an easy decision in the patriarchal Kosovar society in which Lend lives. But Lend stays true to his decision and goes on to open a club in Kosovo for the queer community. 
Ekaterina Straijewa is also familiar with the challenges of living in a patriarchal society. In Bulgaria, she was a successful racing driver. Despite her success, she faced ridicule for being a woman on the racetrack. Then an assault forced her to give up her profession. Her whole life was thrown into question. But she manages to fight her way back and climbs into the cockpit once again. 
Bashkim Lilo grew up in the Albanian mountains and worked as a shepherd. When he was offered the opportunity to train as a nursing assistant, he jumped at the chance. Because it was clear to him that this was the only way he and his family would have a future in Albania.

DESCRIPTION
In this episode of the "GOTO Book Club", Nicola Corti talks to Marcin Moskala, author of "Effective Kotlin", to unravel the inspiration, evolution, and community impact of his work.

Moskala reflects on his decade-long journey with Kotlin, revealing how his book bridges the gap between Java-centric practices and Kotlin’s idiomatic potential. The discussion spans essential topics like factory functions, composition over inheritance, and the iterative process behind curating best practices tailored to Kotlin’s strengths.

Marcin also highlights the "Kotlin for Developers" series and his Give IT Forward initiative, showcasing his commitment to empowering developers and fostering accessible programming education worldwide.

Join historians, survivors and experts as they consider one of the great moral dilemmas of the 20th century. Should the Allies have risked killing Auschwitz prisoners and bombed the camp to stop future atrocities?

In April 1944, Jewish prisoners Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler miraculously escaped from Auschwitz concentration camp and fled through Nazi-occupied Poland to find refuge in Žilina, Slovakia, where they connected with the Jewish Underground. Once safe, they recounted what they left behind. Their harrowing testimony revealed the true horror of the Holocaust to the outside world, describing in forensic detail the gas chambers and the full extent of the Nazi extermination program.

While millions of troops fought on both fronts and battled for supremacy in the air during World War II, Nazi forces continued to deport Jews to the concentration camp.  As Vrba and Wetzler’s account made its way to Allies, the idea of bombing the camp was discussed at the highest levels of government. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Allied Air Commanders, the American War Refugee Board and the Jewish Agency were presented with one of the greatest moral questions of the 20th century: Should we bomb Auschwitz and risk killing Jewish prisoners in the camp to stop future atrocities?

If those losses continued, Britain could lose a quarter of its fleet within the year and might just be starved out of the war.  
Yet, just a few years later, everything had changed. By 1943, German U-boats had gone from predator to prey, as the Allies took full control of Atlantic Ocean. So how did they do it? 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest campaign of the Second World War, running continuously from the first days, right up until the defeat of Nazi Germany 6 years later. 

In this video, IWM Curator Robert Rumble explores the race to victory in the Atlantic through the lens of war winning technologies, and objects on display at IWM Duxford, and IWM London.

Drug trafficking and corruption reign.

The Seychelles, renowned for its white sandy beaches and crystal-clear waters, seems like the perfect vacation destination.
