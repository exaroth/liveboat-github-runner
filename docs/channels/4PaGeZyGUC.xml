Last weekend Donald Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 per cent levy on imports from China. Canadian oil was hit at a lower rate of 10 per cent. The duties will take effect from Tuesday. Just days later these tariffs were suspended.

Trump said the actions were in response to the “major threat” posed by the flow of migrants and drugs into the US across its borders with Canada and Mexico.

Is our perception of reality just an illusion? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Gary O’Reilly explore the neuroscience behind magic with magician Teller (of Penn & Teller) and neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde.

We dive into the world of sensory perception, illusions, and the tricks magicians use to exploit the brain’s blind spots. How do our brains construct reality rather than simply perceiving it? Susana breaks down the science behind misdirection and cognitive illusions, revealing how our minds take shortcuts that magicians cleverly manipulate. Why haven’t we evolved to see through magic tricks? What role does survival play in shaping how we perceive the world?

What happens when you don’t notice changes right in front of you? We explore how magicians, like scientists, seek to understand the limits of human cognition. From change blindness to attentional blindness, we discuss how magic tricks exploit cognitive gaps. How does humor help magicians distract an audience? What can neuroscience learn from the study of stage magic?

We also examine the ethical questions surrounding magic and deception. Should magicians expose fraudulent psychics who exploit belief? Can illusions help teach critical thinking? Plus, learn where the rabbit coming out of the top hat came from and other magic lore.

The most populous city in Israel is a holy place for Christians, Jews and Muslims. And claims to its historic sites are the subject of furious dispute between Israelis and Palestinians.

The documentary sheds light on the political and religious background to the conflict over Jerusalem and places the current events in their historical context. Those involved have their say and experts comment on the current situation. Hamas named its 7 October terrorist attack on Israel ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ in reference to the famous Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
In doing so, the Islamists are once again focusing global attention on the Holy City. Both sides lay claim to the Temple Mount, a place of religious significance for both communities. This is why Jerusalem has always been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontation. Middle East experts agree on one point: without a solution for Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim as the capital of their state, or possible future state, this conflict will not be resolved.
The documentary, which was made after 7 October, investigates one of the most profound conflicts of our time. It explores invisible borders, sheds light on the failed UN partition plan and tells of the eternal battle for the holy sites on Temple Mount. The film depicts a city where people co-exist without hatred, where a modern ‘start-up nation’ rubs shoulders with ancient culture - and where hope has not yet been completely extinguished.

ABSTRACT
There’s no such thing as the perfect programming language. I’m sorry, but there isn’t, and I’ll explain why.

On the other hand, if you were set the task of designing the perfect language, how close could you get, how would you go about it, and what would it look like in the end? We’re going to explore this problem space with a tour along the bleeding edge of modern language design, giving you some insight into what’s already out there, what tradeoffs each new idea comes with, and what sort of tools you might be working with in a future where programming is slightly less awful than it is today.

José Andrés discovers that his great-great-grandmother, Oracia, was abandoned as a child and left to nuns. Most abandoned children at that time did not fare well, but Oracia beat the odds, being adopted by a mystery couple who set her up with financial stability. She would later marry, start a family -- and open a bakery -- an ambition that chef José shares!

Twice named one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People” and awarded “Outstanding Chef” and “Humanitarian of the Year” by the James Beard Foundation, José Andrés is an internationally recognized humanitarian, culinary innovator, New York Times bestselling author, educator, Emmy-winning television personality, and owner of the award-winning José Andrés Group, which operates nearly 40 restaurants in the US and beyond. In 2010, Andrés founded World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit organization that is first to the frontlines of crises. Andrés’ many distinctions included the 2015 National Humanities Medal, the 2017 Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals, and the Princess of Asturias Foundation’s 2021 Concordia Prize for his humanitarian work. In 2023, Andrés founded the Global Food Institute at George Washington University in Washington DC.

A heroine, forgotten by history, who fearlessly saved Jewish lives. The name of her husband Oskar Schindler became synonymous with acts of compassion and humanity in the Nazi era. But what role did his wife Emilie Schindler play?

Filmmaker Annette Baumeister tells the story of Emilie Schindler, who protected people without attracting much attention. After the war, Emilie was abandoned by her husband and forgotten by the world. 

Emilie Pelzl was born in the Sudetenland in 1907. From an early age, she worked on her parents' farm and cared for relatives. At the age of 20, she fell in love with the charming Oskar Schindler. Although he was considered a heartbreaker, she married him. Oskar had affairs and squandered the dowry, but Emilie stuck by him. During World War Two, the Schindlers ran factories and employed Jewish workers - saving many of them from the death camps.

In this documentary, Emilie Schindler's Argentinian carer Leandro Coseforti, her niece Traude Ferrari, and historians all describe a forgotten heroine. Annette Baumeister sensitively reconstructs Emilie Schindler's life, bringing her out of her husband's shadow. 

The film draws a picture of a woman who risked her life to help others. By procuring food and medicine for those in need, she helped to rescue many Jewish people right under the noses of the SS.

Fingerprints have long been known to be completely unique. They also don’t change their pattern over your lifetime, making them an extremely useful biometric for identification. Their uniqueness largely comes from how they form in the womb: as waves of skin cells growing in random patterns of ridges under the top layer of skin in our hands and feet.

Fingerprints are so unique that it is considered impossible to match two different fingerprints from the same person — the only way to know for sure is to match a fingerprint to the exact finger. But a new AI tool developed by students at Columbia University says there are more similarities in intra-person, or same person, fingerprints than we’ve previously known.

Between 1947 and 1967, black-owned homes in Birmingham, Alabama were bombed over 50 times. Homes on Center Street were targeted so often, the neighborhood became known as ‘Dynamite Hill.’ What happened on Center Street is a scar on American history, but the voices of Dynamite Hill speak with strength and grace about how they faced unimaginable hatred, with one repeated refrain: “I’m still here.”

Well we can! Thanks to the extraordinary work of the artist hans Holbein the Younger.

Professor Suzannah Lipscomb goes to Buckingham Palace to enter the gallery of the Royal Collection where a brilliant exhibition of Hans Holbein’s works takes us to the very heart of life in the Tudor court - meeting the men and women who witnessed and changed history, Anne Boleyn, Thomas More, Jane Seymour.  Thanks to the amazingly characterful drawings of Hans Holbein the Younger we can look them in the eye, weigh them up, consider their motives. 

Suzannah explores the movers and shakers of Henry VIII’s inner circle - including one very special Holbein portrait that could be of Anne Boleyn herself, captured in a reflective and intimate moment. Experts have long debated whether it could be Anne at the time she was queen.  Now Suzannah and Royal Collections curator Kate Heard discuss the evidence and reach a thrilling conclusion. 

And there are other stars of the Tudor world here too - Thomas More, the great humanist, lawyer and politician; Thomas Wyatt, the mercurial diplomat ; as well as lesser known people like Frances De Vere, a dynamic woman captured on paper by Holbein’s genius.

Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

But a Bloomberg investigation reveals that several private hospital companies funded by the IFC have kept patients in their care until they can cover their bills or otherwise satisfy the hospital they will be able to pay. This policy can, at times, keep people from going home many days after they are medically ready for discharge. One healthcare company in the Philippines says it’s just following the law.

Using modern genetic techniques, they’re extracting ancient genetic material from museum exhibits. Do their efforts represent hope for the future of the natural world? Or is science playing God?

Findings in the thawed permafrost of Siberia have made it possible to reconstruct the DNA of mammoths. Researchers are now experimenting with inserting genes related to the ability to resist cold temperatures into the Asian elephant, which is related to the mammoth. The animals thus created could survive in the steppes of Siberia and Alaska. 

In Australia, scientists have managed to extract the genetic material of marsupial wolves from preserved embryos in museums. The predator’s genes are replicated in the lab and implanted into the related marsupial mouse - in a bid to bring the extinct creature back to life. 

And biotechnology could also help white rhinos in Africa: Researchers in Berlin are fertilizing eggs from the last two living females with sperm from deceased males frozen and preserved for decades. 

However, these practices are also attracting criticism. Biology researchers question the usefulness of revived species for natural habitats. They fear that the excitement surrounding the idea of bringing back extinct species could distract people from the many problems that cause animals to disappear, in the first place. Are some scientists playing God - with unforeseeable consequences for the environment?

Should we receive compensation for our organs?

--

This is episode 2 of the animated series, “Ada.” This 5-episode narrative follows the young library assistant Ada as she juggles two worlds: her daily mundane reality and the future she vividly imagines for all humanity. Traveling through her visions of potential futures, Ada grapples with the ethical and social implications of new technologies and how they could shape the world.

The Rwandan government mobilized the country’s Hutu population to attack members of the Tutsi minority and anyone who opposed. In just 100 days, around one million people were killed. 
 
30 years after the genocide, Rwandans are trying to move forward. In "reconciliation villages", convicted perpetrators, who have been released from prison, survivors of the genocide and their children live side by side and try to deal with the past.

Uncover new archaeological evidence rewriting our understanding of the Dark Ages in 5th- and 6th-century Britain that might also explain the legend of King Arthur. [Originally aired in 2019]

After four centuries of occupation and leadership, the Romans left Britain in 410 AD and the island’s fate was left hanging in the balance. History teaches that in the 5th century, the country descended into a tumultuous and violent period known as the Dark Ages, leaving the nation vulnerable to invading Angle and Saxon hordes from northern Europe. With a nation divided, a great leader known as King Arthur emerged, uniting the lawless lands to fight off invaders – or at least that’s what the fragmentary historical texts suggest. The truth is, no one really knows what happened, and this pivotal moment in history has been shrouded in mystery – until now.

#JoyRidePBS

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
