By the early 20th century, Imperial Japan had established itself as the dominant force in Asia. Through ruthless military conquests, the small island nation greatly expanded its borders. The rising imperial power soon set its sights on conquering much of East Asia. By 1921, nearly a third of Japan’s national budget was dedicated to building one of the most powerful navies in the world.

In response to Japan and other world powers rapidly expanding their naval strength, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922 to impose restrictions on the size and number of warships. However, American military planners were not convinced—rightfully so—that Imperial Japan would adhere to these new restrictions for very long. The United States, surrounded by two enormous oceans, seemed increasingly vulnerable. 

In War Plan Orange (first outlined in 1919 and revised in subsequent years), military planners devised strategies for a possible war with Imperial Japan. Particular attention was given to key targets like the United States' West Coast, Pearl Harbor, and the vital Suez Canal. With millions of square kilometers of open Pacific Ocean, it was possible for the Imperial Japanese Navy to go undetected for weeks before launching a surprise attack. Scout cruisers were the U.S. Navy’s primary means of searching for enemy fleets, but they were too slow, too few in number, and too costly to adequately cover the vast Pacific. Aircraft of the era also lacked the range to scout large sections of the ocean. In response, Admiral William A. Moffett, Chief of the U.S. Bureau of Aeronautics, advocated for a radical alternative.

Under Moffett's direction, the United States began experimenting with rigid airships in 1923. Airships appeared to be the ideal solution for enhancing the Navy’s long-range scouting capabilities. As "scout cruisers of the air," airships combined the extended range of surface vessels with speeds nearly as fast as aircraft. The Navy’s first two rigid airships, the USS Shenandoah (ZR-1) and USS Los Angeles (ZR-3), helped pioneer the operational intricacies of airship use in a military setting. Navy crews trained for long-range day missions and practiced mooring to ships at sea to replenish fuel and helium. The Navy also perfected the practice of carrying, launching, and recovering aircraft in mid-flight, which was considered vital for airship defense.

In 1929, construction began on two of the largest airships the world had ever seen: the USS Akron (ZRS-4) and the USS Macon (ZRS-5). Defended by machine guns and equipped with internal hangars capable of carrying five Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters, these airships were scouting warships in every sense. If they proved successful, there were plans to build at least a dozen more to help patrol the vast Pacific Ocean and keep America safe.

Almost unthinkable in India. But Prateek Reen does it -- in Munich. This film shows the journey of a young woman from an Indian mountain village to Bavaria.

She will never forget how poor her family once was, after they lost everything in a fire. She has experienced the world as fleeting and fragile. But Prateek Reen also knows that you can take a recipe with you, on a small piece of paper. A memory. The taste of freedom. And that you can use it to create a new world in a foreign country. In Germany, she did just that, with her own restaurant, called "Madam Chutney”.

ABSTRACT
In this talk & demo, we have a look at some of the low-hanging problems in general aviation and how functional programming can be applied to provide significant improvements in efficiency and air safety. The current solutions to problems such as navigation, traffic/terrain collision avoidance and weight/balance calculations will be demonstrated to the audience, mostly for amusement. More seriously, we will have a look at the legacy that has led to the way things are, and how to improve by applying our programming skills.

We will look at:
• how aviation safety is regulated.
• how aeronautical services are provided to flight operators.
• how aeronautical navigation is conducted and regulated.
• how the weight and balance for a flight is conducted.
• the methods by which aircraft and ground coordinate between each other.

We will see:
• some real (and basic) data management problems in aviation, that very obviously threaten safety, then solve them, using programming.
• we will see a live demonstration of aeronautical navigation methods, investigate incident reports where lives were lost as a result, and consider how our programming skills can yield improvements, possibly even save lives.
• we will conduct a real weight&balance calculation for a flight, then once hilarity inevitably ensues, we will look at the problems that arise by this method, then solve them using data structures and functional programming. Some of these practical problems are obvious, even to a non-aviator, and the predictable incident reports are the end result.
• finally, we will have a look at a live demonstration of a software defined radio (SDR), receiving ADS-B transmissions from aircraft (live), an #AHRS implementation and #GNSS receiver using off-the-shelf, low-cost parts. We will look at why these instruments are helpful to aircraft pilots and interact with that device using the #Haskell programming language.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-hosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly dive into the mysteries of consciousness with neuroscientist and author Anil Seth, professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex and author of Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. Together, they explore questions surrounding the nature of our minds, the boundaries of intelligence, and humanity's place in the universe.

Is consciousness unique to humans, or could it extend to animals, machines, or even the mycelium networks beneath our feet? The conversation navigates through philosophical debates, scientific discoveries, and the evolving theories of consciousness, touching on topics like panpsychism, the fuzzy line between intelligence and awareness, and why it’s so hard to pin down what makes you “you.” From Descartes’ “beast machines” to Darwin’s revelations about our interconnectedness with other species, they challenge long-held notions of human specialness. 

Will AI ever cross into consciousness, or are we simply moving the goalposts? Will artificial intelligence ever achieve consciousness—or even surpass us? They weigh in on the feasibility of uploading minds, the limits of silicon-based intelligence, and the implications of brain organoids—tiny, lab-grown neural tissues. They discuss the singularity, techbro optimism, and whether humanity is destined for a post-biological age. Throughout, we are reminded to ask not just what consciousness is but what it does for us—and why it matters.

The continent’s total gas reserves are almost as large as those of the US. But will local people actually benefit from the export of gas, as hoped?

Europe is looking for new gas producers. This is because Russia’s war against Ukraine has highlighted Europe's and especially Germany's dependence on Russian gas. One possible solution is to increase gas imports from Africa, which already account for around a fifth of the gas used in Europe.

Mozambique in southern Africa is expected to become the third largest African exporter of liquefied natural gas. Senegal in West Africa is also seen as a major future gas supplier. 

What does this development mean for the people of Mozambique and Senegal? Will they actually benefit from gas exports as hoped? Can the utilization of gas reserves create new jobs and help to reduce migration from Senegal to Europe? 

So far, the gas sector in Mozambique has led to conflict rather than prosperity. Is a turnaround in sight? Or is African gas coming too late to be relevant for European climate neutrality targets?

ABSTRACT
What are the characteristics of a good software engineer? It's a topic many people would argue endlessly about. This is not surprising given we are effectively living in the era of software alchemy. Some of the best programmers draw on strong scientific and engineering background and combine this with craft like coding skills in a virtuous feedback cycle.

In this talk we explore the individual practices and techniques that can help bring out the engineer in you.

Rita Dove learns about her great-grandfather's criminal charges and trying adulthood. He was acquitted on an assault charge, but later in life, after a name change, was charged with operating a speakeasy during Prohibition.

Poet and essayist Rita Dove was awarded the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for her third poetry book, "Thomas and Beulah". She received the 1996 National Humanities Medal from President Clinton and the 2011 National Medal of Arts from President Obama – the only poet honored with both White House recognitions. From 1993 to 1995 she served as U.S. Poet Laureate. Born in 1952 in Akron, Ohio, Dove has authored ten volumes of poetry and received 29 honorary doctorates among numerous other accolades.

She has no active memory of the time she spent there. For more than 70 years, her past and her family’s fate played no role in her life.

But when she suffered a heart attack at the age of 74, she realized that she had to come to terms with this part of her life. 

Eva Umlauf was two years old, emaciated and extremely ill when the Red Army liberated the Auschwitz camp on January 27, 1945. 

Her mother returned with her two daughters to her father's birthplace, near Bratislava. Everyone else in the family was dead. A shadow of trauma lay over Eva’s young life.

During her medical studies, she met her first husband Jakob, a Polish Jew, and followed him to Munich. She found happiness and security at his side.

But a few years later, Jakob died in a tragic accident. Eva was left on her own to fend for herself and her young son. Eventually, she remarried and had two more sons. 

Later in life, her past suddenly caught up with her. She decided to consciously confront it, to give her children and grandchildren a life less burdened by the past.

ABSTRACT
Aaron is at the forefront of shaping the standards that govern online authentication. In this session, Aaron will share his insights into the evolving landscape of identity and access management, highlighting key trends, challenges, and best practices. Drawing on his experience as the editor of OAuth 2.1 and other specifications, Aaron will discuss the future of OAuth and its impact on developers and security professionals.

This session will cover everything from the origins of OAuth to protect users from having to share their credentials with third-party apps, to modern-day uses of OAuth ranging everywhere from advanced token exchange use cases to being the underpinnings of secure identity in the enterprise. Expect takeaways on securing applications at scale and understanding the next generation of identity protocols. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Tod Golding, author of "Building Multi-Tenant SaaS Architectures (https://amzn.to/3YfM49o) ", discusses the critical need for collaboration between business and technical roles in organizations adopting a SaaS model with Bill Tarr. He advocates for a top-down vision that encourages non-technical roles, such as finance and operations, to engage deeply with technical teams, fostering a service mindset rather than a sole focus on product features.

Tod highlights the importance of operational insights in multi-tenant environments, where effective monitoring of tenant behaviors is essential to prevent issues before they impact customers. He also discusses the evolving role of GenAI within SaaS, noting its potential to deliver tailored experiences while leveraging shared resources for economies of scale.

Looking ahead, Tod envisions a future where SaaS architectures become simpler, more efficient, and broadly applicable across various industries, with advancements in compliance, security, and tenant isolation facilitating wider adoption.

--

Moore’s Law states that every 1 to 2 years the number of transistors that can fit on a given size computer chip will double. Thanks to this law, chips have gotten smaller, faster, more efficient, and cheaper. But today, there are four key problems that trip up this trend, potentially ending Moore’s Law and fundamentally changing how computing progresses. Sajan Saini and George Zaidan investigate.

According to reports, minors are being sexually exploited in many bars in the red -light district. 

A DW documentary on sex tourism in Pattaya unleashed a wave of outrage after it was broadcast at the end of 2023. Thailand's national media picked up the story, focused on the case of a suspected German pedophile who managed to leave the country.

Follow historian James Holland on his quest to understand how the use of amphetamines affected the course of World War II and unleashed the first pharmacological arms race. [Originally aired in 2019]

Stories about drug use by Hitler and German forces during World War II have been widely told. What’s less well known is the Allied commanders’ embraced pharmacological “force enhancers” as well.  By 1941, rumors about Nazi soldiers using a “super-drug” identified as the methamphetamine Pervitin were confirmed, and Allied commanders launched their own classified program to find the perfect war-fighting drug.

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Documented terror - Where are Syria&apos;s missing prisoners? | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptuDWhSTFl0</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ptuDWhSTFl0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2025 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Burns, strangulation, broken bones. The list of signs of torture is long and can be seen on some 27,000 photos showing dead Syrian civilians. The man who smuggled the photos out of the country calls himself "Caesar”.

During the long decades of the Assad regime, hundreds of thousands of people disappeared inside its torture centers.  For years, "Caesar” worked as a photographer for the Syrian military, taking pictures of civilians tortured to death and documenting their cases. Who are the dead, what was their fate, and why did they disappear? Throughout Europe, the families of the victims, supported by international lawyers, activists and Caesar himself, are searching for truth and justice. They are investigating the Syrian death machine and the actions of its officials. Before the collapse of the regime in December 2024, this was both difficult and dangerous, there was always the risk that investigations based abroad could endanger further the lives of those behind Assad’s bars.

It had a relatively low velocity gun, it was rumoured to burst into flames at a moments notice and was seen to be inferior to German heavy tanks. But is the Sherman's notoriety deserved?

In this video, IWM's John Delaney will examine the M4 Sherman in the round. He'll look at the tank's design, what it was produced to do, and how it compared to its German equivalents. Plus he'll examine some of the Sherman's forgotten attributes which outclassed even the heaviest German tanks.

As a result we'll gain a more nuanced view and a better appreciation of just how effective the Sherman was in the Second World War.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​

Coming after an unprecedented campaign season that saw Trump’s felony conviction in a “hush money” case, multiple assassination attempts against him, and President Joe Biden’s exit from the race just four months before the election, “Trump’s Comeback” tells the story of Trump’s return to the presidency, overcoming obstacles and opposition.

The film investigates how Trump’s comeback had roots dating back decades and offers a valuable primer on his approach to life and politics as his second term begins.

The documentary is drawn from FRONTLINE’s vast archive of incisive reporting on Trump across nearly a decade as well as new interviews with White House insiders and journalists conducted after Trump’s 2024 election victory.

“In the scope of American history, it’s almost unbelievable. In the scope of Donald Trump’s life, it’s kind of routine,” Trump biographer Marc Fisher says in the film. “The story of his life is massive swings between utter failure and glorious victory.”

“Trump’s Comeback” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser and Vanessa Fica. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.
