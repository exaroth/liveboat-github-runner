We know we humans are conscious and we strongly suspect higher animals are as well: for example, primates, dogs, cetaceans, whales and dolphins. But how far down the phylogenetic scale does consciousness go? Do fish feel pain? Do insects have awareness? Do bacteria sense? What are the implications?

Whether God exists may depend on whether God is necessary. ‘Necessary’, in the philosophical sense, means ‘impossible not to exist’. Even if God exists, would it have been possible for God not to exist? Namely, even if God does exist, could it have been otherwise? If it were possible that God not exist, then why would God, as God is defined, exist at all?

Does the concept of observation have deep relevance in fundamental physics? What about in quantum physics where some kind of observation seems to be needed to transform “wave function” probabilities into actual events? What’s an “observation” anyway? What does it take to be an “observer”? Must it have some kind of sentience?

If ESP can claim some kind of truth, the implications would be profound. The confirmation of any ESP, no matter how minor, would challenge the materialism-physicalism structure of the world, built over centuries by science. Reality itself would expand. But extraordinary claims, such as for ESP or parapsychology, require extraordinary evidence.

We know we humans are conscious and we strongly suspect higher animals are as well: for example, primates, dogs, cetaceans, whales and dolphins. But how far down the phylogenetic scale does consciousness go? Do fish feel pain? Do insects have awareness? Do bacteria sense? What are the implications?

Panpsychism is the theory that consciousness is irreducible and exists fundamentally at the foundations of reality. Panpsychism forms include ‘micropsychism,’ where fundamental particles or fields are in some sense conscious, and ‘Cosmopsychism,’ where the entire universe is in some sense conscious. What are the arguments for and against Panpsychism like the ‘combination problem’?

Speaker(s): Karan Jagtiani

---

This session is a practical, demo-driven walkthrough of how I being a cloud architect use an open source AI copilot called Skyflo.ai to speed up day-to-day DevOps and SRE workflows, without sacrificing safety or compliance. We'll dive into a real incident in a live Kubernetes environment with a Jenkins deployment, where the audience will see the AI agent in action, and how I prompt the agent to triage the incident, decide on the next steps, and act on it. Attendees will see how teams are cutting incident response time by utilizing Skyflo and it's human-in-the-loop approach.

Key Takeaways:

    Learn how I cut down incident response time by 50% at Storylane by using an AI copilot
    See how to use an AI copilot to speed up your Kubernetes, Argo, Helm, and Jenkins workflows
    Understand the human-in-the-loop architecture of Skyflo and behind the scenes of how it works


Live Demo Plan (70% time):
1) Trigger a deployment on Jenkins using Skyflo
2) Wait for the agent to report back with the status of the deployment
3) The pipeline will succeed, but the deployment in Kubernetes will fail
4) The agent will go through a process of discovery to find the root cause of the issue
5) The agent will decide on the next steps and act on it

Under-the-Hood (30% time):

    Brief Architecture Tour: How LangGraph and MCP are used to power the Skyflo agent
    Custom MCP Server: kubectl/helm/argo/jenkins with typed parameters and validation
    Streaming over SSE: Live events over Redis pub/sub and server-sent events over MCP

Speaker(s): Ayushi Midha, Aishwarya Urne

---
In the world of digital accessibility, silence is seldom neutral. For users of screen readers, a missing announcement can mean confusion, distrust, or exclusion—yet the issue often remains invisible to most developers and designers. In this talk, we’ll explore how the absence of spoken feedback impacts accessibility, trust, and user experience, particularly for people navigating dynamic web interfaces. Drawing on real-world examples and practical scenarios, we’ll examine the root causes of “silent failures” (such as missing ARIA live regions, improper roles, stale live-region content) and discuss how seemingly minor markup decisions ripple into major accessibility barriers. Attendees will walk away with a clear framework for diagnosing and remedying these silent gaps: from audit strategies and end-user testing through to implementable code patterns, best practices for dynamic announcements, and how to integrate these into your UI/component library workflow. Whether you’re working in React, Web Components, or template-driven apps, you’ll gain actionable insights to ensure your components announce properly, your users feel heard, and your silent UI becomes truly inclusive.

**Key take-aways:**

Why missing announcements matter: the user-experience impact beyond visual cues

Common pitfalls in dynamic content, live regions, and state changes

A developer-friendly approach to audit, test, and fix announcement gaps

How to bake these practices into your component library or design system (for example, your team’s work with PatternFly and a custom theme)

Tips for collaboration between developers, UX designers, and accessibility testers to maintain accessibility as your product evolves

Speaker(s): Abhijeet Dhumal, Nikhil Kathole

---

Feature engineering is eating your training time. Data loading is your bottleneck. Sound familiar?
If your training jobs crawl, your features take forever to compute, or your pipeline breaks every time you scale, this talk is for you.

In this session, we’ll show how to turn a slow, file-based ML pipeline into a distributed, production-ready architecture using modern open-source tooling:
- Feast for feature management
- Ray for distributed data processing
- Kubeflow Training Operator for orchestrating distributed training on Kubernetes

We’ll demonstrate an end-to-end pipeline, powering a Temporal Fusion Transformer trained on 421K rows of Walmart sales data. Using PyTorch DDP across multiple GPUs, how we can cut training time, while hitting 10.5% MAPE (compared to the typical 15–20% industry baseline).

You’ll see:
- Faster feature loading using Ray + Feast
- Raw data flowing through a fully managed feature platform
- Distributed PyTorch jobs launched and scaled with Kubeflow Training Operator
- Production inference path powered by Feast’s hybrid storage & compute
- How Ray transforms feature engineering performance at scale
- How Feast standardizes feature computation across training & inference

You’ll leave with a repeatable blueprint for building ML pipelines that scale as your models, data, and teams grow, along with the confidence to adopt these tools in your own production environment.

Speaker(s): Mansi Agarwal

---

The world of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and modern deep learning share a core DNA: the demand for near-linear scaling across hundreds of nodes. The core challenges remain the same—managing communication, balancing load, and coordinating resources but the abstractions and tooling are now defined by PyTorch Distributed.

This talk bridges the gap between traditional HPC paradigms and PyTorch's distributed computing ecosystem, designed specifically for deep learning workloads. We'll explore how familiar HPC concepts like collective operations, point-to-point communication, and process groups, manifest in PyTorch's distributed APIs. We'll discover how PyTorch builds upon battle-tested communication backends (NCCL, Gloo, MPI) while introducing novel primitives optimized for gradient synchronization and model parallelism. We then move beyond basic data parallelism to explore advanced memory-saving techniques like Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), PyTorch's native answer to memory scaling and touch upon the nascent Tensor and Pipeline Parallelism APIs, demonstrating how these techniques compose to train massive models.

This session equips you with a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch's distributed architecture and reveals the inner workings of one of the most actively developed areas in modern ML infrastructure. By mapping distributed systems concepts to PyTorch's implementation, you'll see how familiar patterns from parallel computing manifest in PyTorch's ecosystem and where there is still room for innovation and improvement.

Speaker(s): Sagar Sundaray, Vinod Pathangay

---
Accurate prediction of the battery range of electric vehicles requires periodic update of the prediction model as there are changes in battery parameters with time and variation in driving dynamics. Federated Learning (FL) offers the following two advantages for model update: (1) It aggregates learnings from data patterns of fleet of vehicles to provide a sophisticated model that has been trained on wide range of scenarios. (2) It protects the privacy of the vehicle user without sending raw data to the central repository for model updates. With simulated vehicle data and Flower FL framework, a range prediction solution has been developed in a manner so as to easily port to an embedded edge Texas Instruments platform. The edge component can run as a quality managed (QM) component where as the central model aggregation can run as a containerized application on-prem or cloud where communication is established using gRPC.

Speaker(s): Prasanth Baskar

---

We have all seen it. Your GitOps tool reports Synced in seconds, but your edge node pods are stuck in ContainerCreating/ImagePullBackOff for minutes... hours. This is not just a low bandwidth problem. it is a fundamental design flaw. We are trying to apply a centralized, cloud-native architecture to a decentralized, distributed-systems problem.

This leads to slow startups, failed updates even worse pullSecrets on every node create a massive security risk. In this session with Harbor Satellite (subproject of goharbor) we will run a stateless distributed registry along with your container workloads
