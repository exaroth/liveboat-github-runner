Can biology be explained entirely in terms of chemistry and then physics? If so, that’s “reductionism.” Or are there “emergent” properties at higher levels of the hierarchy of life that cannot be explained by properties at lower or more basic levels?

Robustness, Detectability, and Data Privacy in AI // MLOps Podcast #289 with Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Student Researcher at Google DeepMind.

// Abstract
Recent rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made it widely applicable across various domains, from autonomous systems to multimodal content generation. However, these models remain susceptible to significant security and safety vulnerabilities. Such weaknesses can enable attackers to jailbreak systems, allowing them to perform harmful tasks or leak sensitive information. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into critical applications like autonomous robotics and healthcare, the importance of ensuring AI safety is growing. Understanding the vulnerabilities in today’s AI systems is crucial to addressing these concerns.

// Bio
Vinu Sankar Sadasivan is a final-year Computer Science PhD candidate at The University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. Soheil Feizi. His research focuses on Security and Privacy in AI, with a particular emphasis on AI robustness, detectability, and user privacy. Currently, Vinu is a full-time Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, working on jailbreaking multimodal AI models. Previously, Vinu was a Research Scientist intern at Meta FAIR in Paris, where he worked on AI watermarking.

Vinu is a recipient of the 2023 Kulkarni Fellowship and has earned several distinctions, including the prestigious Director’s Silver Medal. He completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar in 2020.

Predestination is ultimate destiny, fate. It is the claim by some religions that a Supreme Being, whether a personal God or a cosmic force, has determined for individual lives their ultimate course. When God foreordains, whether for salvation or for damnation, nothing can resist. Is this fair? Does this make sense? Would you like such a God?

Or did God so set the laws of nature before the foundation of the world such that God’s goals would be achieved without God’s special, active interventions?

AI & Aliens: New Eyes on Ancient Questions // MLOps Podcast #288 with Richard Cloete, 
Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Harvard University.

// Abstract
Demetrios speaks with Dr. Richard Cloete, a Harvard computer scientist and founder of SEAQR Robotics, about his AI-driven work in tracking Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) through the Galileo Project. Dr. Cloete explains their advanced sensor setup and the challenges of training AI in this niche field, leading to the creation of AeroSynth, a synthetic data tool.

He also discusses his collaboration with the Minor Planet Center on using AI to classify interstellar objects and upcoming telescope data. Additionally, he introduces Seeker Robotics, applying similar AI techniques to oceanic research with unmanned vehicles for marine monitoring. The conversation explores AI’s role in advancing our understanding of space and the ocean.

// Bio
Richard is a computer scientist and Laukien-Oumuamua Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard University. As a member of the Galileo Project under Professor Avi Loeb's supervision, he develops AI models for detecting and tracking aerial objects, specializing in Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). 

Beyond UAP research, he collaborates with astronomers at the Minor Planet Center to create AI models for identifying potential interstellar objects using the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory. 

Richard is also the CEO and co-founder of SEAQR Robotics, a startup developing advanced unmanned surface vehicles to accelerate the discovery of novel life and phenomena in Earth's oceans and atmosphere. 

Before joining Harvard, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge, UK, where his research explored the intersection of emerging technologies and law.Grew up in Cape Town, South Africa, where I used to build Tesla Coils, plasma globes, radio stethoscopes, microwave guns, AM radios, and bombs...

‘Neurophilosophy’ is the view that all that is mental or mind or consciousness can be solved ultimately by neuroscience. ‘Neuromania’ is the view that trying to explain consciousness by physical processes alone is impossible (if not ridiculous). The two views are diametrically opposed. Appreciate the arguments of each. Then decide, which is correct?

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

Synchronicity makes an extraordinary claim about reality—events may be linked in diverse and strange ways that defy all physical law, causality and common sense. What would it mean if events may relate to each other only by some kind of meaning, however obscure, not by some kind of physical interaction? This type of extraordinary claim demands extraordinary evidence.

Höss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about Höss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can see the History Hit film about the house here:You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'. He also has a new book out for children. It's called 'The House on the Canal: The Story of the House that Hid Anne Frank.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey and Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2265 - Kurt Metzger</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CSPkPOFzQvE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 18:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kurt Metzger is a stand-up comic, writer, and host of the "Can't Get Right with Kurt Metzger" podcast.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn sits down with esteemed philosophy Richard Swinburne to discuss how the problem of evil may provide a strong argument against theism, the theory of the Trinity, animals in evolution, and more.

Richard Granville Swinburne FBA is an English philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of "The Coherence of Theism", "The Existence of God", and "Faith and Reason". He has been influential in reviving substance dualism as an option in philosophy of mind.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
