It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Awareness Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

How to make sense of the Christian claim that there is only one God but three persons? Why is it that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—just three persons—compose that Godhead? Why is the Trinity such a central part of Christian theology? How is the Trinity justified, theologically or philosophically? What insights can the Trinity provide?

In the context of the resurrection of the dead, could God also reconstitute or restructure the entire physical universe? What could this mean? Our universe is immense. Suppose there are multiple universes? How far might God go?

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible. The Judeo-Christian scriptures tell of a future time when all things shall be made new. What could this mean? Does ‘all’ include the entire cosmos? Multiple universes, if there are such? Could such an ancient vision ever make sense? Believers say, “It’s God’s mystery.” They should say more.

During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it.

Panpsychism is the extreme claim that everything in the physical world—all subatomic particles-are in some sense ‘conscious’ or have a basic kind of ‘proto-consciousness’. Why are an increasing number of leading philosophers taking panpsychism seriously? Something must be up. Could it be doubt that the scientific project to explain consciousness has failed?

Is the enlightenment generated by meditation an altered state of consciousness, as much as can be induced by psychoactive chemicals like alcohol? Or is there something special about enlightenment that can illuminate the deep nature of consciousness and can even reach to ultimate levels of existence? Mystics make these grand claims. Is there any reality here?

// Abstract
Qualcomm® AI Hub helps to optimize, validate, and deploy machine learning models on-device for vision, audio, and speech use cases.

With Qualcomm® AI Hub, you can:

Convert trained models from frameworks like PyTorch and ONNX for optimized on-device performance on Qualcomm® devices.
Profile models on-device to obtain detailed metrics including runtime, load time, and compute unit utilization.
Verify numerical correctness by performing on-device inference.
Easily deploy models using Qualcomm® AI Engine Direct, TensorFlow Lite, or ONNX Runtime.

The Qualcomm® AI Hub Models repository contains a collection of example models that use Qualcomm® AI Hub to optimize, validate, and deploy models on Qualcomm® devices.

Qualcomm® AI Hub automatically handles model translation from source framework to device runtime, applying hardware-aware optimizations, and performs physical performance/numerical validation. The system automatically provisions devices in the cloud for on-device profiling and inference. The following image shows the steps taken to analyze a model using Qualcomm® AI Hub.

If God is perfect, does this mean that God cannot change? Since perfection cannot be improved, would any change diminish God’s perfection? But a changeless God has problems, such as relating to humans in sequence and not progressing. God is more complex than we can imagine, but trying to relate God’s changelessness to God’s perfection probes God’s essence.
