When earthquakes and tsunamis kill and maim, when children suffer painful illnesses and die young, where is the God who is supposedly all-powerful and all-good? When humans suffer severely, if the horrors are not caused by other human beings, it is called ‘natural evil’. For the theist, is natural evil more difficult to justify than moral evil?

Others say consciousness is irreducible and fundamental, whether part of ultimate reality or all of it. Does it make sense to explore consciousness and cosmos together?

Christology is the theology of Jesus—the person, life, nature, essence and meaning of the Godhead Being who was incarnated in the human person Jesus. Some Christian theologians claim that aspects of Christology can articulate with fundamental understandings of science. Most scientists would be baffled by the claim.

In every enterprise, value emerges from connections: customers to products, suppliers to shipments, molecules to targets. This talk introduces Relational Foundation Models (RFMs)—a new class of models that reason over interactions, not just data points. Drawing on advances in graph neural networks and large-scale ML systems, I’ll show how RFMs capture structure, enable richer reasoning, and deliver measurable business impact. Audience will learn where relational modeling drives the biggest wins, how to build the data backbone for it, and how to operationalize these models responsibly and at scale.Jure Leskovec is the co-founder of Kumo.AI, an enterprise AI company pioneering AI foundation models that can reason over structured business data. He is also a Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and a leading researcher in artificial intelligence, best known for pioneering Graph Neural Networks and creating PyG, the most widely used graph learning toolkit. Previously, Jure served as Chief Scientist at Pinterest and as an investigator at the Chan Zuckerberg BioHub. His research has been widely adopted in industry and government, powering applications at companies such as Meta, Uber, YouTube, Amazon, and more.

Charismatic, manipulative and unrepentant, he became the central figure of the proceedings. This episode examines Göring’s performance in the courtroom and his unusual relationship with U.S. Army psychiatrist Dr Douglas Kelley, who was tasked with assessing the mental state of the Nazi defendants.For this, we're joined by Jack El-Hai, author of ‘The Nazi and the Psychiatrist'. Through their exchanges, Jack explains how Göring sought to control his legacy and what his case revealed about the psychology of power and guilt in the aftermath of war.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Dougal Patmore.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2412 - Adam Carolla</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzSapYmzA_g</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mzSapYmzA_g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 18:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adam Carolla is a comic, actor, author, and host of “The Adam Carolla Show” podcast.

Andy Pernsteiner joins the podcast to talk about what it actually takes to build production-grade AI systems that aren’t held together by brittle ETL scripts and data copies. He unpacks why unifying data - rather than moving it - is key to real-time, secure inference, and how event-driven, Kubernetes-native pipelines are reshaping the way developers build AI applications. It’s a conversation about cutting out the complexity, keeping data live, and building systems smart enough to keep up with your models. Andy is the Field Chief Technology Officer at VAST, helping customers build, deploy, and scale some of the world’s largest and most demanding computing environments.Andy has spent the past 15 years focused on supporting and building large-scale, high-performance data platform solutions. From humble beginnings as an escalations engineer at pre-IPO Isilon, to leading a team of technical Ninjas at MapR, he’s consistently been in the frontlines solving some of the toughest challenges that customers face when implementing Big Data Analytics and next-generation AI solutions.~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~[00:00] Prototype to production gap[00:21] AI expectations vs reality[03:00] Prototype vs production costs[07:47] Technical debt awareness[15:40] Chaos engineering[22:25] Data messiness reflection[30:53] Platform engineer mindset shift[34:26] Gradient description comparison[45:48] Empathy in Engineering[51:04] GPU clusters rolling updates[1:03:14] Checkpointing strategy comparison[1:09:44] Predictive vs Generative AI[1:17:51] On Growth, Community, and New Directions]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Building an Open-Source Laptop with Byran Huang</title><link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2025/11/11/building-an-open-source-laptop-with-byran-huang/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=building-an-open-source-laptop-with-byran-huang</link><author>SEDaily</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://traffic.megaphone.fm/SED4585449469.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 10:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://softwareengineeringdaily.com/category/all-episodes/exclusive-content/podcast/">Podcast - Software Engineering Daily</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Byran Huang is a full stack developer who recently made headlines in the hacker space when he created the anyon_e, which is a highly integrated, open source laptop.
