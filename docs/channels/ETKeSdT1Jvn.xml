The resurrection of the dead would be a stunning event. It’s a core tenet of Judaism, Christianity, Islam: every person who ever lived brought back to life in judgment—for salvation and eternal life, or for punishment and torment. How would a resurrection really work? What literally happens? Granted a supreme being would do it, but what are its possible mechanisms?

Why are ‘belief systems’ so powerful? How do they control religion and politics and all ways of thinking from a scientific worldview to conspiracy theories? What is a ‘belief system’? It is a set of tenets or convictions that support each other, such that the whole system governs individual beliefs. How we believe may be more important than what we believe.

Spirituality requires consciousness because we need to be aware, and to be self-aware, in order to apprehend spirituality of any kind. But is there more to the relationship? Some make the extravagant claim that our human consciousness is somehow connected directly to a’ cosmic consciousness’? Can this make sense? If so, what would it mean?

But how to understand the scientific method itself and what is it really that science is learning? That’s the role of philosophy.

Conflicting religions fill the world. Doctrines about God contradict one another. No one denies the diversity of religions and the apparent incompatibility of their core beliefs. Many believe only their own religion to be the truth. Some claim all religions reflect the same truth. Others assert that differing dogmas expose the emptiness of all religion.

Assume that free will is real, not an illusion, and that the only reality is physical. How then could the will possibly be free? By what mechanism could human choice transcend the strong determinism of a closed physical world? One can try diminishing one side or the other: reducing free will or softening determinism, but each has its own difficulties.

What is it about science and theology that grips people so emotionally, as during a war, such that each is committed to his or her viewpoint (which often are sharply opposed to one another)? Each is fighting for its predominance, if not for its life: religion from being marginalized, science from being politically contained.

We've transformed this process by building a distributed multi-agent system that enables parallel quantitative evaluation of hundreds of product concepts. Our system combines three key components: an Agentic innovation lab generating high-quality product concepts, synthetic consumer panels using fine-tuned foundational models validated against historical data, and an evaluation framework that correlates with real-world testing outcomes. We can talk about how this architecture enables rapid concept discovery and digital experimentation, delivering insights into product success probability before development begins. Through case studies and technical deep-dives, you'll learn how we built an AI powered innovation lab that compresses months of product development and testing into minutes - without sacrificing the accuracy of insights.With over 15 years of leadership experience in AI, data science, and analytics, Luca has driven transformative growth in technology-first businesses. As Chief Data & AI Officer at Mistplay, he led the company’s revenue growth through AI-powered personalization and data-driven pricing. Prior to that, he held executive roles at global industry leaders such as HelloFresh ($8B), Stitch Fix ($1.2B) and Rocket Internet ($1B). Luca's core competencies include machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, data engineering, and computer vision, which he has applied to various domains such as marketing, logistics, personalization, product, experimentation and pricing.He is currently a partner at PyMC Labs, a leading data science consultancy, providing insights and guidance on applications of Bayesian and Causal Inference techniques and Generative AI to fortune 500 companies.

In "ChatGPT and the Future of AI", Terry Sejnowski offers a nuanced exploration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and what their future holds. How should we go about understanding LLMs? Do these language models truly understand what they are saying? Or is it possible that what appears to be intelligence in LLMs may be a mirror that merely reflects the intelligence of the interviewer? In his book, Sejnowski, a pioneer in computational approaches to understanding brain function, answers all our urgent questions about this astonishing new technology.

Terrence Joseph Sejnowski is the Francis Crick Professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies where he directs the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory and is the director of the Crick-Jacobs center for theoretical and computational biology.

Dualism is the theory that ultimate reality is composed of two radically different kinds of things, physical things and non-physical things, and that these same two kinds of things, expressed as body/brain and spirit/soul, account for consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Dualism (like the ‘interaction problem’)?

Abstract:
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has primarily been dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which can handle complex tasks and generate detailed responses. However, these models require significant resources, making them difficult to use in resource-constrained educational settings. This proposal explores how Small Language Models (SLMs) — simpler, open-source and more affordable AI systems — can transform education by offering personalized learning and scalable solutions, even in low-resource environments.

Introduction:
SLMs are smaller, simpler versions of AI models that are easier to use and cost less. Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which need powerful computers, SLMs can work on basic devices, making them ideal for schools with limited budgets. They maintain efficiency and accessibility while offering targeted solutions tailored to specific educational needs. By focusing on domain-specific knowledge, local languages, and contextual customization, SLMs address the equity and inclusivity gaps often exacerbated by larger models.

Methodology:
This approach leverages insights from recent implementations of Small Language Models (SLMs) in education. Key methodologies include:
1. Fine-tuning on Localized Data: Customizing SLMs to address specific learner needs and proficiency levels.
2. Using Lightweight AI Frameworks: Deploying open-source, resource-efficient tools for underserved communities and low-resource settings.
3. Integrating SLMs into Systems: Adding SLMs to existing learning platforms to create personalized plans and adjust lessons based on students' progress.
4. Real-World Success Stories: Demonstrating how SLMs enhance teaching through automation, support student progress, and operate efficiently without high-end infrastructure.

Demo Proposal:
We will showcase a live demonstration to highlight how Small Language Models (SLMs) can be effectively deployed in real-world educational settings. The demonstration will feature:
Personalized Learning Assistant:
A fine-tuned open-source Small Language Model(SLM) will be used to create personalized learning plans tailored to students' progress and feedback. The key benefits include:
1. Adaptability to Individual Needs: The system adjusts the complexity of learning materials based on each student’s progress. For slow learners, subjects are presented gradually, with difficulty levels, without overwhelming them. This step-by-step progression builds confidence, enhances engagement, and promotes a deeper understanding of concepts, contributing to their long-term success and mental well-being.
2. Affordability in Resource-Constrained Settings: SLMs are optimized for low-resource hardware, making them a cost-effective solution for schools and communities with limited budgets.
This demo will illustrate how SLMs can empower educators and improve learning outcomes, making quality education accessible to all.

Strengths of SLMs:
Small Language Models offer several key advantages for education:
1. Low Resource Requirements: They run on basic devices like low-cost laptops or mobile phones.
2. Cost-Effective: Affordable for schools with limited budgets or in developing regions.
3. Ease of Updates: Easy to adapt to new curricula or local content.
4. Privacy-Friendly: On-device processing ensures student data security.
5. Personalization: Tailors learning to individual student needs and paces.
6. Support for Local Languages: Adaptable to regional languages and cultural contexts.
7. Energy Efficient: Uses less energy, supporting sustainable AI use.
8. Scalable: Easy to implement across schools and districts.

Limitations of SLMs:
1. Less Powerful: SLMs may struggle with complex tasks like handling multi-disciplinary contexts or generating nuanced responses.
2. Performance Risks: Aggressively scaling down models can lead to degraded accuracy, especially for tasks requiring deep understanding.
3. Requires Careful Design: Achieving balance between simplicity and performance demands thoughtful optimization and regular evaluation.
