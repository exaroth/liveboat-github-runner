In this interview, Stephen Wolfram explores the concept of universal computation and how simple rules can generate intricate, seemingly random patterns. This perspective challenges traditional views of complexity in physics, biology, and beyond, revealing deep insights into the computational universe.

From the foundations of cellular automata to the discovery of surprising patterns in nature, Wolfram shows how computation reshapes our understanding of reality and revolutionizes the way we think about science.

What are the classical arguments used to prove the existence of God? For the Cosmological Argument we argue First Cause; from the Ontological Argument we argue Necessary Being; from Teleology we argue Design and Purpose. All are refuted and in turn defended in what seems to be a philosophical arms race. In the end, no one believes in God because of arguments, but they do help to develop our thinking about God.

Is consciousness deepest reality, the ground of being of the cosmos? If the question is “What brought all into existence?” the answer is “Consciousness”. Some say this is a ‘cosmic consciousness’ of which our personal consciousness is a small part. Others, that the ultimate consciousness is God. Others, that consciousness and cosmos are both deep reality.

The long straight boulevards, the fountains, the galleries and museums- even the bread that comes with European cuisine were brought in by Napoleon. He wanted to make it a city that reflected his imperial ambition. But this city shaped him too - Paris is where he went through his most formative experiences as a young man, where he first tasted power, seduction and revolution.Dan joins historian and expert guide Stephanie Paul in Paris to explore the story of Napoleon's early life here, how the city shaped him and how he created the Paris we recognise today.This episode is part of our 'Dan Snow's Guide to Europe' Series.Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore. The production manager was Beth Donaldson.Join Dan and the team for a special LIVE recording of Dan Snow's History Hit on Friday, 12th September 2025! To celebrate 10 years of the podcast, Dan is putting on a special show of signature storytelling, never-before-heard anecdotes from his often stranger-than-fiction career, as well as answering the burning questions you've always wanted to ask!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>James Hughes on Transhumanism and Personal Identity | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrhsUksyAlg</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lrhsUksyAlg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 15:01:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[James Hughes Ph.D. is the Executive Director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and a bioethicist and sociologist who serves as the Associate Provost for Institutional Research, Assessment and Planning for the University of Massachusetts Boston.

Normally, if we have a belief system, such as a particular religion, some kind of morality follows. Can the direction of causation go in reverse? If we commit to a particular morality, whether absolute or relative, are there implications for ultimate reality? Can morality say anything about the deep nature of the world?

In the summer of 1963, a gang of masked robbers executed a daring plan to intercept a Royal Mail train carrying millions of pounds in cash. But the robbery itself was just the beginning - what came after - the most wanted men on the run, the jailbreak, the betrayals, fake identities, the surreptitious flights to Latin America and the manhunt across continents - the audacity of it all captured the public's imagination for decades.Joining Dan is the author of 'The Great Train Robbery: Crime of the Century', Nick Russell-Pavier, who recounts the story of the robbery itself, as well as Colin Mackenzie, who secured one of the scoops of the century when he tracked down train robber Ronnie Biggs in Brazil.Produced by Mariana Des Forges, edited and sound designed by Dougal Patmore.Join Dan and the team for a special LIVE recording of Dan Snow's History Hit on Friday, 12th September 2025!
