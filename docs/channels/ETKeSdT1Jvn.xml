This week, we have a two-part series on the catastrophic First English Civil War. We trace the twists and turns of this tumultuous period from the perspective of Bulstrode Whitelocke and Edward Hyde, two close friends who reluctantly found themselves on opposing sides of the conflict that split England in two.For this, Dan is joined by Minoo Dinshaw, author of 'Friends in Youth: Choosing Sides in the English Civil War'. In this first episode, we learn how subtle religious and political differences upset the balance of power in England, and plunged the kingdom into chaos.Produced by James Hickmann and edited by Max Carrey.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DeepSeek, China, OpenAI, NVIDIA, xAI, TSMC, Stargate, and AI Megaclusters | Lex Fridman Podcast #459</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1f-o0nqpEI</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_1f-o0nqpEI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Feb 2025 00:12:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dylan Patel is the founder of SemiAnalysis, a research & analysis company specializing in semiconductors, GPUs, CPUs, and AI hardware.

Altruism, selfless concern for others, seems a challenge for evolution, as it seems the opposite of “survival of the fittest.” Why then is altruism so important in evolutionary studies? How does animal altruism relate to human morality?

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

Synchronicity makes an extraordinary claim about reality—events may be linked in diverse and strange ways that defy all physical law, causality and common sense. What would it mean if events may relate to each other only by some kind of meaning, however obscure, not by some kind of physical interaction? This type of extraordinary claim demands extraordinary evidence.

Höss was brought in by top Nazis to pioneer the industrialisation of the mass murder of Europe's Jews and others. He lived in a house that shared a wall with Auschwitz, metres from the crematorium, where he and his family enjoyed a happy domestic life - his wife once described their life at the house as 'paradise'.The house was home to a Polish family until last year when it was taken over by the Counter Extremism Project who invited History Hit to explore the house, which is largely as it was when the Hoss family lived there. Dan travels to Poland with historian and best-selling author Thomas Harding to discover more about Höss' role in the Holocaust and what the house teaches us about 'the banality of evil'. They learn about what went on there, what Holocaust artefacts were recently found in the attic and the future of the house as a centre to combat hate.Warning: this episode contains descriptions of human suffering and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.With special thanks to the Counter Extremism Project, Dr Hans-Jakob Schindler, Keith Burnet and Thomas Harding.You can find out more in Thomas' book 'Hanns and Rudolf: The German Jew and the Hunt for the Kommandant of Auschwitz'. He also has a new book out for children. It's called 'The House on the Canal: The Story of the House that Hid Anne Frank.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey and Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2265 - Kurt Metzger</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/CSPkPOFzQvE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 18:00:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kurt Metzger is a stand-up comic, writer, and host of the "Can't Get Right with Kurt Metzger" podcast.

Robert Lawrence Kuhn sits down with esteemed philosophy Richard Swinburne to discuss how the problem of evil may provide a strong argument against theism, the theory of the Trinity, animals in evolution, and more.

Richard Granville Swinburne FBA is an English philosopher. He is an Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford. Over the last 50 years, Swinburne has been a proponent of philosophical arguments for the existence of God. His philosophical contributions are primarily in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. He aroused much discussion with his early work in the philosophy of religion, a trilogy of books consisting of "The Coherence of Theism", "The Existence of God", and "Faith and Reason". He has been influential in reviving substance dualism as an option in philosophy of mind.

Is free will required for moral responsibility? If a person with a brain tumor breaks the law, should that person be judged by lower standards? It’s a slippery slope, because if a legal defense is based on a ‘my brain did it, not me’ theory, and if it holds, law enforcement will suffer. Our jails would be less crowded, but our streets would teem with criminals.

It was an integral part of the Nazi regime's rapid dismantling of German democracy. Within weeks, the first concentration camp, Dachau, was opened to imprison political opponents, marking the start of a vast and brutal system of camps across Germany and later in the occupied territories. The camps began as places to imprison political enemies and people the Nazis deemed to be “undesirables”. But, as the Second World War progressed, these camps became centres of industrial-scale genocide, with Auschwitz becoming perhaps the most infamous. In this episode, Dan is joined by Nikolaus Wachsmann, Professor of Modern European History at Birkbeck University of London. They discuss the historical context and horrors of Auschwitz, marking Holocaust Memorial Day on the 80th anniversary of its liberation by the Red Army.Warning: This episode contains a detailed discussion of the Holocaust and genocide which some listeners may find upsetting.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marc Andreessen: Trump, Power, Tech, AI, Immigration &amp; Future of America | Lex Fridman Podcast #458</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHWnPOKh_S0</link><author>Lex Fridman</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/OHWnPOKh_S0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 20:47:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA">Podcast - Lex Fridman</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marc Andreessen is an entrepreneur, investor, co-creator of Mosaic, co-founder of Netscape, and co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

Collective Memory for AI on Decentralized Knowledge Graph // MLOps Podcast #285 with Tomaz Levak, Founder of Trace Labs, Core Developers of OriginTrail.

// Abstract
The talk focuses on how OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph serves as a collective memory for AI and enables neuro-symbolic AI. We cover the basics of OriginTrail’s symbolic AI fundamentals (i.e. knowledge graphs) and go over details how decentralization improves data integrity, provenance, and user control. We’ll cover the DKG role in AI agentic frameworks and how it helps with verifying and accessing diverse data sources, while maintaining compatibility with existing standards. 

We’ll explore practical use cases from the enterprise sector as well as latest integrations into frameworks like ElizaOS. We conclude by outlining the future potential of decentralized AI, AI becoming the interface to “eat” SaaS and the general convergence of AI, Internet and Crypto.

‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible. The Judeo-Christian scriptures tell of a future time when all things shall be made new. What could this mean? Does ‘all’ include the entire cosmos? Multiple universes, if there are such? Could such an ancient vision ever make sense? Believers say, “It’s God’s mystery.” They should say more.

Dan is joined by Professor Julie Greene to delve into the long backstory of this 50-mile waterway that changed the world. Its journey from concept to completion was fraught as many nations sought to build it over several centuries, with the US eventually taking up the costly task in the 1900s. During the decade-long construction, many workers, mostly from the Caribbean, suffered awful working conditions and were injured or died building it. Total control was handed over to Panama in the 1990s.Better understand the headlines with this deep dive into history.You can learn more in Julie's books 'Archival Secrets, Caribbean Workers, and the Panama Canal' and 'The Canal Builders.'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Max Carrey]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2261 - Warren Smith</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7Hrq8WL1-g</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/m7Hrq8WL1-g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 18:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Warren Smith is an educator and founder of the Secret Scholars on YouTube.
