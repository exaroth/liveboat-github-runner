Private prayer at home has never been impacted by this Act.“This is shocking and shameless misinformation from VP Vance, who is either very badly informed about what my Act has done or he is knowingly misrepresenting it. "He is one of the most powerful people in the world but he is peddling total nonsense and dangerous scare mongering.“Nobody should be intimidated or harassed when accessing healthcare, and I am proud that my Act has put a stop to the graphic banners and the protests that far too many people were being forced to pass in order to access healthcare.“I was proud that our Parliament voted to back safe access zones so overwhelmingly, and that they stood against the cynical lies and misrepresentation of the kind that Mr Vance is promoting."“The government that Mr Vance represents is a clear threat to reproductive rights. He has a shocking record on abortion and many other issues. He has supported calls to reduce access to healthcare and has even argued for a national ban on abortion rights across the US.“Abortion rights are human rights and they are healthcare. Today and every day I will stand with the millions of people across the US who oppose the misogynistic and anti-choice agenda of Donald Trump and JD Vance.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Revised UNITED-poster from earlier, added some countries I forgot and couple honorary additions.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ipx2gi/revised_unitedposter_from_earlier_added_some/</link><author>/u/EEVERSTI</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:27:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ghana in Talks With IMF to Refine Its Program, President Says</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2E-NQ42nn0</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/P2E-NQ42nn0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 07:00:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ghana’s new administration has started talks with the International Monetary Fund to refine its $3 billion bailout program to address concerns over ambitious revenue targets, President John Mahama said in an interview.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Vance’s fiery address to Europe; Zelensky open to peace talks, and more</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/theeconomistmorningbriefing/episodes/vances-fiery-address-to-europe-zelensky-open-to-peace-talks-</link><author></author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/theeconomistmorningbriefing/e/67b03442f7ed892410bbc380/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3Mzk2MDA5MDY4MzgtY2JiZjhiMDktYWRlNS00YTVkLTlhYTctNjZhODhlZmYyZDI0LXB1YmxpY0ludHJvLm1wMyIsIm91dCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3Mzk2MDA5MDk3MzgtM2QxYzFjMjUtOTZjZC00MzlkLWFkZWMtYzEzNTYxNDgyN2JjLXB1YmxpY091dHJvLm1wMyIsInN0YXR1cyI6InB1YmxpYyJ9&amp;sig=YpaRLrJh1_0yDCLiOHOk9pTHH4vz_nDBszbf_QVJW2Q" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:34:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-world-in-brief">News - Daily Brief</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Japan Cracks Down on Exploitation in $21 Billion Anime Industry</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELF4mcRzVVA</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ELF4mcRzVVA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 06:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The popularity of anime has skyrocketed over the past decade — but the success has come at a price.

That is unacceptable, and it is not the Europe and not the democracy in which I live and am currently campaigning,” he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>WWE Wrestler Seth Rollins on the Move to Netflix</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goo-zB-Lacw</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/goo-zB-Lacw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 04:00:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[WWE wrestler Seth Rollins joins Bloomberg's Kim Bhasin to talk about getting "WWE Raw" on Netflix and the power of live sports.

While no more than 5,000 drones were produced in Ukraine in 2022, the end of 2024 saw more than 1 million [first-person view] FPV drones sent to the front line alone,” Shymal wrote in an opinion piece for Politico.According to Shmyhal, Ukrainian troops can also replace Washington’s 65,000 personnel in Europe, which might be an option as the new administration is looking at scaling back its involvement in Europe.“Ukraine’s battle-hardened military could become an alternative to the US army, which currently has over 65,000 troops in the EU, its largest deployments stationed in Germany, Italy and Spain,” Shmyhal said.“In addition to its practical significance, this decision could strengthen relations with the US, as Washington increasingly questions the need for its military to be stationed overseas,” he added.On Wednesday, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hinted that the new administration might shift its resources from Europe to protect its interests in other theaters.In the Politico opinion piece, Shmyhal also advocated for Ukraine’s EU membership, saying that Ukraine is filled with resources and is “a country that knows its worth and is honest with its allies.”“The EU is our conscious choice, not a temporary whim. And we’re proving the sincerity of our intentions, arms in hand,” he added.Creating an EU army is nothing new, with some member states agreeing to form the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in 2017, a security initiative that enhances military collaboration among member states by developing joint defense projects and improving interoperability.French President Emmanuel Macron has been a strong advocate for the initiative, and he floated the idea of a “true, European” army during US President Donald Trump’s last presidency in 2018.As Ukrainian military news outlet Militarnyi noted, the EU also hosted its first joint military exercise in October 2023.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zelensky refuses to sign document on transfer of 50% of Ukrainian mineral resources to the US - WP | УНН</title><link>https://unn.ua/en/news/zelensky-refuses-to-sign-document-on-transfer-of-50percent-of-ukrainian-mineral-resources-to-the-us-wp</link><author>/u/RGV_KJ</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 21:49:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A delegation of the US Congress in Munich wanted President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to sign a document that would give the US rights to 50% of Ukraine's future mineral resources, but he refused.

Starmer later fired back at Musk and accused him of “spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible.”(With inputs from agencies)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Zelensky refuses to sign document on transfer of 50% of Ukrainian mineral resources to the US - WP | УНН</title><link>https://unn.ua/en/news/zelensky-refuses-to-sign-document-on-transfer-of-50percent-of-ukrainian-mineral-resources-to-the-us-wp</link><author>/u/EsperaDeus</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 19:31:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A delegation of the US Congress in Munich wanted President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to sign a document that would give the US rights to 50% of Ukraine's future mineral resources, but he refused.

On Thursday, she said Google had not resolved Mexico’s earlier complaints.“If necessary, we will file a civil suit,” she said. “Even President Trump isn’t proposing that the entire Gulf of Mexico be called the ‘Gulf of America,’ but only their continental shelf. So Google is wrong.”She urged Google to review the decree from the White House, arguing “the only place it was effective was where (the U.S.) has sovereignty, or up to 22 nautical miles from the coast.”Story continues below advertisement“We categorically reject the slander made by the White House against the Mexican government about alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempt to intervene in our territory,” Sheinbaum wrote on social media. “If there is such an alliance anywhere, it is in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups.”Sheinbaum said the Mexican government has “seized more than 40 tons of drugs in four months,” including “20 million doses of fentanyl,” and has “arrested more than ten thousand people linked to these groups.”“If the U.S. government and its agencies want to address the serious fentanyl consumption problem in their country, they could, for example, combat the sale of narcotics on the streets of their major cities —  something they do not do — as well as the money laundering generated by this illegal activity, which has caused significant harm to their population,” she added.Sheinbaum also suggested that the U.S. could “launch a massive campaign to prevent drug consumption and protect their youth,” like Mexico has done.“Drug consumption and distribution occur in their own country, and that is a public health problem they have not addressed. Moreover, the synthetic opioid epidemic in the United States originates from the indiscriminate prescription of these medications, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as demonstrated by the legal case against a pharmaceutical company,” Sheinbaum wrote.Story continues below advertisement“Mexico does not seek confrontation. We believe in collaboration between neighbouring countries. Mexico does not want fentanyl to reach the United States — or anywhere else. Therefore, if the United States truly wants to combat the criminal groups that traffic drugs and fuel violence, we must work together in a comprehensive manner, but always under the principles of shared responsibility, mutual trust, collaboration, and, above all, respect for sovereignty — which is non-negotiable. Coordination, yes; subordination, no.”On Feb. 2, the governors of Mexico’s 31 states and Mexico City backed Sheinbaum in a joint statement.“We energetically condemn the accusations that suggest there is a link between our government and narco-trafficking cartels,” it said. “These claims are not only baseless, they also ignore the major, verifiable efforts Mexico has made to combat organized crime,” the statement read.Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s economy minister, said on X that Trump is hurting himself.“Accusing the Mexican government of being an ally of narco [traffickers] is — apart from an insult to our country – a pretext to distract US public opinion from the tremendous mistake of imposing disruptive tariffs on Mexico and North American companies that operate here. Shooting oneself in the foot,” Ebrard wrote.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>German defense minister says Vance speech in Munich ‘not acceptable’</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/german-defense-minister-says-vance-speech-in-munich-not-acceptable/</link><author>/u/Affectionate_Cat293</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:46:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Royal Society urged to expel Elon Musk as fellows sign open letter</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/14/elon-musk-royal-society-open-letter-academics</link><author>/u/Curious_Suchit</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:31:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pressure is growing on the Royal Society to expel Elon Musk from its fellowship after more than a thousand scientists signed an open letter expressing dismay at its lack of action on the matter.Musk, who owns the social media platform X, leads the US “department of government efficiency” (Doge). He was elected a fellow of the UK’s national academy of sciences in 2018 as a result of his work and impact in the space and electric vehicle industries.However, the Royal Society is under mounting pressure to revoke the honour.In August, the Guardian revealed a number of fellows had written to the Royal Society expressing concern over Musk’s comments regarding unrest in the UK and calling for him to be stripped of his fellowship.Prof Dorothy Bishop, a leading expert on children’s communication disorders at the University of Oxford, subsequently resigned her fellowship because of a lack of action by the Royal Society, with Andrew Millar, a professor of systems biology at the University of Edinburgh, following suit this week, as first reported by Research Professional News.More than 1,700 members of the international scientific community have signed an open letter to the president of the Royal Society, Sir Adrian Smith, with signatories including Bishop, Sir Richard Peto – an eminent statistician and Royal Society fellow – and Prof Susan Michie of UCL, a behavioural scientist who became a household name during the Covid pandemic.Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, said he was motivated to write the letter out of frustration at the organisation’s continued silence.“This isn’t an HR complaint about harassment or bullying or anything like that. This is a matter of behaviour that is entirely public,” he said. “Everybody can see what Musk has said and what he’s doing as head of Doge, and the Royal Society, which claims to have a strong voice for science within the UK, but actually, even on the international stage, has said absolutely nothing.”The letter notes the Royal Society was made aware of fellows’ concerns more than six months ago, and that since then Musk has made further incendiary comments.These include calling the MP Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, a “rape genocide apologist”. Phillips has said the comments made her more worried about her safety.“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry writes.The letter states the situation is rendered more serious because of Musk’s new position within a Trump administration that, Curry writes, “has over the past several weeks engaged in an assault on scientific research in the US that has fallen foul of federal courts”, noting that concerns have also been raised over censorship, particularly in the realm of climate scienceThe letter adds that the lack of comment by the Royal Society about Musk’s fellowship, other than its reiteration that concerns around individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence, “increasingly looks like a failure of moral courage”.Curry said he hopes the letter, as well as the recent resignations, would highlight to the Royal Society the breadth and depth of feeling within the scientific community about Musk’s fellowship.“If they believe at all in the values that they espouse in their code of conduct, then they really have to come out and explain to people why is it that they think that Musk’s behaviour is consistent with [them],” he said.The Guardian understands there is to be a meeting of the Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 March to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.A spokesperson for the Royal Society said: “In the event of any concerns raised about the behaviour of a fellow, the Society has a clear set of processes described in our code of conduct, which is published on our website along with relevant disciplinary regulations. Any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence.’’]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
