Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure," he added.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have said that the slate of incidents in the Baltic Sea must be assumed to be part of a hybrid strategy from Russia that is threatening European countries.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Federal judge limits DOGE’s access to payments data; Hamas frees more hostages, and more</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/theeconomistmorningbriefing/episodes/federal-judge-limits-doges-access-to-payments-data-hamas-fre</link><author></author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/theeconomistmorningbriefing/e/67a830f23ef0b176ea59fbda/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3MzkwNzU3NzAxNjgtYmM1MjA5ODYtMTJjYy00NjNlLWJlZjgtYjQ4YzE0MzRkZDJhLXB1YmxpY0ludHJvLm1wMyIsIm91dCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3MzkwNzU3NzM4NTEtZGVjOGQ0ZmEtOGYxNS00YWI1LWEyNWMtOWMyMzM0YzdlYzY5LXB1YmxpY091dHJvLm1wMyIsInN0YXR1cyI6InB1YmxpYyJ9&amp;sig=FFJBVVNfJujNmkHkMX-XUagHQaF1X3XYHR4V_IehU64" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 04:52:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-world-in-brief">News - Daily Brief</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump reveals he’s spoken with Putin by phone, says Russian president ‘wants to see people stop dying’ in Ukraine war</title><link>https://nypost.com/2025/02/08/us-news/trump-and-putin-in-talks-to-end-the-russia-ukraine-war/</link><author>/u/EsperaDeus</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 04:37:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Mini Dramas Are Becoming Popular in China</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJOeetZ4R8A</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/AJOeetZ4R8A?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Feb 2025 01:00:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The rise of the mini soap opera is a new phenomenon in Chinese media, and global venture capitalists are starting to take note.

The declared goal is to cut the wealth of billionaires in half within a decade."We believe there should not be any billionaires," the paper from party co-chair Jan van Aken states, before going on to outline a five-point plan designed to make this position a reality. What are the Left's new tax plans? The party proposes reintroducing Germany's "wealth tax" which was abolished after the Constitutional Court deemed it unconstitutional in 1995. This tax was not focusing on income, but on people's accrued wealth. The party proposes a sliding scale, 1% for fortunes in excess of €1 million ($1.03 million), 5% for those higher than €50 million, and 12% for those higher than €1 billion.Next, the party calls for a one-off fee for the richest 0.7% of citizens, starting at 10% for those with more than €2 million, and rising as high as 30% for larger sums. The party also aims for a higher inheritance tax for larger estates, and higher rates of income tax for top earners. This would include a 60% income tax on salaries above €250,000 and 75% for those over €1 million. Finally, capital gains taxes should no longer be a flat 25% fee, but rather should operate on a sliding scale like income tax depending on the extent of the gains on assets.Party co-leader van Aken draws parallels to new 'super-rich' US governmentWhen launching the new proposal, van Aken alluded to Donald Trump's new administration in the US. "The new government is made up of the super-rich and the right, who are doing everything to secure their fortune and their power," he said.In Germany, too, van Aken argued, the very wealthy used their fortunes to secure unreasonable political influence. The Left Party had been struggling in the polls in recent years amid the rise of the far-right AfD. While the Left Party draws political roots from the former socialist regime in the now-defunct GDR, this region is now a stronghold of the AfD. Left Party candidate calls German migration debate awful Edited by: Darko Janjevic]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump wants a deal for Ukraine’s natural resources as ‘payback’ in exchange for aid stopping Russia attack: envoy</title><link>https://nypost.com/2025/02/07/us-news/trump-wants-a-deal-for-ukraines-natural-resources-as-payback-in-exchange-for-aid-stopping-russia-attack-envoy/</link><author>/u/broc944</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 22:24:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Japan faces Trump&apos;s reciprocal tariffs on farm goods and autos</title><link>https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/Japan-faces-Trump-s-reciprocal-tariffs-on-farm-goods-and-autos</link><author>/u/maxleslies</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 21:44:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TOKYO -- A U.S. reciprocal tariff plan to be announced as early as Monday is likely to subject Japanese goods to new duties, but exactly what type of products will be affected depends on the details of the policy, which have yet to be revealed.As described by U.S. President Donald Trump, if a country imposes a 10% tariff on a certain kind of import, Washington will respond with its own 10% tax.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anti-Nazi protests : Berlin 16/12/1931</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ikxc1u/antinazi_protests_berlin_16121931/</link><author>/u/anon58588</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 20:51:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>US judges block some of Musk&apos;s efforts to shrink federal agencies | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviKVJ1aEbk</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JviKVJ1aEbk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 20:30:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elon Musk's US government-efficiency team was stopped from carrying out some of its plans to shrink federal bureaucracies as two judges made temporary rulings in separate cases against them.

The latest rallies came after an estimated 160,000 people marched in Berlin last weekend to protest recent overtures by Germany's conservatives to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of fraught elections this month.Munich police initially put the turnout for the latest demonstration, dubbed "Munich is multicolor," at 100,000 people, then upped their estimate to more than 200,000 shortly after it began.With legislative elections two weeks away, demonstrators rallied under the slogan "democracy needs you," warning against any party working together with the AfD.Germany has long had an unwritten rule against working with the far right, dating back to the aftermath of the horrors wrought by the Nazis in World War II.But protesters say the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the frontrunner for the February 23 vote, breached that so-called "firewall" by seeking the AfD's support in parliament for an anti-immigration bill.Organizers, who put the turnout at 320,000, said the Munich march aimed to send a "strong signal in favor of diversity, human dignity, cohesion and democracy". Protesters on Munich's famed Theresienwiese, a sprawling esplanade in the city center, carried placards attacking CDU leader Friedrich Merz, bearing messages such as "Shame on you!" Another protest in the northern city of Hanover drew 24,000 people, according to police.The CDU has ruled out forming a government with the AfD, which is polling in second place ahead of the elections.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Canada seeks stronger EU trade ties in face of Trump tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-seeks-stronger-eu-trade-ties-both-regions-threatened-by-trump-tariffs-2025-02-08/</link><author>/u/twotwo_twentytwo</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:39:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Victims grieve tower&apos;s demolition years after Grenfell blaze | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeTUeykZVqk</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QeTUeykZVqk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Feb 2025 17:11:29 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hamid Ali Jafari is one of many grieving the British government’s decision to demolish the remnants of Grenfell Tower.
